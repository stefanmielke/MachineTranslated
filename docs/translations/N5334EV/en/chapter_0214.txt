# 202 Episode 202 Niven's Brothers.

I understood from an early age that I was special.

<blank>

While the children around me were frantically chasing after the flying insect, I was able to hold it in my hand with just a light touch of my hand.

I couldn't understand why they were so desperate for something so simple.

I didn't feel anything in particular about the fact that it would stop working so easily if I put some effort into my hand.

I also did not understand the commotion of the children around me who were watching.

<blank>

Before I can remember, I must have wanted my parents' affection as much as anyone else, but all such feelings disappeared without a trace at a very early stage.

When I heard that his mother had passed away, I also vaguely understood that this involved a being called his father.

<blank>

A father is not a person to whom you seek affection or shelter.

On the contrary, he understood very early on that the only thing it asks of him is "whether it is easy to use or not.

<blank>

But that doesn't make me particularly afraid of my father.

What this man wanted was easy to understand. He was easy to deal with, and all I had to do was present him with what he wanted.

Once I was severely beaten with a stick, but it did not change my opinion of this man in any way. I had long since understood that its true nature was an abomination.

<blank>

For him, the world was easy, flat, and indeed boring.

But one day I realized that the reaction I get when I pick up and dismantle the wings and legs of a small winged insect gives me a slight emotional movement.

It didn't take me long to realize that it was "pleasure" or "enjoyment.

<blank>

The only time I could feel color in the world was when I was indulging in this pleasure.

It was a natural progression for him that the object would gradually grow in size.

<blank>

Still, the world remained boring.

<blank>

The smoldering urge inside him that tells him that he should use all his strength to crush those who resist him is probably something he inherited from his father.

I saw this trait in my younger brother, who is older than me.

However, unlike the two members of his immediate family, he himself recognizes that his impulses are trivial.

It is easy to suppress that urge.

<blank>

Every time I witnessed the two soles, who tended to give in to their impulses, I was reminded of the immaturity of their spirituality.

Especially my brother's sobriety is just like a toddler's tantrum. I always saw it as a sign that he was a lowly human being who never grew up.

<blank>

They show us how stupid and ugly human nature really is.

<blank>

Because of their half-way intelligence, human beings are truly irredeemable.

The narrow-mindedness that can only see things from its own perspective.

The arrogance of thinking that one's good sense is all there is in the world.

I am beyond dismayed at their inability to comprehend their own diminutive size.

<blank>

The fact that I was related to such a repulsive being was unforgivable.

<blank>

<blank>

It was also around this time that I felt something like despair at the tightness of that society.

I felt no attraction to the world, and only emptiness enveloped me.

<blank>

Sometimes I would playfully crush people, organizations, and insects as if I was shaking their wings, but it was just a way to pass the time out of boredom.

For him, the world was as colorless and flat as ever.

<blank>

<blank>

But one day, his world changed forever.

The moment I met him, his overwhelming presence captivated my soul.

Tears wet my cheeks as I kneel down to witness for the first time in my life, the beauty and the way of being.

It was then that I realized how small I was.

I understood that I was on par with those who should be ashamed to even be alive.

<blank>

But the euphoria I feel by kneeling before this person.

For the first time in his life, he thanked the gods for their guidance in bringing him to this person.

<blank>

Nope! He is the messenger of the gods. I was found by him!

I was born to meet this person!

When he was convinced of this, he had no hesitation in offering his soul to that person.

<blank>

And just the other day, he was finally allowed to climb the stage.

Until now, we have only been given a small portion of that precious power.

It was still a joyous occasion, but at last we were allowed to go beyond.

<blank>

The corpse-eater seemed to have a cocky sense of superiority over me because he had crossed the human barrier years before me.

But when I realized that his favor was heavily tilted in our direction, I unnecessarily increased my sense of rivalry.

It is a foolish story that only shows that you are of lowly origin after all.

<blank>

But now, at last, I am an entity beyond the human realm.

Words cannot begin to express my joy and gratitude.

He vowed to devote himself entirely to the cause and to demonstrate this through his own actions.

<blank>

<blank>

However, I cannot leave the little insect that has injured this gifted body as it is.

I know where they are.

The first proof of our loyalty to him will be to face him now and give him what he deserves.

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"I've got a bad feeling about this ....... Lurie, let's hurry up."

What?　Don't make me run around here!　Besides, Emma and Zoe aren't here!

<blank>

Reilly Niven was holding a longsword that he pulled out in his right hand and grabbed Lurie Deet's hand with his left hand and ran toward where the camp office was located on a road that opened into the woods.

<blank>

There may be an evacuation drill tonight during camp. ...... and Woodley and Ben brought that up.

This has been communicated to each group leader in due course, so it will probably be implemented without a doubt.

I don't know what time it will take place, but you should be prepared because your actions at that time will count toward your personal score. That said.

<blank>

When I heard about it, I genuinely thought it was a load of crap.

Still, this is a school that prides itself on tradition. It is only natural that they respect discipline.

At the same time, he was also of the opinion that he could not bring any more disgrace to the family name.

Until recently, he had been under house arrest himself for a crime committed by his father.

<blank>

I was told that my father committed treason. I honestly don't know what happens after that.

My father will probably not escape the maximum punishment. The whole family could be punished for this crime.

But the family got away with it by cutting off his father and brother.

<blank>

Later, my uncle on my mother's side told me, "You are the one who will take over.

They told me that my uncles would assist me until I was on my own.

I had no choice but to save my sickly mother.

But I was more than grateful.

<blank>

They had been trembling with fear and trembling alone for a long time, wondering if a heavy punishment would fall on them without knowing why.

But that is why I thanked ...... with tears in my eyes for receiving such warmth, and my uncles for running around for it.

<blank>

<blank>

When the signal to muster came, Emma panicked and twisted her ankle. Woodley and Ben are taking Emma to the medical tent. Zoe is her escort."

Tch!　What a time for this!　He can't use ......!"

We're in a hurry. We're way behind the rest of them.

What?　Are you trying to say it's my fault?

I didn't say that. Come on, let's go."

Wait!　Don't leave me!　I'll run, I'll run!"

<blank>

Ruly Deet's mouth is still leaking out swears, but his hands are still forceful enough to never let go of Reilly's hands, and his eyes still never leave Reilly's.

The two silently hold hands and hurry down the forest path where a bonfire is cooking.

<blank>

A shadow suddenly fell over them.

Tonight is a night when the moon is hidden by clouds and no moonlight reaches us.

The pale magical lights of the warding devices can be seen at the far end of the forest, but the only source of light here is the bonfires placed in places to illuminate the path.

The anomaly of a shadow falling from above stopped them both in their tracks.

<blank>

I was a little surprised to see you still here. I was a little surprised."

<blank>

Reilly's eyes widened involuntarily at the sudden sound of a chilling voice.

<blank>

Oh!　Brother?　Is your brother ......?　Why are you here at ......?"

<blank>

Reilly is astonished.

Suddenly, a voice came from the darkness, the voice of the brother they knew so well, the one who ...... had driven them into a corner.

<blank>

But it's convenient, isn't it?

<blank>

The face that emerges from the darkness is still that of Reilly's familiar older brother.

<blank>

I'm just in time. Shall we clean it up nicely here?"

<blank>

But his eyes are glowing red like coals, and the expression on his face when he looks at Reilly is not the way he would look at his own flesh and blood.

It is simply cold and devoid of emotion.

<blank>

'Why ...... why, brother!　Why did you do that?

Oh, my God.

"I have heard that you have wounded my father!　I also heard that you secretly drew in the troops of another country!　Such ...... treachery against such a nation!"



"Crap, crap?"

I did indeed arrange for the crossing of the country of the knight of Anatolis, but it was that man's evil heart that sought and brought him in. However, I could not make good use of his power. This is an indication of that man's incompetence. But I don't really care about the strength of that man's army.

<blank>

You said, "Oh, I've been ...... me!　I've always ...... had my brother as my goal for a long time!　That's what I ...... and yet ......!!!"

<blank>

For Reilly, his older brother, the undisputed best, has been his admirer and goal since he was a child.

As they grow older, they realize that this goal is something they will never be able to reach.

He often blamed everyone around him for his own inadequacies.

<blank>

Still, the occasional word from Van makes him happy or sad.

Even when he understood that his brother was out of reach, he still felt the same way.

<blank>

Someday, I want to be recognized by my brother.

Someday, I want to be someone who can help my brother.

<blank>

That is the thought he has always held in his heart.

<blank>

That is the proof that you don't know your own size. It is precisely because you think you can reach out that you are so arrogant."

Such as ...... such as ............"

<blank>

Dear Van!　That's too bad!　Reilly has been working hard for a long, long time with you as her goal!　Even though she knew it was out of reach ......, still!

What does it matter?　What is the point of such meaningless efforts?　It's a waste of time. It's just a waste of time. And you want me to admit it?　Do you want me to waste my time as well?"

"...... and ...... up?"

What?　What?　...... what are you saying?

<blank>

At Van's words, Reilly's body lost its strength and he almost fell to his knees on the spot.

Ruly put his arms around the body, supporting Reilly, who was not strong enough to support himself, and shouted out.

But the words that continue to come out of Van's mouth make Lurie's eyes widen in disbelief.

<blank>

"You are equally incompetent as well, as far as I'm concerned, because you can't achieve anything despite the arrangements I've made for you.

Yes, what on earth are you talking about ......"

It's Karen. I have deliberately suppressed her will and directed your consciousness to frustrate Karen's mind. ......"

Hey, what are you ............"

In the end, Karen's heart could not be broken. It must be the difference between the original state of her heart and your poor nature. It is the difference between the strength of her will and your poor nature. It's really pathetic."

<blank>

"Did you ...... something ...... to ...... our spirit?　............ ah!"

<blank>

Lurie clamped her mouth shut in a sudden surge of nastiness that came up to her throat.

<blank>

Certainly Karen was not a person I liked. And I know why.

He also understood that he had an uncontrollable personality.

I know that I lose my temper and get blood rushing to my head immediately, and I don't need anyone to tell me that.

<blank>

But his feelings for Karen are even more uncontrollable than usual.

That black rage that rises in me when I turn to Karen is something I have never felt anywhere else.

It easily swells up and makes one's own eyes turn bright red.

I felt as if I was losing myself. But I didn't think it was strange.

<blank>

But you're telling me that was something that was twisted in from the outside?

Lurie Deet couldn't help but feel nauseous at the thought that something was eroding her mind.

<blank>

You can only wear the power of the family, and you are unintelligent and as far as I am concerned, you have no courage. You are nothing but spoiled, spoiled, lascivious people."

<blank>

Van drops his words coldly to Ruly, whose face is paling.

<blank>

The fact that you still exist is tantamount to a mischievous diminution of my value."

<blank>

Van raises his hand and lightly plays his fingers to make a dry sound.

As the sound echoes, Reilly and Lurie are still unaware that multiple signs are moving from the darkness behind Van.

<blank>

'Tear yourself miserably apart and end up here.

<blank>

I'm your brother!　Isn't he just a little brother to you ...... who just wanted to be a big brother?　That's it!　And yet!

<blank>

Van's ruthless words caused Lurie to scream in grief as she kept her hands around Reilly's body.

As if trying to protect his body, his arms are unknowingly caged with strength.

<blank>

The hand that has clung to me for so long has been a real pain in the ass.

<blank>

With a cold look in his eyes, just as Van uttered those words, something leaped toward them from the shadows behind him.

<blank>

The figure is illuminated by the bonfire, and for the first time, Ruly's eyes catch a glimpse of the vicious figure.

A four-legged beast with red eyes.

The snarling mouth is lined with a mess of sharp fangs.

<blank>

For a moment, Lurie didn't even know what was going on, just wide-eyed in amazement.

However, they soon realized that it was turning its fangs with intent to harm them, and their arms were tightened, and they reflexively closed their eyes tightly.

<blank>

You can hear the roar of the beast close to your ears.

When I prepared myself for its vicious fangs to bite into my body, I braced myself even more.

<blank>

What came into his ears was a high-pitched voice that sounded like the scream of a beast.

<blank>

What happened?　Ruly opened his eyes slowly, and what he saw were several wild dogs sewn up in midair in a pouncing position.

The "Terror Dogs," wild dog monsters, were pierced by multiple thorns growing out of the ground and skewered on the spot, bleeding from the mouth, eyes, and everywhere else, and had died.

<blank>

Huh?

<blank>

A scream goes up from Lurie's mouth at the gruesome sight.

<blank>

Mwah?

<blank>

Van extended the claws of his own right hand like daggers in an instant, and swung his arm vigorously as if to cut the darkness behind himself.

Immediately after, a sharp metallic sound echoes through the area and sparks fly.

<blank>

I didn't know they had such good night vision," he said. I didn't know they could see as well as cats and dogs.

<blank>

The huge blade of a two-handed sword emerges in the darkness with sparks.

Although stopped by Van's dagger-like claws, the two are not overpowered, and they clash with each other, making a scrabbling sound.

<blank>

Let's just get this over with.

<blank>

With a ferocious smile, Irving Haggard says in a challenging manner.
