# Interlude 4: Let's Go to the Hot Springs!

The last post of the New Year! I somehow made it in timeーー＞＜

<b>

It's bath time! It's the time for fun and laughter in the bath!! (≧▽≦)

----------------

<b>

The sound of a bucket hitting the floor echoes around.

The gentle sound of water splashing in the tub resonates softly.

<b>

What spreads out before me is a large bathhouse in the seaside town of New Noxport.

Moreover, it's a rock bath, an open-air bath!

And, surprisingly, it's a hot spring!

Apparently, this town has a hot spring vein, and it's said that it was dug and created about 200 years ago.

Hmm! It’s probably the work of a hero! Good job!!

<b>

This hot spring is located in a mansion called "Green Mansion."

Two hundred years ago, this mansion was still the lord's residence of New Noxport, so it wouldn't be strange for it to have an open-air hot spring.

<b>

Last year, when Carla and the others came to this town, we used the Croki family's villa since it was close to the sea, but this year, there were many opinions wanting to enjoy the hot springs together, so we decided to visit this mansion.

When we came last year, it was just the Cloud family that visited, but this summer, there was talk of wanting to come in large numbers, and the Green Mansion welcomed us warmly.

What kind of relationship do we have with the Green Mansion? The details will come later!

<b>

Right now, more than that……!

<b>

"……Ah, really, to be able to use such a large bath…… I'm so grateful."

<b>

Colin, who exudes an aura that doesn't seem like she's 15 years old, is causing ripples in the water with her hidden voluptuousness that is not apparent when she's clothed.

Her skin is still so white…….

She has taken off her glasses since she's in the bath, but the sight of her slightly blushing cheeks under her loosened hair is so alluring, why?!!

<b>

"Mmm～～～! Being able to stretch my legs feels so good～～!"

<b>

Dana, who is swimming on her back in the tub while saying that, has a well-defined body with toned arms and legs.

Honestly, the image of her not-small chest bobbing up from the water is quite something, don't you think?!!

<b>

"Dana! Swimming in the tub is against the rules!!"

<b>

The one who shouts with a voice that doesn't seem like she's 14 is Vivi.

Since she's originally slender with a very thin waist, she has a great figure when viewed from behind…….

She's the only one I can win against! I won't say where, though!!

As if reading my thoughts, Vivi shoots a sharp gaze in my direction!

Naturally, I avert my eyes. However, her gaze seems to say, "You're thinking something bad, aren't you?!" Ouch, it hurts, Vivi.

<b>

And in the direction I turned my gaze, there was someone stretching her arms high up, causing her ample assets to bounce like a collapsing iceberg creating huge splashes as it sinks into the sea.

Naturally, waves crash around, spreading like a minor flood.

The culprit who caused the water disaster is…….

<b>

"Ummーーーーー! It feels so goodーーー!"

<b>

Mia was stretching with a look of pleasure.

The very mass that caused the flood in the tub was bobbing and swaying in the water at Mia's chest! No? Is it bouncing?

In any case, it's still a formidable object! It's said that thing is still growing! Grrr!!

But! That whiteness, softness, and size are truly captivating!!

Watching it float and change shape amidst the waves, I feel like I'm about to have a nosebleed…… No! I must be getting lightheaded!!

<b>

"Su-chan, you can't put your towel in the water, okay?"

"That's right, Su! Soaking your towel in the tub is against the rules!!"

<b>

Mia says this as if she just realized, and Vivi points her finger sharply! Are they the rule enforcement characters?!

That's right, even though I know it's against the rules, I couldn't help but feel embarrassed, and I couldn't move the towel away from in front of my body.

<b>

Recently, I've been quite aware that my mentality has become more feminine, but until not long ago, I was seeing things from a male perspective…… From that perspective, this is like a scene from heaven…… but still!

I feel a tremendous resistance to showing my body openly like everyone else.

To put it plainly, it's "embarrassing"!

<b>

When entering the bath, I hurriedly washed my body and quickly jumped into the tub.

You might think, what is this innocence?! but!

Because it's embarrassing!! There's no helping it if something is embarrassing!!

<b>

"Ah, um……. Umuuhhh"

<b>

As I was blushing and fidgeting, whether from embarrassment or the heat, someone approached me, splashing through the water. It was Dana.

When Dana came close to me, she gently placed her hand on my shoulder and then…….

<b>

"Su!! How long are you going to hide behind the towelーー!"

"Ahhpyahpyahpyahhh!!"

<b>

She suddenly snatched the towel I was using in the water and hugged me from behind!

<b>

"Hmm? Yep! You're definitely growing! Good, good! Let's keep this upー!"

"Ughh! W-wait…… ah! N-nooo!"

"Yup, yup! Feels good! Hehe."

"Ugh! D-don't, that's too much!"

<b>

Dana's impressive chest was pressed against my back, creating quite a heavenly sensation, but this is not the time for that!

While hugging me, Dana directly grabbed my assets, checking their size and feel!!

As I squirmed, Dana's hand continued its assault.

<b>

"Hehehe!"

"Ughhh!!"

<b>

With a loud splash! The moment that happened, a tremendous sound echoed throughout the large bathhouse.

<b>

"Whoa, whoa, whoa!!!"

"Dana! Enough already, that's indecent!"

<b>

Colin seemed to have hit Dana's head hard with a bucket.

<b>

"Ah! My head is splitting! It hurts so much! It's splitting! It's definitely splittingーー!!"

<b>

Holding her head, Dana writhed on the spot and sank into the tub!

<b>

"Geez! Su is also troubled, right?! Calm down a bit!"

"Ahpyuh?!"

<b>

From my perspective, it's not like I'm troubled at all!

While saying that, Colin pulled me close and started rubbing her cheek against mine!

<b>

"Ah, as always, it feels amazing to hug you. It's really so soft. Thinking that I have to say goodbye to this……"

<b>

Colin, with her hidden voluptuousness, has something even more impressive than Dana by one or two sizes.

Being pressed against that directly, hugged, and even rubbed against, it's no wonder that my insides are in turmoil!!

<b>

"Ahpyu! Ahh! Wh-what are you doing?!"

<b>

While hugging me, Colin was also rubbing all over my body!!

C-Colinーー! D-don't rub my back like that!!

What kind of situation am I in, being sexually harassed even in someone else's bath?!

<b>

While I was thinking about such things, Colin's rubbing continued, and soon I was hugged from behind by Dana, and being sandwiched between four mountains, I had no choice but to spiral into confusion as usual!!

<b>

Creating huge waves in the water, I was being tossed around as usual, and Vivi looked at me with an exasperated gaze. At that moment, I didn't notice that there was another gaze on me.

Yes, with heavy breaths and shining eyes, Mia was looking at me, her hands rubbing together as if she wanted to knead something!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

That night, being captured and dragged into Mia's bed, writhing without being able to make a sound, was it not an unavoidable situation?!

<b>
