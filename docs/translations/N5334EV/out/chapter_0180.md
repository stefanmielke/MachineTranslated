# 168 The Guards of the Backstreets

## 168話　裏通りの衛士達

I'm not impressed that you'd go into a place like this with just the girls."

*「こんな所に女の子だけで入り込むなんて、感心しないな」*

&nbsp;

The red one I had marked is farther back. It's still way over on that corner.

*マークしていた赤いのはもっと後ろの方だ。まだあの角のずっと向こうに居る。*

At least the person who just approached me is not red.

*少なくとも今声をかけて来た人物は赤くない。*

And his tone is a bit stern and scolding, but with a hint of gentleness.

*それにその口調は、少し厳しめに叱りつける様な物だけど、僅かに優しさも含んだものだ。*

&nbsp;

'You're a traveler? Didn't they teach you that when you entered the city? It is very dangerous for a small group of people to enter a place like this.

*「旅行者か？街に入る時に教わらなかったのか？少人数でこんな所にまで入り込むなど、大変危険な行為なんだぞ」*

&nbsp;

Two men dressed as guards approached us.

*声をかけて来たのは、衛士の格好をした2人組だった。*

The two were breathing slightly hard, as if they had come running in a great hurry.

*大慌てで走って来た様に、2人は僅かに息を荒くしている。*

&nbsp;

Even at ......, these two are pretty decent guards, aren't they?

*……でも、この2人、随分まともな衛士だな？*

The guard at the entrance to the city looked like a real thug, badly outfitted. ......

*街の入り口にいた衛士は、装備を酷く着崩して、マジのチンピラにしか見えなかったんだけど……。*

These two are well dressed and are comparable to the guards in other cities such as Amkam and Dekembel.

*この2人は身なりもちゃんとしていて、アムカムやデケンベルなど他所の街の衛士さんと比べても遜色が無い。*

His expression is tight and he appears to be an honest person.

*表情も引き締まっていて、実直な人に見える。*

One person's shoulder patch has one more line, so it looks like a boss and a subordinate?

*片方の人の肩章は線が一本多いから、上司と部下って感じかな？*

Is he really of the same species as the entrance guard who had a loose face?

*緩み切った顔だった入り口衛士と、本当に同種の人間なのだろうか？*

&nbsp;

No, nothing in particular was said ......"

*「いえ、特に何も言われては……」*

'No explanation given? At all! What is the person in charge doing!"

*「何の説明もされていない？全く！担当者は何をやっているんだ？！」*

Guard Chief ...... is in charge of the guys in squad 5 today."

*「衛士長……今日の担当は5班の連中です」*

Shit! Ladies, let's hurry back to the main road! You got a place to stay? If I know the name, I'll send you there!"

*「クソ！お嬢さんたち、急いで大通りまで戻るぞ！宿は取ってあるのか？名前が分かっていればそこまで送る！」*

&nbsp;

The two turned their backs to us as if to protect us, as if to warn us of the area, and said they would take us back to the inn.

*その2人はわたし達を守る様に、辺りを警戒する様にコチラに背を向け、宿まで送ると言い出した。*

Hmm? This is not what I expected. What's going on here? As I was making eye contact with Bibi, they appeared from the corner where we had turned.

*ふむ？想定していた事態では無いな。ココはどうしたものかしら？とビビと目を合わせていると、わたし達が曲がって来た角からそいつらが顔を出した。*

&nbsp;

What's that? Aren't these the guards at the entrance of the city?

*ありゃ？コイツら街の入り口に居た衛士じゃん？*

He finds Mia and smiles a nifty smile.

*ミアを見つけて、ニチャァとした笑いを浮かべている。*

Wow! This guy is creepy! Seriously, he's just a thug, isn't he?

*うわっ！キモいなコイツ！！マジで只のチンピラじゃね？*

&nbsp;

As you can see from my first impression, these guys were wearing their uniforms in a messy and, to put it bluntly, disheveled manner.

*最初の印象通り、こいつ等は制服を汚く着崩していて、ありていに言ってだらしが無い。*

Moreover, if you look closely, the stains on the clothes are quite noticeable!

*しかもよくよく見れば、服の汚れも結構目立って何だか凄くキチャナイ！*

&nbsp;

In comparison, the people in front of me now are neatly dressed in their guards' uniforms, and their appearance and movements seem disciplined.

*それに比べて、やっぱり今目の前に居る人達は衛士の制服をキチンと着込み、佇まいや動きに規律を感じる。*

&nbsp;

"...... Shit!"

*「……クソ！」*

'Ladies, I'll protect you no matter what. See an opening and run to the main street."

*「お嬢さん方、何があっても守ってやる。隙を見て大通りまで走れ」*

&nbsp;

Seeing the thug, the two guards who were standing by us gave a small snide remark.

*そのチンピラを見て、わたし達のそばに居た衛士2人が小さく毒付く。*

&nbsp;

"Well, look who it is, the head of guard Crunch of Team 2, isn't it? Selling oil in a place like this?"

*「おやぁ、誰かと思えば2班のクランチ衛士長じゃないか？こんな所で油売りかよ？」*

We're on patrol. What are you doing here? This is not the jurisdiction of Team 5.

*「我々は警ら中だ。そっちこそこんな所に何の用だ？此処は5班の管轄では無いぞ」*

We got a call. I'm on duty right now."

*「通報があったんでな。今まさに職務中ってヤツだ」*

&nbsp;

They look at us with an unpleasant smile on their faces.

*不快な笑みを浮かべながら、そいつらがコチラに目線を送って来る。*

&nbsp;

Oi! You girls there! Why don't you behave yourselves? I'm going to have to ask you to come to the guardroom."

*「オイ！そこの娘達！大人しくしろよ？お前らには詰所まで来てもらうぞ」*

"At the Tsumesho? Can you tell us why?

*「詰所にですか？！理由をお聞かせ願いませんか？！」*

He said, "I'm suspicious when you're hanging around these back streets! I'll take him in anyway."

*「こんな裏通りをウロウロしてる時点で怪しいんだよ！取り敢えず連行する」*

We were just looking for a shortcut to the hotel!

*「アタシ達はホテルに向かうため、近道を探していただけです！」*

I'll listen to what you have to say. Come on!"

*「話は詰所で聞いてやる。良いから来い！」*

&nbsp;

The thuggish guard modo comes to me, grinning and answering to Bibi, and reaches out his hand.

*チンピラ衛士モドキが、ビビに対してニヤニヤと答えながら手を伸ばして来る。*

No questions asked?

*問答無用ってか？*

That's a very arrogant thing to say. Is it natural because he's a thug?

*中々に横暴な物言いだ。チンピラだから当たり前か？*

I would like to say a few words here.

*ここは一つ、わたしも一言述べさせて頂こう。*

&nbsp;

My father told me not to follow strangers in a new city.

*「父に、初めての街で知らない人には着いて行くなと言われて、います」*

"Yeah? We are guards! Can't you see that?

*「ああ？オレ達は衛士だ！見てわかんねぇのか？！」*

"EMT, is this ......? I'm sorry, I don't understand.

*「衛士さん……です、か？すいません、ちょっと分かりま、せん」*

You're naive! Look at me! You're just like them, aren't you?

*「世間知らずかよ！よく見ろ！そいつ等と同じだろうが！？」*

You say, "...... What? Isn't it? Compared to the people here, you look much poorer, don't you?"

*「……え？そうでしょう、か？こちらの方々と比べると、随分貧相に見受けられます、よ？」*

What the hell?

*「なんだとぉ？！」*

I wonder if they are the ones who imitated the outfits? And. And ......"

*「格好を真似された方達なのかな？と。それに……」*

&nbsp;

He took out a handkerchief, held it to his mouth and showed it with a raised eyebrow.

*ハンカチを取り出し、口元を押さえて眉根を寄せて見せた。*

Then, furthermore, he dropped one incendiary word, miryu!

*そして更に、煽りの一言を投下してみりゅ！*

&nbsp;

It's a little too smelly for me to want you to go near.

*「ちょっと臭すぎて近寄って欲しくありま、せん」*

"......!!!!"

*「……！！」*

&nbsp;

When I said, "It stinks," one of the guards on this side of the room blew up. I said, "It stinks," and one of the guards on this side of the room blew up. The one who was called "Chief Crunch Guard" slightly twitched his cheek, "...... oui oui oui," and stepped forward as if to protect me.

*わたしが「臭い」と言い放ったら、こっち側の衛士の人が「ぶふっ！」っと吹き出していた。クランチ衛士長と呼ばれていた方は、「……オイオイ」と僅かに頬を引き攣らせ、わたしを庇う様に前へ出た。*

&nbsp;

No, no, no, no, no, no!

*「て、てンめぇえぇぇ！」*

I guess I'm going to have to teach you a lesson!

*「身の程ってのを教えねェと、わかんねぇようだな！」*

&nbsp;

Two of the goons are red in the face and look like they are about to let the steam out of their heads.

*チンピラの2人は顔を真っ赤にして、頭から湯気でも出しそうな勢いだ。*

&nbsp;

Wait a minute! They are not criminals! They're civilians!

*「オイ待て！相手は犯罪者じゃ無い！一般市民だぞ！」*

Move! Crunch!

*「どけ！クランチ！！」*

We'll decide that!"

*「それは俺達が決める！」*

&nbsp;

Do you think I would let such lawlessness pass me by?

*「そんな無法を私が見逃すと思うか？！」*

&nbsp;

The one called "Mr. Crunch" got between us and the thug guards and tried to control their movements with his body.

*クランチさんと呼ばれた方が、わたし達とチンピラ衛士の間に入り、身体を張ってそいつらの動きを制しようとする。*

However, as if they were annoyed that Mr. Crunch had stopped them, the two hoodlums' faces changed.

*だが、クランチさんに制止をされた事が癪に障ったかの様に、チンピラ2人の顔つきが変わった。*

&nbsp;

You don't get it, do you? Oi! Crunch!

*「分かってねぇ様だな？！オイ！クランチ！！」*

We have the right to make decisions! Have you forgotten that?

*「決定権があるのは俺達だ！そんな事も忘れちまったのかよ？！」*

&nbsp;

That's not true!

*「そんな事は！！」*

Don't get carried away, Crunch! You got a little crush on my daughter? Yeah?

*「調子に乗ってんじゃねェぞクランチ！娘を思い出して絆されたか？あぁ？！」*

"...... you!"

*「……貴様！」*

&nbsp;

One of the goons held Mr. Crunch by the throat with his arm and pushed him forcefully against the alley wall.

*チンピラの1人がクランチさんの喉元を腕で抑え、そのまま路地の壁に力まかせに押し付けた。*

&nbsp;

How are your wife and daughter? Have you seen their faces lately? Baboon!

*「女房と娘はどうよ？最近ちゃんと顔は見れてんのか？ヒヒ！」*

OH, ......!"

*「おのれ……！」*

Hey! You guys, come on. ......"

*「おい！お前らいい加減に……」*

You too, Martell! You too, Martell!

*「てめぇもだマーテル！てめぇも調子に乗ってんじゃねぇ！」*

&nbsp;

The second thug pushes the other guard, whose body is still pushed against the wall.

*もう一人の衛士さんを、2人目のチンピラがその身体をやはり壁に突き飛ばす。*

This guard is said to be Mr. Martel.

*この衛士さんはマーテルさんと言うらしい。*

&nbsp;

With the impact of the large man's body slamming into the wall, pieces of the wall, like clods of dirt, fall from above.

*大きな男の身体を壁に叩き付けた衝撃で、上の方からパラパラと土くれの様な壁の破片が落ちて来る。*

&nbsp;

Whether people live here or not, the area is almost a slum, and the condition of the buildings is quite bad because they are not cared for.

*人も住んでいるのかいないのか、この辺は殆どスラムって事らしいので、建物の手入れも成されずその状態は結構酷い。*

&nbsp;

Looking toward the top of the wall where the clods had fallen, I saw several flowerpots placed in the overhanging window.

*土くれが落ちて来た壁の上の方に目線を向ければ、張り出した窓に置かれた幾つかの植木鉢の様な物が目に入る。*

It must not have been cared for for a long time. The wooden planks that extend over the edge of the window to hold the pots are so tattered that they look as if they are about to fall down.

*もう随分手入れもされていないのだろう。鉢を置く為に窓の縁にはみ出す様に敷かれた板がもうボロボロで、今にも崩れ落ちて来そうに見える。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But what is this?

*しかし何だろうねコレは？*

The scene of a legitimate guard being held down by a thug is an unbelievable scene unfolding in front of our eyes.

*真っ当な衛士さんをチンピラが押さえ付けていると言う、到底有り得ない光景が目の前で展開されているワケだ。*

Who's the picture of a dirty little thug wall-donning a dignified guard-sama?

*小汚いチンピラが、凛々しい衛士様を壁ドンしているとか誰得の絵面よ？！*

&nbsp;

I gave a small sigh and quickly picked up a coin ......1c copper coin in my skirt pocket.

*わたしは小さくため息をつきながら、スカートのポケットの中にあるコイン……1c銅貨をソッと摘まみ取った。*

He plays it with his thumb and shoots it diagonally upward.

*それを親指で弾き、斜め上方へと撃ち出す。*

For a moment, there was a small, high-pitched metallic "kin! The two hoodlums did not seem to pay any attention to the high-pitched metallic sound.

*一瞬辺りに「キン！」と言う甲高い金属音が小さく響いたが、チンピラ二人は気に留めた様子も無い。*

&nbsp;

The coin instantly shattered the tattered boards on the window.

*コインは一瞬で窓に敷かれていたボロボロの板を粉砕した。*

The multiple flowerpots on it descend straight down without defying gravity.

*そこに乗っていた複数の植木鉢が、重力に逆らう事無く真っ直ぐ下に降下する。*

Then, as if sucked in, it hit the two hoodlums directly on the head.

*そしてそれはまるで吸い込まれる様にして、チンピラ2人の頭に直撃したのだ。*

&nbsp;

Gabapetto! Ngobap!

*「ガぺッ？！！」「ンごばっ！！」*

&nbsp;

The two who received direct hits made funny noises and fell into a coma on the spot.

*直撃を受けた2人は、おかしな声を出してその場で昏倒した。*

I knew a helmet was important!

*やっぱヘルメットって大切だよねぇ～。*

Two of the guards were wearing proper helmets, but the two goons took a direct hit to their bare heads and this is what happened. ......

*ちゃんとした衛士のお二人は、きちんとヘルメットを着けておられるのに、チンピラの二人は剝き出しの頭に直撃を受けてこの始末……。*

&nbsp;

It's bad enough that you're right under a collapsing building, rampaging around without a care in the world about the area.

*崩れかけの建物の真下で、辺りを気にもせず暴れているのが悪いよね。*

If they had been wearing helmets, this tragedy would not have happened.

*ヘルメットを装着していれば、こんな悲劇は起こらなかっただろうに。*

&nbsp;

What an unfortunate lot, you know."

*「なんとも不運な方達です、ね」*

&nbsp;

Bibi and Mia look at me with a jealous look in their eyes at my silliness.

*そんなわたしのシラッとしたセリフに、ビビとミアがジト目を向けてくる。*

&nbsp;

Yes, I know what you're looking at me like that, okay?

*いあ、そんな目をしてもわたしには分かっているからね？*

Mia would put weights on the falling pots, doubling their weight, right?

*ミアは落ちて来る鉢にウエイトをかけて、重さを倍にしてたでしょ？*

Bibi was using an air curtain to set the trajectory of the fall, wasn't he?

*ビビはエアカーテンを使って、落ちて来る軌道を整えていたよね？*

&nbsp;

When I complained about it with my eyes, they both swept their gazes in the wrong direction. Noooo .......

*その事を目で訴えてやると、2人共あらぬ方向へと視線を泳がせる。ぬぅ……。*

&nbsp;

What the hell? What the hell is ......?"

*「何だ？何が一体……」*

Something fell from above. It's not safe to be near the wall, okay?"

*「上から何かが落ちて来たよう、です。壁際は危険です、よ？」*

&nbsp;

The two guards were unable to swallow the situation when the two hoodlums suddenly collapsed.

*突然ぶっ倒れたチンピラ2人に対し、衛士の2人が事態を飲み込めずにいた。*

When I explained the situation to him, his eyes widened again and he said that it was dangerous here and carried the two fallen hoodlums to a safe place.

*わたしが状況を説明すると改めて目を見開き、ここは危険だからと倒れているチンピラ二人を安全な場所へと運んで行く。*

&nbsp;

I can't leave it like this. Martell! You watch the two of them! I'll go to the guardroom and get someone."

*「流石にこのまま放置は出来んな。マーテル！二人の様子を見ていてくれ！私は詰所まで行き人を呼んで来る」*

&nbsp;

I told him not to move me because I had hit my head, and the head guard said, "Sorry to bother you, but ......" and said he would take us to the main street.

*頭を打っているから動かさない様にと言い含め、衛士長は「ついでで申し訳ないが……」と言いながら、わたし達を連れて大通りまで案内してくれると言う。*

&nbsp;

As we walked away, I thanked him for his help and said, "No, on the contrary, I am sorry for being so ungrateful," the chief guard said, as if embarrassed.

*歩きながら「助けて頂き、ありがとうございました」とお礼を言うと「いや、逆に不甲斐なくて申し訳ない」と、恥じ入った様に衛士長は仰る。*

&nbsp;

Even so, I was impressed by the fact that the chief of guards was so considerate of such a thug, and I was impressed by the fact that there are good people everywhere. I was moved by this.

*それでも、あんなチンピラに対しても気遣いを忘れない衛士長様に、出来た人物というのはどんな所にでも居るものなのだな。と、わたしは小さく感動を覚えていたのだ。*
