# 66 Jules Nard's Escape

## 66話　ジュール・ナールの逃走

Damn! Oi! You guys! Go get that girl! You can be a little rough with her, but don't hurt her! But don't hurt her! Yes, sir!

*「クソッ！オイ!貴様ら！あの娘を攫って来い！多少手荒な真似はしても構わん！だが傷物にはするなよ！良いな！！」*

&nbsp;

Cameron Fourier made no attempt to hide his irritation, and gave orders to the five guards he had brought with him in a foul-mouthed manner.

*キャメロン・フーリエは苛立ちを隠そうともせず、語気を荒げて連れて来た5人の護衛に命令を下した。*

&nbsp;

The rest of you come with me and escort me! We're going back to Copetown! You two bring my daughter back there!

*「残りは私と来て護衛をしろ！コープタウンまで戻るぞ！お前達は娘をそこまで連れて来い！！」*

&nbsp;

Houlihan said this quickly, and then immediately headed down the aisle in the direction of his room.

*フーリエはそれだけを早口で捲し立てると、直ぐ様自分の部屋のある方向へと、通路を足早に向かって行った。*

&nbsp;

Two of the five men looked at each other and immediately followed Fourier.

*5人居る男の内、二人が目配せをし合うと直ぐにフーリエの後を追って行った。*

Two more men nodded to each other, fishing the corners of their mouths, and headed in the opposite direction.

*更に二人の男が互いに口角を釣り上げながら頷き合い、それとは反対の方向へと向かった。*

&nbsp;

Jules Nard, the last one left, was furrowing his brow, scratching his own calloused cheek with the fingers of his right hand, looking up at the ceiling with wide, droopy eyes.

*残った最後の1人、ジュール・ナールは眉根を寄せ、右手の指で自分のこけた頬を掻きながら、大きく垂れた目で天井を見上げていた。*

&nbsp;

I can't help it.

*どうにもいけない。*

When I turned my body toward them, grinning at the thought of an easy job, I felt as if I were being blocked by a huge, thick wall of steel, and I had no desire to move my body forward.

*小娘を攫えと言われ、楽な仕事だとニヤケながら向かった二人の方へ身体を向けると、巨大で分厚い鋼の壁にでも阻まれている様で、身体を進ませる気がまるで起きない。*

I tried to follow Fourier, but my legs seemed to be trapped in a heavy chain and would not move forward.

*それならばとフーリエの後を追おうとしても、やはり重い鎖にでも足が囚われている様で、足が前へ出ようとしない。*

&nbsp;

Is this a dead end?

*これは詰んじまったか？*

&nbsp;

He scratched his round nose and sighed heavily, as if he was troubled.

*自分の丸い鼻をコリコリと掻きながら、然も困った様に大きく溜息をつき呟いた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Jules Nard has been on the backstreets of society for as long as he can remember. He does not even know the faces of his parents and siblings.

*ジュール・ナールは、物心ついた時から社会の裏街道に身を置いていた。親兄弟の顔さえ知らない。*

We did whatever we had to do to survive.

*生きる為には何でもやって来た。*

Harming and robbing others. It was a natural act.

*他人を傷付け奪う。それは当たり前の行為だった。*

I don't particularly have a conscience about it.

*特にそれで良心が痛む事も無い。*

&nbsp;

It is no different than wild animals preying on other animals.

*野生動物が、他の動物を捕食するのと何ら変わらない。*

For him, it was a way of life.

*彼にとっては、それが生きる事だったからだ。*

&nbsp;

He had been living a life as swarthy as a wild animal in human society, but he has survived until today because of his absolute ability to sense danger.

*そんな、人の社会に於いて野生動物と変わらぬ剣呑な生活を送っていた彼が、今日まで生き抜いて来れたのは、その絶対的な危機察知能力があったからだ。*

&nbsp;

A path that should never be taken.

*絶対に進んではいけない道。*

A choice that should never be made.

*絶対に選んではいけない選択。*

&nbsp;

He has survived to this day by always believing in the divine warnings that emanate from within him.

*常に彼はその自らの内から発する、神憑り的な警告を信じる事で、今日まで生き延びて来れたのだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When I took this escort job, I thought it would be a very easy job.

*この護衛の仕事を受けた時は、随分楽な仕事だと思っていた。*

In fact, it is enough to be surrounded by the Knights and protect the inside of them. There is no way that anyone can transcend the walls of the knighthood.

*実際、騎士団に囲まれ、その内側を守っているだけで良いのだ。騎士団の壁を超える者などいる筈も無い。*

There is little to do on the move.

*移動中にやる事なども殆ど無い。*

Most of the time, I was in a carriage that could not be seen from the outside, and I was entertained in my own way.

*大抵は外から見えない馬車の中で、それなりに楽しませて貰っていた。*

&nbsp;

In the first place, it was really their job to guide and escort their employers on their travels to the under-the-radar places of amusement in the cities they were in.

*そもそも今回の雇い主が旅先の街々で、アンダーな場所へ愉しみに行く時の案内と護衛が、本当の意味で彼らの仕事だったのだ。*

&nbsp;

The employer has moderately good taste, so the stores that suit his taste end up being illegal stores in deeper places.

*雇い主は中々に良い趣味を持っている為、その趣向に合う店は、より深い場所の非合法な店となってしまう。*

Naturally, there was no way they could escort the knights, much less guide them, so it was up to them.

*当然騎士団を護衛に連れて行ける筈も、ましてや案内など出来る訳もないので彼らの出番となる。*

&nbsp;

This employer seems to have a great fondness for shagging young boys, and satisfying such a proclivity inevitably takes him far away from his official place of business.

*この雇い主は年端もいかぬ相手を甚振るのが大層好きらしく、そんな性癖を満足させるとなると、必然的に表だって商売をしている所からは大きく外れてしまう。*

Despite such a habit, he cares more than necessary only about the world.

*そんな趣向を持つ癖に、世間体だけは必要以上に気に掛けるのだ。*

&nbsp;

On one occasion, he told me that he had strangled himself during the act because he had been seen with his face in a lighted place. He also told me to clean up the mess.

*ある時など、灯りのある所で自分の顔を見られたからと、行為の最中にソレを縊ったと言って来た。ソレの後片づけをして置けとも。*

They also negotiated with the store for compensation for the damage and disposal of the product.

*店側に、その商品の損害賠償の交渉や廃棄も彼らがやった。*

Jules Nard was laughing as he processed the body of his daughter, who had become a mute figure.

*ジュール・ナールは　つくづく地位のある奴ほど好き勝手やるよな　と物言わぬ姿となった娘の身体を処理しながら苦笑していた。*

Jules Nard does not feel evasive or guilty about this kind of work. For him, it is just another ordinary task.

*こういった作業にも、ジュール・ナールは忌避感や罪悪感を覚える事は無い。彼にとっては在り来たりな作業の一つでしかないのだ。*

Cleaning up after their employers and cleaning up after themselves. Most of the work on this trip was like this.

*雇い主の後片付けや尻拭い。この旅での仕事は大体がこんな物だった。*

&nbsp;

Of course, we did a good job of escorting them.

*勿論護衛もしっかりやった。*

He had lived through the underworld from the beginning. He had a lot of confidence in his skills.

*元からアンダーな世界を生き抜いてきた彼だ。腕にも相当の自信があった。*

&nbsp;

I worked with the Knights and was able to estimate their competence with them.

*騎士団と行動を共にして、彼らとの実力も推し量れた。*

The group class can handle it with no problem. Even if they are surrounded by several people, they will be able to get out of the encirclement. Even the group leader class will have no problem.

*団員クラスなら問題無く対処できる。数人に囲まれても包囲を抜けられるだろう。班長クラスでも問題無い。*

But that battalion commander and his XO were something else.

*だが、あの大隊長と副長は別格だった。*

&nbsp;

I don't see those monsters.

*あんな化け物達は然う然う見ない。*

Unless you are a bodyguard of a big shot in the underworld, or a scavenger, you can't take on this guy.

*裏の世界の、それも余程大物のボディーガードか、始末屋の類でも無けりゃアレは相手に出来ない。*

Even he, who had faced many strong men, felt a power that made him feel that he was beyond his reach.

*多くの強者と渡り合って来た彼にも、自分には到底手が出せないと思わせる力を感じさせた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But even more shocking was the amcam.

*だが、それ以上に衝撃だったのがアムカムだ。*

&nbsp;

What in the world is it with these people?

*一体何なのだ此処の住人達は？*

&nbsp;

For a long time, there has been talk of Amcam from the mouths of underdog residents.

*昔から、アンダーな住人の口からアムカムの話は上がっていた。*

&nbsp;

Don't mess with the guys from Amcam.

*アムカムの奴等に手を出すな。*

If you are about to get into a fight with them, don't hesitate to run away without looking aside.

*もしも奴らと事を構えそうになったら、迷わず脇目も振らず逃げろ。*

They are untouchable. Don't think you have the numbers or the weapons to stop them. Don't get involved with them!

*奴らはアンタッチャブルだ。数や武器でどうこう出来ると思うな。奴らには関わるな！*

&nbsp;

I had heard such lines from time to time, but usually at the drinking table. I listened to them halfheartedly.

*そんな台詞を時たま耳にする事はあったが、大抵が酒の席での事だ。話半分に聞いていた。*

&nbsp;

But when I actually came to AMCAM, I realized that it was neither a metaphor nor an exaggeration.

*しかし実際にアムカムに来て見て、それが比喩でも大袈裟に風呂敷を広げていた訳でも無かった事を思い知った。*

The guy walking around there is clearly stronger than the group leader class.

*その辺に歩いている奴が、班長クラスより明らかに強いのだ。*

My own sense of smell is ringing off the hook, telling me to stay away from those people.

*自分の嗅覚が、そいつらには絶対近付くなとビンビン警報を鳴らしまくる。*

Some of them were far more monstrous than that XO and battalion commander.

*中には、あの副長や大隊長より遥かに化け物だと思える奴らが何人も居た。*

&nbsp;

I wonder to what extent the people they are hired with are aware of this...

*一緒に雇われている連中は、この事にどの程度気付いているのか…。*

At least two of them seem to feel some kind of discomfort. The person with such a keen sense of smell will live longer in this world.

*少なくとも二人は、何らかの違和感は感じている様だ。こう言った嗅覚が鋭い方がこの世界では長生き出来る。*

&nbsp;

But not the other two.

*だが残りの二人はダメだ。*

He was messing around with the maids here in the same sense as in the mansions where he had been taken care of by his employer in other cities.

*他の街で雇い主と世話になった屋敷と同じ感覚で、此処でもメイドにちょっかいを掛けていた。*

The maids were not touched by them, and they were able to avoid their hands with natural movements.

*メイド達は奴らに触れられる事無く、自然な動きで奴らの手を躱していた。*

They just tilt their heads and don't even think they're losing.

*奴らは首を傾げるだけで、躱されているとは思ってもいない。*

The maids here are a kind of monster. These people who don't even notice such things definitely won't live long.

*此処のメイド達もいい加減化け物の類だ。そんな事にも気が付かない此奴等は、間違いなく長生き出来ない。*

&nbsp;

Even now, he was laughing as he headed off, saying that kidnapping the lords' daughters was an easy job.

*今も、領主の娘を攫うのが楽な仕事だと笑いながら向かって行った。*

&nbsp;

Are they idiots? Are they?

*馬鹿なのか？アイツらは？*

&nbsp;

You think it's an easy job? No kidding!

*楽な仕事だと？冗談じゃない！*

On the surface, she may look like any other little girl, but she is the biggest monster in this village!

*表面はその辺の小娘と同じ様な雰囲気を装っているが、あれがこの村一番の化け物だ！*

The fact that there is no sign of the strongman at all makes it all the more eerie.

*強者の気配を一切感じさせない事が、より不気味だ。*

&nbsp;

And those eyes!

*それにあの目！*

Those ocean-like cobalt green eyes seemed to lead to the bottom of an unbelievably deep ocean.

*あの海の様なコバルトグリーンの瞳が、途轍もなく深い海の底へ繋がっている様だった。*

Just one glance with those eyes made me feel as if I was being looked into the depths of my soul.

*あの目で一瞥されただけで、魂の奥底まで見据えられた様な気分になった。*

&nbsp;

Like those endlessly deep eyes, I can't see the bottom of my daughter's head.

*その果て無く深い瞳の様に、娘の底が丸っきり見えないのだ。*

&nbsp;

And yet, those people...those who can't see things are very lucky.

*だと言うのにあの連中は…、物が見えない者は実に幸せだ。*

If you want to mess with that thing, it is much more likely to survive if you dive into the Queen Hydra's den and pick up some eggs!

*アレにちょっかいを掛けるぐらいなら、クイーンヒュドラの巣穴に潜って、卵でも採って来る方が格段に生存率が高い！*

Those guys who don't understand that are finished.

*それが判らないアイツらはもう終わりだ。*

The employer who directed it also has no future first.

*それを指示した雇い主にも、まず先は無い。*

&nbsp;

You go forward, but no. Going backwards ends. I'm still stuck. This is the tide.

*進むもダメ。後ろへ行っても終わる。やっぱり詰んでいる。こりゃもう潮だ。*

&nbsp;

If neither the front nor the back works, we have no choice but to go our separate ways.

*前も後ろも駄目なら、別の道を行くしか無ェわな。*

&nbsp;

Jules Nard opened the window in front of him, wrapped his slender body in his cloak, and left the Amcam House without a sound.

*ジュール・ナールは目の前の窓を開け、細身の体をマントで包ませ、音も無くアムカムハウスを後にした。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The drug they were going to use was a paralyzing poison.

*彼らが使おうとしていた薬は麻痺毒だった。*

They are the so-called muscle relaxants.

*いわゆる筋弛緩剤の類だ。*

It is a powerful drug, but it is also highly volatile, so if it were to be used outside, it would have to be applied directly to the face to have any effect.

*強力な薬だが揮発性も高く、外で使うとしたら直接顔にでも当てなければ殆ど効果は期待できない。*

&nbsp;

But indoors, the effect can be quite effective.

*だが、室内なら効果は十分に期待できる。*

With the size of this corridor, if a container of medicine is thrown at a person's feet and its contents scatter, a space with a radius of about one meter should be filled with the effects of the medicine for less than 30 seconds.

*この通路の広さなら、薬の容器を足元に投げ付けて中身を飛び散らせれば、半径1メートル程の空間が30秒弱、薬の効果で満たされる筈だ。*

Protecting the mouth with a damp towel would have prevented the drug, but not many people would have thought of that on the spur of the moment. A breath of air is all it takes.

*湿らせたタオルででも口元を保護すれば薬は防げるが、咄嗟にそんな事に思い至る者などそうは居ない。一息吸い込めば終わりなのだ。*

&nbsp;

Well, if by any chance the drugs were to be lost, it would only be a matter of threatening them with a knife.

*まあ、もし万が一薬が躱されたとしても、刃物で脅してやれば済む話だ。*

A daughter of a lord...a little girl from a good family...a little show of violence and it's over in a jiffy. It's an easy job.

*領主の娘…良い家の小娘など、ちょっとした暴力を示せば直ぐ片が付く。実に楽な仕事だ。*

The order was not to damage the body, so it would be quicker if the medicine would take care of the problem.

*傷物にするなとのオーダーだったので、薬でかたが付いてくれれば手っ取り早い。*

&nbsp;

They huddled in the corner of the aisle and peeked down the other side.

*彼ら二人は通路の角に身を寄せ、その向うの通路を覗った。*

The target's daughter was just on her way here with her maid.

*ちょうどターゲットの娘が、メイドと二人連れだって此方へ向かって来る所だった。*

The two men looked at each other, nodded, covered their mouths with masks, and tossed a container of pills at the target's feet.

*男達二人は目線を合わせ頷き、口元をマスクで覆い、ターゲットの足元へ薬の容器を投げ付けた。*

The distance to the target is less than 10 meters. He starts running at the same time as he throws the medicine bottle.

*ターゲットまでの距離は10メートルと無い。薬瓶を投げ付けたのと同時に走り出す。*

The container broke like a bullet at the target's feet, just as he wanted.

*容器は思い通りにターゲットの足元で弾ける様に割れた。*

A flood of colorless, odorless gas should appear and take effect almost instantly.

*無色無臭のガスが溢れ、ほぼ一瞬で効果が現れる筈だ。*

&nbsp;

The men run toward their respective targets, the daughter and the maid. When the drug takes effect and they fall into a coma, they intend to catch their bodies in order to prevent them from making a loud noise when they fall.

*男達はそれぞれのターゲット、娘とメイドに向かって走って行く。薬が効き昏倒した時に、倒れた拍子に大きな音を出させない為、その身体を受け止めるつもりなのだ。*

&nbsp;

But the drugs don't seem to be working on the targets.

*だが、ターゲット達に薬が効いている様子が無い。*

My daughter stops and looks down at the broken container at her feet, but her consciousness remains normal.

*娘は足を止め、足元で割れた容器に視線を落としているが意識は正常に保っている。*

&nbsp;

The two men were blindsided by the fact that the drug had no effect, but they immediately ran, pulled out knives from their waists, and held them out.

*薬の効果が現れなかった事に男二人は瞠目するが、直ぐ様走りながら腰のナイフを抜き、突き出した。*

Somewhere, there was a movement in the air that could not be detected from here, and it may have dissipated faster than the medicine took effect.

*どこか、此方からは分らない空気の動きがあり、薬が効果を出すより早く散ってしまったのかもしれない。*

If you can't stand up to a situation on the spur of the moment, you are not a professional.

*咄嗟の状況判断で立ち回れねばプロとは言えない。*

The men decided to use the simplest and most effective means of getting them to do what they said by violence.

*男達は暴力で言う事を聞かせると言う、最も単純で一番効果的な手段を使う事にしたのだ。*

&nbsp;

They ran low toward their respective targets.

*二人はそれぞれのターゲットに向かって、身を低くして走った。*

The man facing his daughter has a knife in his right hand and his left hand outstretched as he lunges forward to block her path.

*娘に向かった男は、右手にナイフを持ち、左手を広げ、娘の行く手を阻む様に突き進んで行く。*

He intends to hold her in place, cover her mouth with his hand, and then hold the knife to her throat.

*そのまま抱え込み、口元を手で覆い、ナイフを喉元へ突き付けるつもりなのだ。*

&nbsp;

Her legs kicked the floor, and just when it seemed she could reach her daughter, she raised her lowered left hand and felt the tips of her fingers touch her own right hand, which was holding the knife.

*脚が床を蹴り、そのまま娘に手が届くと思われた時、娘が下げていた左手を上げ、その指先がナイフを握る自分の右手に触れたように感じた。*

At that moment, the man's consciousness was blown away.

*その瞬間、男の意識が吹き飛ばされた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The man's body spun at super-speed like a top, slicing through the air.

*ギュルンと言う音を響かせ、男の身体がコマの様に超速回転をし空気を切り裂いた。*

Immediately afterward, a popping sound like something exploding echoed through the place.

*直後、パンという、何かが破裂した様な音がその場に響き渡る。*

&nbsp;

The man's right hand, which was holding the knife, was blown outward, and his body was dragged by his arm, which spun him around at high speed and sent him crashing into the wall.

*スージィに向かって来た男の、ナイフを握っていた右手が、大きく外へ弾かれる様に吹き飛ばされ、その勢いのまま腕に身体が引き摺られ、高速で回転し飛ばされ壁にブチ当ったのだ。*

&nbsp;

His right arm was bent into an insane shape, and his entire body resembled a squashed frog, clinging to the wall.

*右腕が非常識な形に曲がり、その全身は潰れたカエルの様になり壁にへばり付いていた。*

His face may have been crushed, but he barely seems to be alive.

*顔面は潰れたかもしれないが、辛うじて生きてはいる様だ。*

&nbsp;

Brittle! Nande? Why? Did you use your friendly finger like you do to Stefan, hmm?"

*「脆っ！？ナンデ？何でぇ？ステファンにしてる様に、フレンドリーフィンガー使ったの、にぃ？」*

&nbsp;

Susie tilted her head and said that this was indeed a puzzling situation.

*スージィが小首を傾げ、この有り様が実に不可解だと口にした。*

They think they are being cute, but the devastation is still the same.

*可愛く言っているつもりらしいが、その惨状は変わらない。*

&nbsp;

Miss ......, it is a mistake to equate those in Amkam with those outside."

*「お嬢様……、アムカムの者と、外の者とを同列に扱うのは間違いでございます」*

Really?" Oooooooo ......, yeah, right, ......?"

*「そうなの？ぅーん……、そうなの、ね……？」*

&nbsp;

AnnaMarie tried to warn Susie, but Susie did not seem offended and kept tilting her head curiously.

*アンナメリーはスージィに諭す様に注意を促すが、スージィは悪びれた様子も無く、やはり不思議そうに小首を傾げたままだ。*

They are the ones who are at fault.

*悪いのはコイツ等だしねー　位にしか思っていない。*

There is no remorse, no pain, no remorse at all for the man who is slumped against the wall, exposed to the cruelty of the situation.

*壁にへばり付いて無残な姿を晒している男に対してなど、良心の呵責も痛みも何にも無い。*

The one who had originally attacked AnnaMarie, not to mention himself, with unpleasant and harmful intentions.

*元より、自分はおろかアンナメリーにまで不快な害意を向けながら襲って来た輩だ。*

There is no reason to go easy on them.

*優しく手加減をしてやる理由など、在る筈も無い。*

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, the man who went to AnnaMarie was trampled under her feet.

*一方、アンナメリーに向かった男は、彼女の足に踏み敷かれて居た。*

The man at his feet has his right arm, which should have been holding a knife, bent as if it had another joint from the second arm, and is being pushed and stomped on his back by AnnaMarie's foot.

*足元の男は、ナイフを握っていた筈の右腕が、二の腕からもう一つ関節が出来た様に曲がり、アンナメリーの足で背中に押し付けられ踏み付けられている。*

Pressed face down on the floor, his face is white-eyed and bubbling, and he seems to have long since given up consciousness.

*うつ伏せで床に押し付けられたその顔は、白目を剥いて泡を吹き、意識はとうに手放している様だ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The paralytic poison that was sprayed has already volatilized and lost its toxicity.

*散布された麻痺毒は、既に揮発して毒性は失われている。*

Suzy was aware that some kind of poison had been sprayed, but before she was aware of it, her body had already resisted the poison.

*スージィは何らかの毒が散布された事は気付いたが、その事を意識する前に、既に身体は毒をレジストしていた。*

There is no way that a poison of this low level would have any effect on Susie's body.

*この程度の低位の毒が、スージィの身体に作用を及ぼす故も無いのだ。*

&nbsp;

Furthermore, AnnaMarie was also nearby, but there was no indication that the poison had worked on her either.

*更にアンナメリーも近くに居たのだが、彼女にも毒が作用した様子は無い。*

&nbsp;

AnnaMary. I'm sure the poison was sprayed on ......, but are you ok, are you ok?

*「アンナメリー。毒が撒かれたはずだけど……、貴女は大丈夫、なの？！」*

Thank you for your concern, Miss. But there is no need to worry. I have been trained from an early age to be resistant to all poisons, so a paralyzing poison of this magnitude would have no effect on me.

*「お気遣いありがとうございます、お嬢様。しかしご心配には及びません。私、幼少の頃よりあらゆる毒に耐性を持つよう訓練されておりますので、この程度の麻痺毒など、効果の出ようが御座いません」*

"...... Oh, yes, I see."

*「……あ、そ、そうです、か」*

&nbsp;

I asked him about it, thinking that perhaps he was taking some kind of action, but I felt like he casually said something great.

*恐らく、何らかの対処を取っていたのだろうと思い聞いてみたが、なんだか、さり気無く凄い事言われた気がする。*

It's amazing that you can so easily figure out that it was a paralyzing poison. ...... What kind of early childhood education do they have? What about the Byros family?

*サラリとあれが麻痺毒だったと分ってしまうのも凄いけど……。どういう幼児教育をして居るのでしょうか？バイロス家は？！*

What on earth are you going to raise?

*一体何を育てるつもりなの？！*

Suzy's cheeks twitched at the thought.

*などと考え、頬が引き攣るスージィだった。*

&nbsp;

As I was thinking about this, AnnaMarie clapped her hands in a pompous manner.

*そんな事を考えていると、アンナメリーがポンポンと手を叩いた。*

&nbsp;

I have just instructed you to clean up this mess. I'm sorry to have wasted your time, but, miss, let's hurry up and head to your room."

*「今、この汚物を片付けるよう指示を出しました。つい無駄な手間を取られてしまいましたが、お嬢様、急いでお部屋へ向かいましょう」*

&nbsp;

While AnnaMarie was saying these words to Susie, several maids gathered there without a sound.

*アンナメリーがスージィにそんな言葉をかけている間に、数人のメイドが音も無くその場へ集まって来た。*

AnnaMarie waved her hand at the men, and the maids took them out in a fluid motion and began cleaning up the dirty floors and walls.

*そのままアンナメリーが男達へ向けフワリと手を振ると、メイド達は流れる様な作業で男達を連れ出し、汚れた床や壁を綺麗に片づけ清掃を始めた。*

&nbsp;

Now, my dear lady, let's leave the matter to these girls. We must hurry as quickly as possible."

*「さあ、お嬢様、此処はこの娘達に任せてまいりましょう。出来るだけ急ぎませんと」*

......Yes, AnnaMarie, hurry up, let's hurry up and get ready! Hurry up and get ready!

*「……ええ、アンナメリー、急ぎま、しょう。急いで支度を、整えるの、です！！」*

You can be sure that these girls will know what these people are up to and who is behind it. Don't worry, they will do a good job, you can rest assured. ...... Well, it's obvious who's behind it, but we need testimonies. ......

*「この者達の目的や黒幕は、この子達に任せておけば間違いありません。大丈夫です、この子達は良い仕事を致しますからね、安心ですよ……。まぁ背後に誰がいるかなど分り切った事ですが、証言は必要ですからね……ぅふふふ」*

"......, or ............."

*「……あ、さ、左様です、か…………」*

&nbsp;

Suzy, slightly twitching at AnnaMarie's thin smile, took her up and walked briskly to her room at the Amcam House.

*スージィは、アンナメリーの薄い笑いに若干引き攣りつつも、彼女を連れ立ち、足早にアムカムハウスの自室へと向かって行った。*

&nbsp;
