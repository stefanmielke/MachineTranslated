# 44 The Rite of Amcam Growth

## 44話　アムカム成長の儀式

Oh, it glowed.

*「…あ、光った」*

&nbsp;

In the dimly lit room of the magic wing, Dana holds out her hand, and the five seminal plates emit a pale light.

*ほの暗い魔法棟の室内で、ダーナが手を翳す五精盤が淡い光を放つ。*

Green and blue. The imprint of the parts that governed wind and earth shone softly.

*緑と青。風と土を司る部位の刻印が柔らかな光を放った。*

&nbsp;

"I can't believe the vanguard responds to multiple attributes: ......"

*「前衛が複数の属性に反応するなんて……」*

&nbsp;

Colin raised his glasses with a snap, the frames glinting as he muttered.

*コリンがメガネをクイッと上げ、フレームをキラリと光らせながら呟いた。*

&nbsp;

Originally, it is not possible for a genuine vanguard to show aptitude for more than one spirit.

*元来、生粋の前衛職が複数の精霊へ対し適性を示す事は、まずあり得無い事なのだそうだ。*

That's why two people responded to multiple attributes in a row today.

*それが今日は二人も立て続けに複数属性に反応した。*

Irving also nanted before this! He was reacting to the three attributes of fire, wind and nothingness!

*アーヴィンもこの前にナント！火と風と無の三つの属性に反応していたのだ！！*

&nbsp;

Impossible..." Bibi and Mia rolled their eyes and stared at Irving.

*ありえない…　と、ビビとミアが目を丸くしてアーヴィンを見詰めてた。*

&nbsp;

Is this it? Could it be that the focus on running and kata practice went better than expected? Either way, this means that Dana no longer has to worry about the entrance exam coming up next month!

*これはアレかな？思った以上に走り込みでの集中と、型稽古が上手く行ったって事かしらん？どちらにしても、コレでダーナは来月に迫る入試への不安が無くなったと云う事だ！*

Duh! Good, good!

*ウン！良かった、良かった！！*

&nbsp;

Sue! Thanks! I owe it all to Sue!!!!"

*「スー！ありがとー！スーのおかげだよー！！」*

Mew-mew-mew!"

*「みゅぎゅむっ！」*

&nbsp;

Dana hugged me as hard as she could.

*ダーナに思い切り抱き付かれた。*

My face is buried in its more than enough elastic bosom.

*その十二分に弾力に富む胸元に顔が埋まるるぅ。*

This is quite shiawase.

*コレはこれで結構シアワセー。*

&nbsp;

I'm glad to hear that, Dana. I'm relieved, too.

*「良かったダーナ。わたしも安心した、よ？」*

&nbsp;

I looked up while buried in the comfortable chest and answered Dana with a big smile on my face, too.

*心地良い胸元に埋まりながらも顔を上げて、わたしも満面の笑みでダーナに答えた。*

Then, Dana, who was looking down at me, put more effort into it with a tinge in her cheeks.

*すると、わたしを見降ろすダーナが、頬を染めながら更に力を籠めて。*

&nbsp;

Oh, God! Already! Sue is too cute!"

*「あーー！もう！スーが可愛過ぎるーーー！」*

&nbsp;

He was petting the dog and stroking it!

*と叫び、ワシャワシャとアッチコッチを撫でまわしてくりゅ！*

No, not on the sides! Oh, and the buttocks, too!

*わ、脇はダメにょぉぉ！お、お尻もぉぉ！*

&nbsp;

I was writhing and enduring Dana's attack, when I felt a piercing look from behind me!　As I twisted and turned to withstand Dana's attack, I felt a piercing look from behind me.

*ふにゃぁぁあ！　と身を捩らせダーナの攻撃に耐えていると、後ろから刺す様な視線を感じた。*

If you turn your attention in that direction, you will see Mia looking at you with her hands flailing, as if she is aiming at her prey!

*其方に意識を向ければ、ミアが両手をワキワキさせながら獲物を狙う様な眼でコチラを視てる？！*

Mia? Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you breathing so hard? What are you doing with your hands? What are you doing?

*ミ、ミア？！何でそんな目で見てるにょ？！鼻息が荒いよ？！その手はナニ？何をするつもりにゃのぉーーっっ？！！*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Speaking of which, Sue. The day after tomorrow, right? I wonder if you've finished getting ready?"

*「そう言えばスー。もう明後日でしょ？準備は終わったのかしら？」*

&nbsp;

When Dana caught me and I was shivering with the aura that Mia exudes, Colin brought up the subject as if to offer a helping hand.

*わたしがダーナに捕まり、ミアの醸し出すオーラに戦慄しているところへ、コリンが助け舟を出す様に話題を振ってくれた。*

&nbsp;

I received the sword and the leather armor yesterday after they were adjusted! Yesterday, I received the sword and the leather armor... after they were adjusted! ...and I'm here... now!

*「うン！昨日、剣と革鎧の…調整が終わって、受け取ってン！…来た…か、ら！」*

&nbsp;

I answered Colin as I escaped from Dana's arms.

*ダーナの腕から逃れながらコリンに答えた。*

&nbsp;

We were already prepared for the encampment except for the swords and leather armor, so most of the preparations were ready when we received them yesterday.

*剣と革鎧以外の野営の準備はもう出来ていたので、昨日の受け取りで大方の準備は整ったのだ。*

&nbsp;

I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about! You have nothing to worry about.

*「まっ！アンタなら何の心配も無いけどっ、頑張んなさいよっ！」*

Thanks Bibi! I'll do my best, okay?

*「ありがとビビ！わたし頑張る、ね！」*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The "Amkham Coming of Age Ceremony" is a time-honored tradition for Amkham children to become independent at the age of 14.

*『アムカム成人の儀』それはアムカムの子供達が14歳になった時に行う、昔から続く独り立ちの為の習わしだ。*

&nbsp;

It's not hard to do.

*やる事は難しい事じゃ無い。*

All you have to do is go into the Amcam forest for a week and then come back alive.

*一週間、アムカムの森に入り、そして生きて帰って来れば良いだけだ。*

This is a custom that has continued in this area for hundreds of years, and in the original world, it would be like the Genpuku ceremony.

*これは何百年もこの地域で続いて来た慣習で、元の世界で言えば元服式の様な物かな？*

&nbsp;

In the old days, children who entered the forest risked their lives.

*大昔はそれこそ森へ入った子供は命がけだった。*

Not all children made it back safely.

*全ての子供が無事に帰って来れた訳では無い。*

There were many children who could not come back.

*帰って来れない子供達も数多く居たそうだ。*

That is why, before entering the forest, the children were given metal tags so that they could be identified in case of emergency.

*だから森へ入る前に子供には、予め金属製のタグを持たせ、もしもの時でも身元が判る様にしていたのだそうだ。*

It is a simple metal plate with no particular magic power inside, just a name, date of birth, and the name of the village from which he was born.

*それは特に魔力が籠められている訳でも無い、名前、生年月日、そして出身の村名だけが刻まれてる只の金属の板。*

It's just a piece of metal to identify the person.

*本人を判別する為だけの金属片だ。*

&nbsp;

When they return to the village after a successful week, they are recognized as a full-fledged person for the first time there.

*一週間を無事に過ごして村へ戻った時、そこで初めて一人前と認められる。*

Tag is that one villager...in those days, it was Amkam territory.

*タグはその一人前の村人…当時で言えばアムカム領だね。*

It is also a sign that you have officially become a resident of this Amcam.

*正式に此処アムカムの住人になった証でもあるのだ。*

&nbsp;

I think it was a very hard habit of the people who lived with the forest of Amkamu, where the magical beasts lived.

*魔獣が住まうアムカムの森と共に生きる人々の、なんともハードな習わしだったのだと思うよ。*

&nbsp;

Nowadays, there are safety measures in place, and it is rare for a child to not be able to return home.

*現代では、シッカリとした安全策も施され、帰って来れない子供はまず居ない。*

The members of the Protectorate are guarding us without being attached to us.

*付かず離れずで護民団の団員の方達がガードしてくれてるからね。*

Now it is just a convention, but it is still a week of survival living alone in the woods.

*今では只の慣習でしかないのだけれど、それでも一週間、森の中で一人サバイバル生活をする事には変わりがない。*

&nbsp;

Even today, bringing home a tag is a sign that a child has become a full-fledged member of the family.

*現代でもやっぱりタグを持って帰って来る事は、子供達にとって一人前になったと言う証でもあるわけです。*

&nbsp;

For me, having a tag means that I have become a true resident of the village.

*わたしにとってもタグを持てると云う事は、本当の意味で村の住人になれたと云う証にも感じる。*

So I'm really looking forward to that time, and I'm really looking forward to it!

*だから、その時がとても楽しみで、ものスッゴい心待ちにしてるのだ！*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What happened to everyone else?"

*「みんなの時は、どうだった、の？」*

&nbsp;

I got a little excited thinking about the day after tomorrow and wanted to hear from someone who has been there.

*明後日の事を考えたらちょっとテンション上がって来て、経験者の話を聞いてみたくなってしまった。*

&nbsp;

I...didn't do much of anything, I guess..."

*「オレは…特に大した事はしなかったかな…」*

&nbsp;

Irving began to speak as he recalled with his right hand lightly on his chin.

*アーヴィンが顎に右手を軽く添えて思い出す様に話し始めた。*

Irving's birthday is in the red month of 5, so he's done in early fall.

*アーヴィンの誕生日は5の紅月だから秋口に済んじゃったのよね。*

&nbsp;

I've been thrown into the woods by my father every so often since I was a kid of about five. I usually lived on my own for 10 or 20 days...and then I'd be out there for a week or so, and I'd feel like it was a new thing.

*「大体オレは五つ位のガキの頃から、しょっちゅう父さんに森の中に放り込まれてたからな。普通に10日や20日は独りで生きてたし…一週間位、今更って感じだったなぁ」*

&nbsp;

My brothers said it was similar,?　said Dr. Irving.

*兄貴達も似た様なもんだったって言ってたぞ？　と、アーヴィン先生は仰っている。*

Oh, I was talking about people who shouldn't be referred to here.

*あ、コレ参考にしちゃイケナイ人の話だった。*

&nbsp;

What are you doing? What are you making me do, Haggard family? Mr. Harry!

*何やってんの？何やらせてんのよハッガード家！ハリーさん！！*

What if something happens to your children?

*お子さん達にもしもの事があったらどうすんのよ？！*

What will you do if you don't come back? How Spartan can you be?

*帰って来れなかったらどうしちゃうのよ？！！スパルタにも程があるよ？！*

Oh...but Harry, you are the "Golden Lion", right?

*あ…、でもハリーさんってば『金獅子』だったよね？*

The lion pushes his cub down into the valley of a thousand questions? Like a lion pushing his cub into the forest?

*獅子は我が子を千尋の谷へ突き落とす的な？敢えて森の中へ突き放す的な？！*

But usually you can't! Because you'll die!

*でも普通は無理だから！死んじゃうから！！*

And yet Irving is pretty funny too, talking about it with a nonchalant face, you know?

*それなのに平気な顔で話してるアーヴィンも結構おかしいよ？！*

It's already scary, the Haggard family!

*もうコワイよハッガード家！*

Is this how the boys of Amkam's heroic family grow up?

*こうやってアムカムの英雄一家の男子が育って行くってお話しなのっ？！*

&nbsp;

"Da, how was Dana?"

*「ダ、ダーナはどうだった、の？」*

&nbsp;

Let's put aside for the moment the opinions of people who are not helpful, and seek fruitful stories.

*参考にならない人の意見は取敢えず横に置いて、実のあるお話を求めよう。*

I think the right thing to do is to ask the experienced upperclassmen here.

*取敢えず、此処に居る経験済みの上級生に聞いてみるのが正解なのだと思う。*

&nbsp;

I just kept on hunting horned rabbits!

*「あたしは只ひたすら角兎を狩り続けてたな！」*

&nbsp;

Hmm?

*ん？*

&nbsp;

'The number of birds I hunted in a week, 43 in all! Isn't that great? I don't think this record is going to be broken anytime soon!

*「一週間で狩った数、全部で43羽！凄いだろ？！この記録はチョットやそっとじゃ抜かれないと思うんだ！！」*

&nbsp;

Huh? Well.... Oh, by the way! A horned rabbit is a beast that lives in the shallows of the forest, not a demonic beast. Since it is not a magical beast, its meat can be eaten normally.

*あれ？えーと…。あ、因みに！角兎って言うのは森の浅層に生息する獣で、魔獣では無い。魔獣では無いので、その肉は普通に食べられる。*

Its appearance is that of a large rabbit with antlers like a deer. Its meat is quite tasty, and its fur is versatile and can be used in many ways.

*その姿は鹿の様な角を持つ大きな兎だ。肉も結構美味しいし、毛皮も汎用性高く色々と使える。*

Moreover, the quality of Amkham products is better than that of other places, and they are one of Amkham's specialties.

*しかもアムカム産の物は余所のモノより質も良いと云う事で、アムカム特産品の一つでもある。*

Even children can hunt safely, so they are exclusively useful as good pocket money earners for the children of AMCAM...but...!

*子供でも安全に狩れるので、アムカムの子供達の良い小遣い銭稼ぎとしてもっぱら役に立っているのだ…が！*

They are not easy to hunt, as they are very alert and extremely fast.

*警戒心もかなり高く素早さも尋常では無いので、簡単に狩れる物では無いのだ。*

I often hear stories of people spending an entire day with zero results.

*丸一日かけても成果ゼロとか言う話も良く耳にする。*

&nbsp;

Well, since they can be such a hard catch, I can get a good price for them and get some extra money in my pocket!

*ま、そんな捕まえ難いって事もあるので、良い値で買い取って貰えてお小遣いにもなるんだけどね！*

&nbsp;

And Dana continued to hunt such hard-to-capture horned rabbits at an average rate of five to six a day?

*で、ダーナはそんな捕獲し辛い角兎を、一日平均5～６羽のペースで狩り続けたって？*

You know, hunting five horned rabbits in one day is impossible for normal kids, right? That's an unusual number, you know?

*一日に角兎５羽狩るとか、普通の子供達には無理だからね？それ尋常じゃ無い数だからね？！*

&nbsp;

I'm not going to be able to hunt in the woods for a week! I've never had the opportunity to hunt in the woods for a week! I was crazy about setting a record!"

*「もうさ！一週間も森に籠って狩りをさせて貰えるなんて機会無いからさ！夢中で記録に挑んじゃったよ！！」*

&nbsp;

Dana smiles proudly, "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Yes, I knew I was a bad person too.

*あははははー　と自慢げに笑うダーナ。ウン、やっぱりコチラもダメな人だった。*

&nbsp;

This ritual was originally intended to test the life force and survival skills of a single person in the harsh Amkamu forest.

*本来この儀式は過酷なアムカムの森で、一人でも生き残れる生命力とサバイバル能力を試す為のモノなのだ。*

And yet, Dana had abandoned the original purpose of the ordeal, chasing around the horned rabbits, which are even more difficult to hunt, and became obsessed with increasing her score....

*なのにダーナってばその試練本来の目的をブッチ切り、只でさえ狩り辛い角兎を追い回し、ひたすらスコアを伸ばす事に夢中になったとか…。*

No, no, no, this person! She was the kind of older sister that juniors should not emulate!

*駄目ですワこの人！後輩が見習ってはイケナイお姉さんの人でしたよ？！！*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Oooh, now I'm well aware that Irving and Dana are fellow brainiacs!

*ウン、今更だけどアーヴィンとダーナが同じ脳筋仲間だと良く分ったよ！*

So, Fiorina! Don't nod your head in admiration like that! You know what? You see the look of dismay on Carl's face? These two are out of character, okay? Don't imitate them! Don't imitate them! Let's learn from normal people!

*だからフィオリーナ！そんな感心した様に頷いちゃダメ！ホラ！カールも呆れた顔してるでしょ？！この二人は規格から外れてるからね？真似しちゃダメ！ゼッタイ！！ちゃんと普通の人を見習おうね！！*

&nbsp;

I looked around in dismay at the two of them, and my eyes met Bibi's. Bibi cowered her shoulders, let out a sigh, and shook her head.

*そんな二人に呆れて視線を巡らせると、ビビと目が合った。ビビは肩を竦めて溜息を吐き、首を振る。*

Oooh, the feelings are synchronized. These two are no good, right?

*ウン、気持ちがシンクロしたね。この二人はダメだよね？*

I looked at Colin with a fearful gaze in anticipation... Colin would be fine, right?

*ンで、そのまま期待を込めて、恐る恐る視線をコリンに向けてみる…コリンならダイジョブよね？*

&nbsp;

Well, did I start by finding a safe place to camp?"

*「そうね、私は最初に安全な野営場所を探す所から始めたかしら？」*

&nbsp;

Oh! This is it! That's a normal and obvious answer! This is what I was looking for! This is what I was looking for!

*ををぅ！コレですよコレ！ちゃんと普通に当たり前のお答えだ！求めていたのはこう云うヤツですよ！こういうヤツぅ！！*

Quintessential honor student, Sister Colin! I love you, too!

*流石優等生のコリンお姉様！！も、だいしゅき！！*

&nbsp;

Unh! Unh! So? So?

*「ウン！ウン！！それで？それで？！」*

&nbsp;

Zzzz! and urged Colin to approach and proceed.

*ズズイッ！とコリンに近付いて話を進める様に促した。*

&nbsp;

It's a good thing I practiced setting up the tent before I went out, because I would have lost a whole day if I hadn't been used to it. If I hadn't been used to it, I would have lost a whole day. I could get my own water, so that wasn't a problem, but I did have to be careful about getting and keeping a fire going.

*「テントは事前に練習して自分一人で張れる様にして於いて良かったわよ。慣れて無ければ間違い無く丸一日潰れてたもの。水は自分で出せるから問題無かったけど、火種の確保と維持には気を使ったわね」*

&nbsp;

I knew it was quintessential! Bibi and I nodded our heads and listened to Colin's story.

*やっぱり流石だよね！ビビと二人で頷きながらコリンの話に聞き入った。*

Well, Bibi will have his "coming of age ceremony" the month after next! I'm sure I'll listen to what these well-informed people have to say!

*ウン、再来月はビビも『成人の儀』だものね！こういうシッカリした人のお話は耳を傾けちゃうよね！！*

It is instructive to hear stories like this that can only be told by someone who has been there.

*こういう経験者だからこそ語れる話って言うのは勉強になる。*

What was good? What went wrong? This is what I wanted to hear!

*何が良かったのか？何が失敗だったのか？こう云うのが聞きたかったワケですよ！*

&nbsp;

Oh, by the way, where's the other experienced person? I looked around and saw Mia looking at me with a "welcome anytime" look on her face.

*あ、そう言えばもう一人の経験者は？と視線を巡らせると、ミアがいつでもウエルカムって顔でこっちを見てる。*

&nbsp;

Oh, um... how was Mia?"

*「あ、えーと…ミアは、どうだった、の？」*

&nbsp;

As soon as I asked him, "What do you mean? He looked so happy and started talking about it.

*と、訊ねた途端、我が意を得たり！とばかりに、それはそれは嬉しそうな顔して語り始めた。*

&nbsp;

I was 6 Sougetsu, wasn't I? I was 6 in the blue moon, right? It was already snowing, so I thought it would be hard to stay in the tent, so I enclosed the tent with plants.

*「ホラ！わたしって6の蒼月だったでしょ？雪も、もう積もってたからテントで過ごすのも大変だと思って、植物を使ってテントを囲ったの」*

&nbsp;

According to Mia, a small dome-like wind shelter was created by extending tree branches around the tent and by magically binding the ivy together.

*ミアに話では、テントの周りに樹の枝を伸ばしたり、蔦を魔力で纏める事で小さなドーム状の風除けを作ったらしい。*

The snow piled up there and made it look like a little hut, in which the people sheltered from the cold.

*そこに雪が積もって行って、ちょっとしたかまくらの様になり、その中で寒さを凌いだそうだ。*

&nbsp;

The snow and wind were cold, and I had to make the fire myself, so it was very hard work!

*「もうね、雪風も冷たいしね、火も自分で起こさないとイケナイからね、スッゴイ大変だったんだよ！」*

&nbsp;

Yes, these "trials" change in difficulty depending on the season and weather.

*そうなんだよね、この『試練』って季節や天候によって難易度が変わってしまう。*

It's supposed to be a week from the birthday, so there's no postponement or advance due to bad weather.

*誕生日から一週間と言う決め事になっているから、天候不良で延期とか前倒しとかは無い。*

There have been instances where the schedule has been moved up, but there is no change in the schedule due to weather conditions.

*前倒しになる例もあるけれど、天候によっての日程の変更は無いのだ。*

So, while some children, like Mia, have to have their sessions in the cold season, others, like me and Bibi, have to have them in a more comfortable season.

*だから、ミアの様に寒い時期で行わないといけない子も居れば、わたしやビビの様に過ごし易い季節に行われる子も居る。*

But even if the season is good, you will have a hard time when a storm comes and the weather is stormy.

*でも季節が良いからと言っても、嵐とか来られて天候が荒れた日にゃ大変な目に逢う。*

It's also the season when wild animals become more active! Either way, we must not let our guard down.

*野生動物の活動も活発になる季節だしね！どっちにしても油断してはいけないのだ。*

&nbsp;

But we had enough food for a week, a tent and sleeping bag to keep us warm, and we were allowed to use the magical equipment to heat the house," he said. We were also allowed to use the magical equipment for heating, so we made it work."

*「でも食料は一週間分持たせて貰ったし、防寒のテントと寝袋。後、暖房の魔道具も使わせて貰えたから何とかなったよ」*

&nbsp;

The inexperienced children are relieved when Mia explains that

*というミアの説明に未経験の子達は安堵する。*

Yes, a child in a difficult situation like this can get food and other follow-up services.

*そうなのだ、こういう風に状況の厳しい子は食料などのフォローをして貰えるのだ。*

It's tough to be self-sufficient in food in the winter!

*冬場での食料の自給は厳しいからね！*

On the other hand, those of us in more comfortable seasons have to make do with food on our own.

*逆に過ごし易い季節のわたし達は、食糧は自力で何とかしなくてはならない。*

Well, that's why Dana and Irvin were able to hunt and fend for themselves with impunity!

*ま、ダーナやアーヴィンは平気で狩りして自活してた訳だけどね！*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But still, I had to endure the cold for a week.... Oh, the cold came back when I remembered! My body needs some warmth, don't you know?

*「それでもやっぱり、一週間寒さに耐え続けたよ…。あ、思い出したら寒さがぶり返して来た！身体が温もりを欲しているよ？！」*

"...! Fumyunpu?

*「…！ふにゅンぷっ？！」*

&nbsp;

Just as I thought I had said that, Mia hugged me from the front! My face was buried in Mia's large mass!

*そう言ったかと思うとミアが正面から抱き付いて来た！わたしの顔が、ミアの大ぶりな塊に埋もれてしまうぅぅ！！*

&nbsp;

Oh, it's warm...it's warm, Sue-chan."

*「あぁ、温い…温いよぉスーちぁゃん」*

&nbsp;

This, this! Mia's signature depraved meat hold!

*こ、これは！ミアお得意の堕肉ホールド！！*

It's a meat trap that exploits my habit of getting buried in this comfortable space and not being able to leave!

*この心地良い狭間に埋もれてしまうと離れられ無くなる、わたしの習性を突く肉の罠だ！*

Mia's hands were stroking his motionless body in every direction!

*その動けぬ身体をミアの手が好き勝手、縦横無尽に撫で回して来りゅりゅ！！*

&nbsp;

Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah..." Apu-nnnn! Meow! Sho, Shoko..! Don't stroke me...! Nnnnggg!

*「あ…あにゅ！あぷゅンんんーーっ！！にゃぁ！！しょ、しょこ…！撫でちゃ…っっ！ンっ！！」*

I'm warm....Soo-chan warm...! It's warm...soo warm...! And... soft..."

*「はン！温いよぉ…スーちゃん温い…ぃん！そして…柔らかぁ♪」*

&nbsp;

Mia's hands were caressing my back, armpits, and waist! And even her buttocks were being caressed with her hands!

*ミ、ミアの手が…背中や脇や腰を撫で回しゅ！更にわお尻まで両手でワキワキ、とっ！*

Ah! Was this what you were aiming for?

*ああ！さっきワキワキしてたのはコレを狙ってたにょかっ？！*

&nbsp;

Even though she was doing this to me, I didn't take my face away from between the pincers, and I was puffing and puffing on the corrupt flesh with both of my hands!

*こんなんされてても、わたしは顔を挟間から離さず、剰え両手で堕肉をパッフンパッフンやってる始末っっ！！！*

Ah! What a depth of my own karma?

*ああ！何という我が身の業の深さかっ？！*

Fearless! Fallen meat hold!

*恐るべし！堕肉ホールド！！*

But, but..! While we're at it, Mia's attackers will invade further! That's..! There! Don't reach for it! No!

*だがしかしっ！そんな事してる間に、ミアの攻め手が更なる侵攻をぉぉ！！そ！ソコに！ゆ、指を伸ばすのは！禁止ぃぃぃぃぃーーっ！！*

&nbsp;

I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Meow! Nyuhhhhhhhh!"

*「はぅン！にゃっ！にゅにゅうぅぅーーーっんんんんン！」*

&nbsp;

And today, my embarrassing voice echoed in the room like a punch line again.

*そして今日もまたオチの様に、わたしの恥ずかしい声が室内に響いてしまうのだった。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

----------------

Irving and the boys, who were gawking at Sue-chan, who was writhing around cutely, were kicked in the butt by Bibi and kicked out of the room!

*可愛く身を捩りまくってるスーちゃんをガン見していたアーヴィン達男子勢は、ビビちゃんにお尻を蹴り飛ばされて、部屋から追い出されたとさ！*

And by the way...it was my turn at the end! Willie, who was breathing hard, was kicked out with him, and he realized that he had been airborne. Chan chan...

*ついでに…最後は自分の番だ！と息を巻いていたウィリーも一緒に蹴り出され、自分が空気だった事を自覚したのでした。チャンチャン♪*

Next "Dinner at the Cloud Family's

*次回「クラウド家の夕餉」*
