# 11 Epilogue Suzy is in a great hurry

## 11話　エピローグ　スージィ大いに慌てる

This is an introductory chapter epilogue. It is short ^^^;

*序章エピローグです。短いです＾＾；*


----------------

&nbsp;

I'm hungry. ......"

*「お腹減ったなぁ……」*

&nbsp;

I can't help but spill my heart out.

*つい心情が零れてしまう。*

&nbsp;

Now they were moving forward with their backs against the hollow where the orc settlement had been.

*今は、オーク集落のあった窪地を背にして進んでいた。*

They are heading west to cleanse themselves in the river.

*川で身体を清めようと西に向かっているのだ。*

&nbsp;

In case you are wondering, I put on my underwear just now.

*因みに、先ほど下着は付けた。*

&nbsp;

He seemed a little remorseful for having inadvertently lured the orc by releasing the scent of a woman.

*不用意に女の匂いを放って、オークを誘い込んだ事に少しばかり反省した様だ。*

&nbsp;

'And yet, Coco is not another 10 km from the edge of the forest, is it? ...... It's not good to have such a dangerous colony this far from human habitation, is it? Maybe we should ...... look around the area a little more before we go out to the human settlement. ......

*「それにしても、ココって森の端からもう10キロ無いよな……。人里からこの程度の距離にこんな危険なコロニーがあるってヤバくね？……もう少し、この近辺見回ってから人里へ出た方が良いかもね……」*

&nbsp;

He seems to have started thinking up some sort of excuse.

*なにやら、言い訳じみた事を考え始めた様だ。*

&nbsp;

Yeah, but food security is a depressing problem. ...... Speaking of which, those filthy creatures were handled very well. ...... I didn't know what kind of animal it was, but it looked like deer, boar, ...... and some fish. ...... No, I don't want it! I don't want it! I would never eat anything made by the hands of filth! ......? Wait a minute! A fish? There's fish! If it's fish, you don't have to take it apart, do you? That's right! Why didn't I notice that before? If it's fish, we can just grill it! Oh my God! Why didn't I notice that before? Am I an idiot? I'm so stupid! I've got to get to the river! Let's get some fish! River fish! I might need some salt, but I'm fine without it! Fish! It's a grilled fish party! Yee-hoo!

*「あぁ、でも食糧確保は憂鬱な問題だよなぁ……。そ言えばあの汚物共は上手いコト捌いてたな……。何の動物かはよく分んなかったけど、なんか鹿っぽかったり猪ぽかったり……魚もあったな……いや！いらないけどね！汚物の手による物なんか絶対に食わないけどさっ！……ン？イヤまてっ！？サカナっ？！魚があったか！魚なら解体しなくて良いんじゃね！？そうだよ！なんで今まで気が付かなかった？魚ならそのまま焼けば良いんじゃん！なんてこったい！ずっと水辺で過ごしてたのに何故今まで気付かない？！オレってマヌケ？！大マヌケ！！川に急がねば！！魚採るぞ！川魚だ！塩が欲しいかもだけどそのままでもイイや！サカナだっ！焼き魚パーティーだっっ！イヤッフゥッ！！」*

&nbsp;

When he ran out of the house with an unintentional sense of joy,......, he raised his right arm instantly and turned the sword he was holding to his back. I instantly lifted my right arm, put the sword I was holding behind my back, and with a clang, I slashed at something that flew by at high speed.

*思わず喜び勇んで走り出そうした時……。瞬時に右腕を上げ、握っていた剣を背中側へ廻し、ガキンッと高速で飛来した何かを剣で斬り弾いた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"Yeah, again?"

*「うえぇまたぁ？」*

&nbsp;

It was "Bread Beetle.

*『ブレッドビートル』だった。*

&nbsp;

Why are you coming back?

*「何で又来んねん！？」*

&nbsp;

The fake Kansai dialect stinks.

*エセ関西弁が胡散臭い。*

&nbsp;

"Are you trying to get back at me for yesterday?　What kind of a drug dealer brings his friends to pay a visit?　How dare you find me?　You're a stalker!　Girls don't like you!　Wow, this is over 500, isn't it?

*「まっさか昨日の仕返しって事？　仲間連れてお礼参りとかどこのヤク〇屋さんよっ！？　よくまぁ見つけて来たなっ！？　ストーカーかっ！　女の子に嫌われるからねっっ！？　うわぁコレ500超えてね？」*

&nbsp;

With a cry that could neither be described as a complaint nor a scream, they cut down the flying Beetles one after another.

*そんな愚痴とも悲鳴ともつかない叫びを上げながら、次々と飛来するビートルを斬り落として行った。*

&nbsp;

Breadbeetle's initial velocity exceeds 500 m/s.

*ブレッドビートルの初速は500m/sを上回る。*

A series of bursts above the speed of sound, and machine guns come flying in like scattering bullets.

*連続で音速を超えた破裂音を響かせ、マシンガンが弾丸をばら撒く様に飛来する。*

&nbsp;

The sword in the opposite hand makes a metallic sound, leaving an afterimage of the blade as it slashes and flicks one after another.

*それを逆手に持った剣でキンキンと金属音を響かせ、ブレードの残像を残しながら次々斬り弾く。*

&nbsp;

I've cut something boring again, and I don't mean ......!　There's no end to this!　I can't wait to go get some fish!　I can't wait to go get some fish!　I'll just use my skills and blow it ...... again."

*「またつまらぬ物を切ってしまっ……ぢゃなくてっ！　ホンットキリ無いわコレ！！！　早く魚取りに行きたいのにさっ！！　クッソ！　またスキルでブッ飛ばし……」*

&nbsp;

Nope. Wait ...... and stop thinking about it.

*いや。待て……と思いとどまる。*

&nbsp;

Coco is no more than 10 kilometers from a human village.

*もうココは人里から10キロと離れていない。*

What if I unleash my fancy skills in such a place and do a lot of damage to a wide area of forest?

*そんな場所で派手なスキルぶっ放し、広範囲の森林に大ダメージを与えたら？*

&nbsp;

The number of people there now is over 500, far more than yesterday.

*今居る数は、昨日より遥かに多い500超えだ。*

If all of them were to be eradicated at once, the power would be unmatched by yesterday.

*全部一度で殲滅するとなれば、威力は昨日の比では無い。*

&nbsp;

(Oh no!　I can't use it now!)

*（ヤヴァイ！！　今使う訳にはいかねぇ！！）*

&nbsp;

We are supposed to have just burned down an orc settlement earlier, but apparently orcs don't count.

*先ほど、オークの集落を焼き尽くして来たばかりの筈だが、オークはカウントに入れないらしい。*

&nbsp;

Oh, it's such a pain in the ass!　I have to drop everything!　What is this work?　Is this a pain in the ass?　...... Well, I'll do it!　I'll do it!　...... No?　Wait a minute. Why don't you just use this one?"

*「うぁーーっめんどくせっ！　全部落とさなきゃいけないのね！？　何この作業？　この苦行？　……まぁやりますけどさっ！　やりますけどねっ！！　……いや？　まてよ。コッチの使えば良いんじゃね？」*

&nbsp;

I still decided to use my skills.

*やはりスキルを使う事にした。*

&nbsp;

Waste, waste, waste!"

*「無駄無駄無駄ぁ！」*

&nbsp;

≪'The World of Fear'.

*≪ザ・ワールド・オブ・フィアー≫*

Enchantment Channeler Skills.

*エンチャントチャネラーのスキル。*

A skill that instills fear in enemies weaker than oneself over a wide area centered on oneself and causes them to flee.

*自分を中心に広範囲に渡り自分より弱い敵に恐怖を植え込み、逃げるように仕向けるスキル。*

&nbsp;

The air around me changed.

*周りの空気が変わった。*

I froze in an instant.

*一瞬で凍りついた。*

Fear quickly flooded out of Susie and spread over a wide area.

*恐怖が瞬く間にスージィから溢れ出し、広範囲に広がって行く。*

&nbsp;

The forest shook with a zap.

*ザワァっと森が揺れた。*

&nbsp;

The creatures, as they were called, began to flee from around Suzy as fast as they could.

*猛烈な勢いで生き物と云う生き物が、スージィの周りから全力で逃げ出し始めた。*

&nbsp;

Wahahahahahaha." Did you see that? Even I can do it! This is how we can resolve this problem peacefully! I have successfully repelled the enemy without destroying nature! Wahahahahaha h...... Oh, what is that? I'm not sure what to say! You're running away too fast, aren't you? You guys are running away too much, aren't you? What do you mean the mobs over 5 kilometers away are also running away? Whaaaat? It's not good! Oh no! It's overflowing! It's overflowing out of the forest! It's coming out!

*「わははははははははは！見たか！ワタシだってなぁ！こうやって平和的解決出来るんだよ！自然破壊も行わず見事敵を撃退して見せたぞっ！わはははははｈ……あ、あれ？ちょ、ちょっと！逃げすぎぢゃね！？逃げすぎでしょアンタらっ？！5キロ以上先のMobも逃げてるってどゆことぉーっ？！うぇえええ？！ヤッバイってぇ！！あひィィィ！溢れちゃう！森から溢れ出ちゃうぅぅ！！でちゃうよぉぉぉ！！！」*

&nbsp;

For some reason, the phrasing is obscene at the end, but I was in a great hurry.

*何故か最後の方で言い回しが卑猥になっているが、大慌てである。*

&nbsp;

If this continues, there will be a massive avalanche of Mob into human settlements.

*このままだと、人里へMobが大量に雪崩れ込む。*

It would be like having a little stampede.

*ちょっとしたスタンピードを起こした様になってしまう。*

There may even be casualties.

*犠牲者だって出るかもしれない。*

&nbsp;

It tastes bad!

*不味い！！*

&nbsp;

Suzy ran south as fast as she could in a panic to destroy all the mobs.

*スージィは大慌てでMobを殲滅し尽くすべく、南へ向かって全力で走り出した。*

&nbsp;

'Uhhhhhhhh!　SAKANAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

*「うひぃ～～～ん！　サカナァーーーっっ！」*

&nbsp;

I ran crying.

*泣きながら走った。*



&nbsp;
