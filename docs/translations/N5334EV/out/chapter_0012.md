# Episode 12: Howard Cloud is Greatly Surprised

## 12話　ハワード・クラウド大いに驚く

A new chapter begins. And finally, we are in the human settlement.＾＾；

*新章スタートします。そんで、ようやく人里です＾＾；*

----------------

&nbsp;

Howard Cloud was feeling melancholic.

*ハワード・クラウドは憂鬱であった。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Currently, Howard was driving a one-horse carriage pulled by a black horse, making his way home.

*今ハワードは黒毛の馬に引かれた一頭立ての馬車を操車して、家路を辿っている。*

&nbsp;

Wearing a black sun hat and jacket with a white shirt, his gray hair and mustache peeking out from under the hat, he sat straight and composed while handling the carriage.

*黒い日除け帽と上着に白いシャツ、帽子から覗くグレーの頭髪と口髭、馬車を操る姿勢は真っ直ぐで澱みが無い。*

His appearance alone suggested that he was an honest man.

*その出で立ち、姿だけで彼が実直な人間である事が窺い知れるようだ。*

&nbsp;

Behind his thick eyebrows, strong gray eyes were gazing.

*濃い眉の奥には、強い眼差しの灰色の目が佇んでいる。*

However, there was nothing intimidating about it.

*しかしそれは決して威圧を感じさせる物では無い。*

Rather, it exuded a friendly warmth.

*寧ろ親しみ易い暖か味を湛えている。*

At that moment, he slightly twisted his mouth, which was hidden by his beard, into a thoughtful expression.

*そんな彼が髭に埋まった口元を少しだけ歪め思案顔だ。*

&nbsp;

Under normal circumstances, his nephew Will would have been riding in this carriage, and they would have been on their way back to their home in Amukam together.

*本来であれば、この馬車には甥のウィルを乗せ、共にアムカムにある我が家への帰路に就いている筈だった。*

However, what awaited Howard at the stagecoach stop was a letter handed to him by the driver.

*だが駅馬車の停車場でハワードを待っていたものは、御者から手渡された一通の手紙だ。*

&nbsp;

It was from his nephew, apologizing for not being able to keep their promise due to an unexpected exam that left him no time.

*それは甥からの物で、急な試験でどうしても時間が取れなくなった事。*

The letter was filled with polite apologies for not being able to keep the promise and words of concern for his uncle and aunt.

*約束を守れない事に対する丁寧な謝罪と、伯父と伯母への労りの言葉で埋められていた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Will, the son of Howard's brother Philip, was a lively 17-year-old young man in his second year at a high school in Dekkenbel, one of the twelve cities.

*ハワードの弟フィリップの息子であるウィルは、12都市の一つデケンベルにある高等校の2回生に在籍している今年17歳の快活な若者だ。*

&nbsp;

Every summer, he would come to Amukam for about a week and spend time with the Cloud family.

*夏は毎年1週間ほどアムカムへ遊びに来て、クラウド家で過している。*

&nbsp;

For the childless Cloud couple, Will's visits were an eagerly awaited event each year.

*子供のいないクラウド夫妻にとって、ウィルの訪問は毎年心待ちなイベントなのだ。*

Since he entered the boarding high school, it had been arranged that he would come directly here at the start of the long summer vacation.

*全寮制の高等校へ進学してからは夏の長期休暇が始まると、そのままこちらへ来る手筈になっていた。*

&nbsp;

How to comfort his wife Sonia? She had been looking forward to it so much.

*妻のソニアをどう慰めたものか。あれだけ楽しみにしていたのに。*

For over a week, she and the maid Elrose had been happily preparing, discussing this and that.

*一週間も前から女中のエルローズと二人で、ああでもないこうでもないと楽しそうに準備に勤しんでいたのだ。*

He could easily picture the disappointment on their faces.

*二人の落胆ぶりが目に浮かんでしまう。*

&nbsp;

As he sighed thoughtfully, Howard urged the carriage onward toward home.

*ハワードは、思案気に嘆息しながら帰路へと馬車を進ませていた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

At this time of year, an unexpected exam could be roughly guessed.

*この時期に突然の試験と云うのも大体察しは付く。*

It was most likely related to the disturbances in the Deipara Mountains.

*十中八九デイパーラ山脈の異変絡みだろう。*

&nbsp;

The sacred Deipara, said to be inhabited by gods.

*神々が棲まうと言われる聖なるデイパーラ。*

The disturbances there occurred two days ago.

*そこに異変が起きたのは二日前の事だ。*

&nbsp;

Some said the mountains shone.

*山々が輝いたと言う者も居る。*

Many witnesses claimed to have seen flashes of light.

*閃光を見たと言う目撃者は数多い。*

Afterward, the clouds dissipated, and the atmosphere trembled.

*その後に雲が掻き消え大気が震えた。*

The vibrations in the air were something anyone from this village would have experienced.

*大気の振動はこの村の者なら誰もが経験した事だ。*

&nbsp;

And the mountains changed shape. Even the peak of Mother Dear was significantly altered.

*そして山々が形を変えた。母なるデアの頂さえ、その身が削られ大きく変貌していたのだ。*

&nbsp;

Some people were clamoring that this was the wrath of the gods or the revival of an evil deity.

*これを神々の怒りだとも邪神の復活だとも騒ぐ者も居る。*

&nbsp;

In any case, the impact it had on various regions was immeasurable.

*いずれにしても各地に与えた影響は計り知れない。*

A survey team would likely be organized.

*恐らくは調査団が編成されるのであろう。*

The staffing of personnel was urgent.

*人員の編成は急務だ。*

&nbsp;

Moreover, with the disturbances in the gods' mountains, there would likely be those who would sow discord among the people, and the activation of magical beasts in various places was also possible.

*また、神々の山脈の異変だ、人心を惑わす輩も現れるだろうし各地で魔獣の活性化もあり得る。*

Strengthening security against these threats was necessary.

*それらに対する警備力の強化も必要だ。*

Inevitably, there would be a shortage of manpower.

*必然的に人手不足になる。*

&nbsp;

Will was an excellent candidate for knighthood.

*ウィルは優秀な騎士候補の学生だ。*

As a supplementary force for the allocated personnel, a practical training exam would likely be conducted.

*割かれた人員に対する補充要員として、試験と云う名の実地研修が実施されるのだろう。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As Howard passed through a side road of the Amukam Forest, he was contemplating such matters.

*ハワードは今、アムカムの森の脇道を通りながらそんな事を考えていた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Amukam Forest.

*アムカムの森。*

This is the edge of the country that spreads to the north of the village of Amukam.

*アムカムの村北側に広がるこの国の果てだ。*

&nbsp;

Though the forest bears the name of this village, it is actually part of the southern end of the Iroshio Great Forest.

*この村の名前を有する森だが、その実はイロシオ大森林の南端の一部の事だ。*

&nbsp;

If there were disturbances in the Deipara Mountains, it would not be surprising if there were some effects on the Iroshio Great Forest that spreads at its foot.

*デイパーラ山脈に異変があったなら、その麓に広がるイロシオ大森林にも何らかの影響があったとしても可笑しくは無い。*

For the people living in this village, vigilance against the Amukam Forest is a part of their lives and one of the most important matters.

*この村に住む者にとって、アムカムの森の警戒は生活の一部でもあり最も重要な案件の一つだ。*

&nbsp;

Moreover, there is no one in this country who knows this forest better than the villagers.

*それに、この村の民以上にこの森に詳しい者はこの国には居ない。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(If a full-fledged survey team heads to the Iroshio Great Forest, personnel will have to be allocated from this village as well. It is impossible to reach Deipara by passing through Iroshio. Still, we must advance as far as we can.)

*（本格的な調査団がイロシオ大森林へ向かう事になれば、この村からも人員を割かねばならん。イロシオを抜けデイパーラへ辿り着くなど到底できるものではない。それでも行ける所まで進まねばなるまいな）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As Howard drove the carriage, he was deep in thought.

*ハワードは馬車を走らせながら思索する。*

&nbsp;

Now, Howard was moving westward along the side road with the Amukam Forest to his right.

*今ハワードはアムカムの森を右手に見て、その脇道を西へ向けて移動していた。*

A thick log fence surrounded the edge of the forest.

*森の縁には太い丸太で組まれた防護柵が、森を囲う様に設置されている。*

The road was built along that fence.

*道はその柵に沿って作られていた。*

It was a path that would not normally need to be taken, but he wanted to check the current state of the forest.

*本来なら通る必要のない道だが、森の現状も確認しておきたかった。*

&nbsp;

To be honest, thinking about how to tell his wife about Will made him choose a longer route.

*本音を言えば、妻へウィルの事を伝える時の事を考えると、つい大回りな道を選択してしまったのだが…。*

&nbsp;

Suddenly, he felt something unusual in the right side of the forest.

*ふと、右の森の中に何時もとは違う何かを感じた。*

&nbsp;

The Amukam Forest is managed by the villagers who act as its guardians.

*アムカムの森は村が守り人となり管理もしている。*

Within 200 to 300 meters from the edge of the forest, magical beasts do not usually appear.

*森の端から2～300メートル程奥までは、まず魔獣は出ない。*

&nbsp;

Villagers are always on guard, and if they spot a magical beast, they promptly deal with it.

*常に村人が警戒に当たっていて、魔獣を発見すれば速やかに処理を行っているからだ。*

&nbsp;

Weak magical beasts that make their homes on the outskirts of the forest can be handled without issue even by village children.

*森の外周を住処にするような弱い魔獣なら、村の子供でも問題なく対処できる。*

&nbsp;

Occasionally, more powerful magical beasts rise from deeper within, but in those cases, the village's civil protection group takes action.

*時折、もっと深淵から上がってくる強力な魔獣もいるが、その時は村の護民団が事に当たる。*

&nbsp;

In terms of pure combat power, the civil protection group's strength is not inferior to that of the knight order in the royal capital.

*純粋な戦闘力だけ見れば、護民団のそれは王都の騎士団にも引けは取らない。*

&nbsp;

In fact, those of higher rank can even surpass the knight order.

*むしろ上位の者ならば騎士団をも上回る。*

&nbsp;

Now, an unusual presence was wafting from within that forest.

*今、その森の中から只ならぬ気配が漂って来ていた。*

Since the disturbances in Deipara, the village had raised the alert level for the forest.

*デイパーラの異変以降、村では森の警戒レベルを上げている。*

&nbsp;

Even now, many villagers were patrolling inside and outside the forest, keeping a watchful eye, and if there were any abnormalities, an alarm would immediately sound in the village.

*今も多くの村人が森の中へ外へと巡回し目を光らせ、異常があれば直ちに村に警報が響く筈だ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(There may be something that has slipped through the security net.)

*（警戒網から抜けたモノが居るのかもしれんな）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Howard, on guard, stopped the carriage.

*ハワードは警戒しつつ馬車を停めた。*

He was just before a T-junction where the fence ended and the road extended into the forest.

*ちょうど柵が途切れ、森の中へと道が伸びる丁字路の手前だ。*

He placed his sun hat on the seat, drew his beloved sword, and got off the carriage.

*日除け帽を座席に置き、愛用の剣を手に馬車を降りた。*

&nbsp;

He instructed the horse to stay put and stopped the carriage's wheels.

*馬にこの場で留まるよう言い含め、馬車の車輪を止める。*

This horse, named Regulus, had been with him for over 20 years.

*レグルスと言う名のこの馬はもう20年以上共に過ごしている。*

&nbsp;

In human years, it must be quite old.

*人の年齢にすれば結構な歳の筈だ。*

As he stroked the fine scars on its front legs, he thought.

*前脚の鱗の細かい傷を撫でながら思う。*

&nbsp;

Having been together for so long, this exceptionally intelligent horse seemed to understand Howard's words, meeting his gaze and starting to nibble on the grass at its feet.

*付き合いが長い上、殊の外賢いこの馬はハワードの言葉が分ったとばかりに目を合わせ、足元の草を食み始めた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(If I leave the carriage here, someone on patrol will soon find it and realize that I have entered the forest from here. It would be quick if August found it.)

*（馬車をここへ止めて置けば、程なく見回りの誰かが見つけ、ワシがここから森へ入った事に気付くだろう。オーガスト辺りが見つけてくれれば話しは早いのだがな）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Thinking such things, Howard, with his sword at his waist, entered the forest.

*そんな事を考えながらハワードは、腰に愛剣を携え森へと入って行く。*

&nbsp;

This path leads about 100 meters into the forest and opens into a small clearing.

*この道は森の中へ100メートル程進むと、ちょっとした広場に出る。*

It was a place cleared by the villagers in a circular shape with a radius of about 10 meters.

*村人達で半径10メートル程の円形に拓いた場所だ。*

&nbsp;

This serves as a relay point for vigilance in the forest and, depending on the situation, battles with magical beasts may also take place here.

*ここが森の中で警戒に当たる時の中継点となったり、場合によってはバトルポイントとして魔獣との戦闘も行われる。*

&nbsp;

Such places are scattered throughout the forest.

*こういった場所は森の彼方此方に在る。*

From here, paths extend east and west, leading to similar clearings further ahead.

*ココからも東西に道が伸び、その先にこの場所と同じような広場が作られていた。*

They are spread throughout the forest like an ant nest, every 500 meters to 1 kilometer apart.

*500メートルから1キロ置きに、アリの巣のように森の中に広げているのだ。*

&nbsp;

Howard stepped into that clearing.

*ハワードはその広場の中へ足を踏み入れた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(There are indeed some... Thankfully, nothing attacked me on the way here... Are they watching me? Hmm... Three? No, there are four? This is bad; the presence is unusual. It's clearly different from that of weaklings...!)

*（居るな…有難い事に途中の道すがら襲って来る事が無かったが…向こうも様子を見ていると云う事か？ふむ…3？いや、4は居るか？イカンな、気配が尋常では無いぞ。雑魚のそれとは明らかに違う…！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was nearing noon, and the sun was high, shining brightly.

*そろそろ昼に差し掛かる頃だ、陽は高く日差しは眩しい。*

However, the Amukam Forest is deep.

*だがアムカムの森は深い。*

Even at this time, there are many places where sunlight does not reach.

*この時間でも陽が届かぬ場所も多い。*

Yet, this clearing received ample sunlight.

*しかし、この広場には十分な陽が差し込んでいる。*

&nbsp;

That is why the shadows of the trees made it even harder to see the figures lurking deeper within.

*だからこそ樹木の陰がなお一層、その奥に居るモノの姿を見辛くする。*

&nbsp;

He could sense movement; he heard the sound of something heavy dragging.

*動いている物がいるのが分る、ズルッズルと重い何かを引き摺るような音もする。*

Two pairs of red eyes glowed.

*2対の赤い目が光る。*

Another pair nearby.

*その近くにもう一対。*

Further away, another pair, and yet another pair close by.

*更に少し離れた場所にも一対、そしてその傍にもう一対。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(Hmm. Four creatures... No? That's not right!)

*（ぬぅ。4体か…いや？違うな！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

One of them slowly revealed itself in the clearing.

*その内の一体がゆっくりと広場の中へ姿を現す。*

It was a giant snake with red eyes.

*赤い目を持つ巨大な蛇だ。*

Its neck was about 50 centimeters in diameter. It looked like it could swallow an adult whole.

*首回りは直径50センチ程か？大人をそのまま呑み下せそうだ。*

There was another head branching off from its thick neck.

*その太い首を持つ頭がもう一つ。胴体から分れて出ている。*

This magical beast was called the "Two-Headed Boa."

*『ツーヘッド・ボア』この魔獣の呼び名だ。*

&nbsp;

The body supporting the two heads was thick and flat.

*2つの首を支える胴体は太く平たい。*

It was about 2 meters long, with a slender tail extending about 1 meter.

*長さは2メートル程、その太い胴体から細くなった尻尾が1メートル程伸びている。*

At the tip of that tail, a poisonous yellow thorn protruded, clearly identifiable as a venomous spike.

*その先端には毒々しい黄色の棘が、明らかに毒針と分る棘が突き出していた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(I was careless! This is bad. The "Two-Headed Boa" is a magical beast found in deeper layers. It's too much for younglings who only deal with shallow layers. Even I am in a precarious situation with my current equipment. But if the children were to encounter this, it would be disastrous!)

*（抜かったわ！これは不味いぞ。『ツーヘッド・ボア』など中層以上の深い所にいる魔獣だ。浅層相手の若造どもでは荷が重すぎる。ワシとて今の装備だけでは相当にまずい。だが子供らが出くわしでもしたら取り返しがつかん！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He placed his hand on the sword at his waist.

*腰の剣に手を当てる。*

It was a long sword he had used for many years.

*長年使いこんだロングソードだ。*

He had enough confidence to face opponents from the middle layers.

*中層の相手にも十分太刀打ちできる自信はある。*

&nbsp;

However, the "Two-Headed Boa" was troublesome.

*だが『ツーヘッド・ボア』は厄介だ。*

With two heads bearing venomous fangs, they would coordinate and attack separately.

*猛毒の牙を持つ頭が二つ、連携を取って別々に襲って来る。*

If one were to be bitten by its poison, a human would not last half a moment before succumbing to death.

*その毒にやられれば人間など半時も持たず死に至るだろう。*

&nbsp;

And then there were the poisonous spikes on its tail; while focusing on the heads, it could attack from another direction.

*そして尾の毒針だ、頭に意識を向けていると別の方向から襲って来る。*

That poison would not lead to immediate death, but it would cause paralysis and rob the body of its freedom.

*その毒は直ちに死に至るモノでは無いが、麻痺を引き起こし身体の自由を奪う。*

It was not to be underestimated.

*甘く見られるモノでは無い。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In reality, fighting the "Two-Headed Boa" was like a 3-on-1 battle.

*実質『ツーヘッド・ボア』との戦闘は3対1の戦いと同じだ。*

It was not an easy opponent that could be defeated without taking any damage.

*攻撃を全く受け切らずに倒せるほど甘い相手ではない。*

Protective gear that could withstand its venomous fangs was necessary.

*毒牙をしのげる防具は必要だ。*

&nbsp;

With two of them, it was like a 6-on-1 fight.

*それが2体。これは6対1の戦いのような物だ。*

Under normal circumstances, the correct action would be to flee immediately.

*本来、この状況なら直ちに逃げ出すのが正解だ。*

Engaging in a frontal battle was madness.

*正面からの戦闘など正気の沙汰ではない。*

&nbsp;

But Howard discarded his jacket and drew his long sword.

*だがハワードは上着を脱ぎ捨て、ロングソードを引き抜いた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(After all, it doesn't seem like they will let me escape...)

*（どうせ逃がしてくれそうには無いしな…）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Another boa appeared from a slightly distant spot and entered the clearing.

*もう一匹のボアが、少し離れた場所から広場へ姿を現した。*

It spread its two heads wide, blocking Howard's path, and approached him from both sides.

*双頭を左右に広げ行く手を遮り、左右から挟み込むように迫って来る。*

&nbsp;

Then, he had no choice but to fight.

*ならば、やらずばなるまいよ。*

&nbsp;

He shouldered his long sword and lowered his stance.

*とロングソードを肩へ担ぐように構え、腰を落とした。*

&nbsp;

He had to move before they could surround him!

*挟み込まれる前に動く！*

&nbsp;

He kicked the ground and lunged toward the right boa, entering the range of the first one.

*地を蹴り一息で右側のボアへ、最初に現れた方の間合いへ入り込む。*

&nbsp;

He swung the long sword down vigorously in front of the right head and then slashed upward to the left.

*ロングソードを右の首の目の前で勢いよく下に降ろし、そのまま左側へ斬り上げた。*

The blade sharply cut through the throat of the left head.

*刃は鋭く左の首の喉元を切り裂いた。*

&nbsp;

It did not sever it completely, but the weight of the head caused it to lean back, nearly tearing off.

*切断には至らないが首の重さで後ろに仰け反り、千切れかけだ。*

Without losing momentum, he spun his body and circled around to the back of the boa, beside the nearly severed head.

*そのまま体を回転させ、千切れかけの首の側からボアの後ろ側に回り込んだ。*

&nbsp;

Without losing his speed, he raised the long sword and struck down at the base of the poisonous tail.

*勢いを殺さずそのままで、ロングソードを振りかぶり毒針の付け根へ叩き付けた。*

The pain and anger from having its tail severed caused the remaining head to turn toward its back.

*尾を断ち切られた痛みと怒りで、残った首が背中側に首を向ける。*

&nbsp;

But Howard did not hesitate and swung the long sword horizontally from the left side.

*だがハワードは間髪入れずロングソードを左側から水平に振り切る。*

This time, the boa's head was cleanly severed.

*今度は綺麗にボアの首が落ちた。*

&nbsp;

He executed the entire series of movements fluidly, all in the span of a brief moment.

*一連の動作を流れるように、ほんの一瞬きの間にやってのけた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The other boa, having followed Howard's movement, tried to attack him from behind, but it quickly lost its target as Howard hid behind the first one.

*もう一匹のボアはハワードが動いた直後に後を追い、後ろから襲いかかろうとしたが、すぐさま一匹目の陰に彼が隠れてしまった為、攻めあぐねてしまった。*

&nbsp;

Now, it was showing its vigilance and anger, baring its fangs and making threatening sounds while gauging the distance to Howard.

*今は警戒と怒りを露わにし、口を開いて牙を見せつけながら威嚇音を出し、ハワードと間合いを取り合っている。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(Well then, this makes it even!)

*（さて、これでイーブンと云う訳だ！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He turned the dire situation around.

*絶体絶命の状況をひっくり返す。*

It was truly exhilarating.

*実に痛快だ。*

He couldn't help but grin.

*思わず口元が吊り上る。*

He twirled the tip of his long sword, measuring the distance as he circled around the boa.

*クルリクルリとロングソードの切っ先を右で、左で回しながらボアを回り込むように距離を測って行く。*

&nbsp;

Then, something moved at the edge of his vision.

*と、視界の端で何かが動いた。*

He saw something leap out from the shadows of the left trees.

*左の樹木の陰から何かが飛び出して来たのが見えた。*

It was a "Gray Wolf."

*『グレイ・ウルフ』だ。*

A large dark gray wolf-like magical beast with a long mane on its back.

*背中に長いタテガミを生やしたダークグレイの大型狼の魔獣だ。*

It should also be found in the middle layers.

*コイツも本来は中層以上に居る筈だ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(I messed up! I misjudged the presence! There were indeed three creatures!)

*（しまった！気配を見誤った！やはり3体居たのか！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Gray Wolf lunged straight for Howard's neck.

*グレイウルフは、真っ直ぐハワードの首筋目掛けて飛び掛って来た。*

Its body exceeded 2 meters in length.

*その身体は2メートルを超えている。*

&nbsp;

Just being tackled would be fatal.

*体当たりされただけでも致命的だ。*

Howard instinctively dropped his body to evade, but its claws gouged into his left upper arm through his shirt.

*ハワードは咄嗟に身体を倒して躱すが、その爪が左の二の腕をシャツの上から抉って行く。*

The Gray Wolf's claws were hard and vicious.

*グレイウルフの爪も硬く凶悪だ。*

&nbsp;

As he fell, he swung his long sword beneath the wolf's body.

*身体を倒しながらウルフの身体の下でロングソードを振り切った。*

The blade sliced through the wolf's belly horizontally, spilling its entrails.

*刃はそのままウルフの腹を真横に切り裂き臓物を零れ落とさせる。*

Just before his back hit the ground, he felt something approaching his feet.

*背が地に着く直前、何かが足元に迫って来るのを感じた。*

&nbsp;

He tried to dodge, but it was too late; he felt the flesh above his left ankle being gouged.

*躱そうとするが間に合わない、左の踝の上の肉が抉られたのが分った。*

&nbsp;

"Ugh!!"

*「ぐっ！！」*

&nbsp;

As his body hit the ground, he rolled away from the boa to create distance and quickly got back on his feet.

*身体が地面に着くと同時に身体を転がしボアから距離を取り、すぐさま体を起こした。*

&nbsp;

The boa's poisonous spike was attacking Howard's left leg.

*ボアの毒針がハワードの左足を襲っていた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(What do you mean even? You fool! You got carried away!)

*（何がイーブンかっ！この粗忽者がっ！調子に乗ったわ！！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He scolded himself for neglecting to be vigilant.

*周りへの警戒を怠った己を叱責する。*

He had already lost feeling in his left leg below the knee.

*既に左の脛から下の感覚が無い。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(Dodging... is difficult. My power isn't enough, and I can't evade completely. Then, I'll just have to deal a fatal blow right here. I can't let this thing escape unscathed!)

*（避けながら…と云うのは難しいな。一撃の力が足りんだろうし避けきれん。ならばこのまま致命の一撃をくれてやろう。コイツを無傷で外に出す訳にはいかん！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Howard crouched down, positioning the tip of his long sword on the ground to the left, gathering his strength.

*ハワードはその場で腰を落とし、ロングソードの切っ先を地に付けるように左に構え、力を溜める。*

He could hardly feel his left arm; he focused all his senses to swing the long sword.

*左腕の感覚も殆ど無い、このまま身体を発条にしてロングソードを振り切る為に、全神経を研ぎ澄ました。*

&nbsp;

As the prey stopped moving, the boa lunged at Howard.

*獲物が動きを止めた事で、ボアは一気に仕留めにかかる。*

Opening its double mouths, it rushed toward him to stab its venomous fangs.

*双頭の口を開きハワードへ向け、その毒牙を突き立てようと一気に距離を縮めて来た。*

&nbsp;

Howard's muscles creaked as he sank deeper, timing the moment to unleash his attack.

*ハワードはギシリと筋肉を軋ませ、解き放つ瞬間を計る為、更に身体を深く沈める。*

&nbsp;

However, he was dragged down by his left leg, slightly losing his balance.

*しかし、感覚の無くなった左脚に引き摺られ、僅かに体勢が崩れてしまう。*

&nbsp;

The boa leaped at him, but Howard's initial movement was delayed.

*ボアが躍りかかるが、ハワードは初動が遅れてしまった。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Just before the boa's fangs reached Howard,

*ボアの牙がハワードへ届く一歩前。*

a spear suddenly pierced the ground between them.

*突然、槍が両者の間に突き刺さった。*

The boa flinched at the object that pierced its nose, momentarily stunned.

*ボアは鼻先に刺さった物に驚き一瞬怯んだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(A spear? No, a branch?! This is a tree branch!)

*（槍？いや、枝か？！これは木の枝だっ！）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Seizing the opportunity of its momentary hesitation, Howard released his strength.

*その怯みを逃さず、ハワードが力を解き放つ。*

He aimed for the area beneath the neck where its heart was located.

*狙うは首の生え際の下、コイツの心臓のある場所だ。*

The long sword was swung powerfully and horizontally.

*ロングソードは解き放たれるまま、力強く水平に薙ぎ払われる。*

&nbsp;

Along with the piercing branch, he cleaved the boa's body in two.

*突き立つ枝諸共ボアの胴体を両断した。*

&nbsp;

The severed body writhed in agony, thrashing about, but without its heart, it soon ceased to move.

*二つに分かれた身体は苦しげにその身を暴れさせ、のた打ち回るが心臓を失った身体は直ぐに動きを止めて行く。*

&nbsp;

Howard exhausted his strength and collapsed to the ground.

*ハワードは力を使い果たし、その場に倒れ込んだ。*

His beloved sword slipped from his hand and fell beside him.

*愛剣もその手を離れ、並ぶように横へ落ちた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(This is bad; I need to comfort Sonia. I shouldn't be lying here like this... I can't feel my lower body anymore...)

*（いかんなぁ、ソニアを慰めてやらねばならんのに。こんな所で寝てる場合では無いんだが…もう下半身の感覚がないわ…）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lying on his back, basking in the sunlight, he gazed at the blue sky and thought such things... when suddenly, he felt something move above his head.

*仰向けになり日差しを浴びながら、青い空を眺めてそんな事を考えていた…が。*

&nbsp;

He briefly felt alarmed,

*フッと頭の上で何かが動く気配を感じた。*

thinking it might still be there, but it seemed to be a person.

*まだ居たのかと一瞬警戒したが、どうやら人のようだ。*

The figure knelt beside Howard, leaning in close and speaking to him.

*その人物はハワードの傍らまで来て膝を突き、顔を近づけ声を掛けて来た*

&nbsp;

"Are you... okay?"

*「ダイジョブ・・・です・・・か？」*

&nbsp;

When Howard saw the figure in his line of sight, his breath momentarily stopped.

*視界にその人影が入った時、ハワードの息が一瞬止まった。*

&nbsp;

In that instant, he felt as if he saw someone overlapping with the shadow looking down at him.

*刹那の間、見上げるその影に重なる人物を見た気がしたのだ。*

&nbsp;

(...! No way! Ravi?! Could it be?!!)

*（…！そんな！ラヴィ？！まさか？！！）*

&nbsp;

But he quickly dismissed such thoughts.

*だが、そんな事はある筈が無い…と思い直す。*

&nbsp;

The fleeting illusion vanished, revealing a girl before him.

*一瞬の幻影は消え去り、少女の姿をそこに見た。*

A girl with brilliantly shining red hair, peering down with cobalt green eyes that sparkled like crystals, asking with concern.

*鮮やかな輝くような赤い髪の少女が、クリスタルのように煌めくコバルトグリーンの瞳で覗きこみ、心配そうに尋ねて来ているのだ。*

&nbsp;

Her voice was transparent, gentle, and lovely.

*透き通った優しげで愛らしい声だ。*

&nbsp;

The girl's attire was unlike anything seen around here.

*その少女の装いはこの辺りでは見ない服装だ。*

It looked as if she had wandered through the forest, with various rips and dirt all over.

*森の中を彷徨ったようにアチコチ破れたり汚れたりしている。*

Her arms and legs were similarly dirty, and her face was quite soiled.

*手足も同様だ、顔も随分汚れている。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(What a beautiful girl, but it's a shame she's in such a state... Is she a lost traveler?)

*（美しい少女なのに可哀相に台無しだ…迷い人か？）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then the girl reached her hand behind Howard's head.

*すると少女はハワードの頭の後ろに手を差し入れた。*

&nbsp;

"I'm going to... take you to the shade... now."

*「ひかげ・・・いきます・・・いま」*

&nbsp;

Saying this, she pulled him closer.

*そう言って身体を引き寄せた。*

&nbsp;

Realizing that she was trying to lift him, Howard panicked.

*自分を抱きかかえようとしていると判ったハワードが慌てる。*

&nbsp;

"Wait, you can't do this alone..."

*「ま、待ちなさい、一人では…」*

&nbsp;

Howard was 195 cm tall.

*ハワードの身長は195cmある。*

At 62 years old, he had never neglected his daily training, and his body was still covered in well-defined muscles.

*今年で62だが日々の鍛練は怠った事は無い、その身体は今だ隆々とした筋肉に覆われている。*

There was no way a petite girl could lift him.

*とても小柄な少女一人の力で持ち上がる物では無い。*

&nbsp;

However, disregarding Howard's concerns, the girl lifted him without hesitation.

*しかし、そんなハワードの心配を余所に、少女は何の躊躇いも無く彼を抱き上げる。*

Howard's eyes widened in surprise, speechless.

*驚き目を見開くハワード。言葉も出ない。*

Noticing Howard's gaze, the girl tilted her head slightly, looking back at him with a puzzled expression.

*そんなハワードの視線に気付き、少女はコテンと小首を傾げ不思議そうな顔で見返す。*

&nbsp;

She effortlessly carried Howard, gently laying him down in the shade.

*トットットと軽々とハワードを運び、日影に優しく横たえる。*

&nbsp;

"I'll... bring the sword... now."

*「けん・・・もってきます・・・いま」*

&nbsp;

Saying this, she left to retrieve the sword.

*そう言うとハワードを置いて、剣のある場所まで戻って行った。*

&nbsp;

"Wait..."

*「ま……」*

&nbsp;

There might still be magical beasts around.

*まだ周りに魔獣がいるかもしれない。*

He tried to warn her, but no sound came out.

*そう注意を促そうとしたが声が出ない。*

The paralysis had spread significantly.

*麻痺がかなり回って来てしまった。*

&nbsp;

The girl picked up the long sword and walked toward him.

*少女がロングソードを拾い上げ、こちらへ向かって歩いてくる。*

From the shadows of the dense forest behind her, a dark gray mass leaped toward her.

*その後ろ、陰の濃い森の中からダークグレイの塊が少女へ向かって飛び出して来た。*

It was the Gray Wolf.

*グレイ・ウルフだ。*

&nbsp;

"Oh...!"

*「あ……！」*

&nbsp;

Howard instinctively tried to shout, but no voice came out.

*咄嗟にハワードが叫びを上げようとしたが声が出ない。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What a disaster! Due to his own incompetence, not only was he in danger, but now this unknown girl was involved too!!

*なんってこった！己が未熟さで自分だけならまだしも、この見ず知らずの娘まで巻き込んでしまうとは！！*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What a disgrace for the life he had dedicated to serving as a civil protector.

*護民官として剣を捧げて来た人生の最後で、なんという失態であろうか。*

He bit his lip in frustration at himself.

*己に対する憤りで唇を噛み切る。*

Just as the wolf's fangs seemed about to reach the girl.

*今まさにその牙が少女へ届くと思われた瞬間。*

&nbsp;

The girl suddenly leaped gracefully.

*フワリ、と少女が舞った。*

&nbsp;

The Gray Wolf was cleaved in two.

*グレイ・ウルフが二つになる。*

It was sliced diagonally from the base of its front legs to its back, and it fell forward, propelled by its own momentum, landing in front of the girl.

*前脚の付け根から背中にかけて斜めに切り離され、跳び出した勢いのまま少女の脇を抜け前方に落下する。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A shiver ran down Howard's spine as he lay motionless.

*動かぬ体の背筋にゾクリと走る物があった。*

&nbsp;

What a beautiful sword technique.

*何と云う美しい剣筋だろうか。*

There was no strain or tension; the sword danced naturally.

*何の気負いも力みも無くただ自然に剣が舞った。*

The blade slid in as if drawn in, passing through without any resistance.

*スッと吸い込まれるように刀身が入り、何の抵抗も無く抜けて行く。*

Was his sword truly this sharp? No, it was clearly the skill of the wielder.

*自分の剣はこれ程の切れ味を持っていたのだろうか？否、使い手の力量である事は明白だ。*

It was a movement so clear and unclouded.

*一点の曇りも無い澄み切った動きだ。*

In comparison, his own swordsmanship felt so rough.

*それに比べ己が剣のなんと荒い事か。*

The glimmer of that flowing blade, that beautiful light, was something he would never forget.

*あの流れるような切っ先の光跡、あの美しい光は忘れられる物では無い。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The girl's red hair swayed, and her skirt fluttered down as if following her movements.

*赤い髪を揺らし、フワッと少女の動きを追いかけるようにスカートの裾が舞い降りた。*

&nbsp;

"This is... okay... now."

*「さいご・・・これが・・・だいじょぶ」*

&nbsp;

With a calm gaze, the girl looked down at what was once the Gray Wolf and murmured.

*涼しげな眼差しでグレイ・ウルフだった物を見下ろしながら少女が呟く。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then the girl suddenly noticed Howard and gasped.

*と、少女がハワードを見てハッとする。*

&nbsp;

"I'm sorry... the poison... took longer... to notice."

*「ごめなさい・・・どく・・・おそなった・・・きづくの」*

&nbsp;

She hurriedly rushed over to Howard.

*慌てたようにハワードの元へ駆け寄って来た。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Kneeling beside Howard's left side, she placed her right palm over the wound on his shin.

*横になったハワードの左側で膝を突き、脛の傷口の上へ右の掌を当てた。*

&nbsp;

"I'm going to... heal... it... right away... wait."

*「なおす・・・ます・・・すぐ・・・まって」*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(Did she just say she's going to heal me? What is this girl planning to do? Could it be! Can she use detoxification techniques at such a young age?)

*（今治すと言ったか？何をする気なのだこの娘は？まさか！この若さで解毒の技が使えると？）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Whatever the girl intended to do, Howard could only watch in his immobile state.

*少女が何をするにしても動かぬ体では見守るしかない。*

He could faintly hear her mumbling something.

*ハッキリとは聞こえないが何やら呟くのが分る。*

&nbsp;

Light gathered between her hands and feet.

*脚と掌の間に光が集まる。*

Howard's eyes widened in astonishment once more.

*ハワードの目が再び驚きで見開かれた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(Oh! Healing light?! She can truly use it... and with such warmth, this young girl?)

*（おお！癒しの輝きか？！本当に使えるとは…それもこれだけ暖か味のある光を、この歳若い少女が？）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He felt warmth spreading through his left leg, which had lost sensation.

*感覚が無くなった筈の左脚に暖か味が広がる。*

Slowly, he could feel that warmth circulating throughout his body.

*ユックリとその温かさが全身を廻るのが分る。*

The soft warmth seeped into the area where the wolf had bitten his left arm and even into the lip he had bitten earlier.

*左腕のウルフに抉られた部分にも、先程噛み切った唇も、柔らかい温かさが沁みて行く。*

He felt all the tension leave his body, and he relaxed.

*全身から力が抜け、身体が楽になって行くのを感じる。*

&nbsp;

Suddenly, the light vanished, and reality returned to his senses.

*フッと光が消え身体に現実の感覚が戻って来た。*

&nbsp;

"I was able to... heal it... successfully."

*「うまく・・・なおす・・・できました」*

The girl sighed in relief, looking at Howard with a joyful smile.

*少女がホッとしたように息をつき、嬉しそうな笑顔をハワードへ向けた。*

&nbsp;

"Oh, I can move, and the wounds... are gone. Amazing."

*「おお、動く、傷も…無い。凄いな」*

&nbsp;

Howard sat up, confirming that the paralysis had lifted and he could move.

*ハワードが身を起こし、身体から麻痺が取れ動ける事を確認した。*

He touched his arms and legs, astonished to find that the wounds had disappeared.

*腕と脚にも触れ、傷が無くなっている事に感嘆する。*

&nbsp;

Healing techniques that speed up wound recovery and reduce pain can be used by many children of this age.

*傷の治しを早め苦痛を軽減する癒しの技なら、このくらいの歳の子供でも使える者は少なくない。*

&nbsp;

However, a healing skill that completely heals wounds, neutralizes poison, and even allows for immediate movement can only be performed by a properly trained priest.

*だが傷を完治させ解毒を行い、あまつさえ直ぐさま動けるようにする治癒の技など、しっかりとした訓練を受けた神官でなくては扱えない。*

He looked at the girl with renewed astonishment.

*改めて驚きの目で少女を見た。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"Thank you; I owe my life to you."

*「ありがとう、君のおかげで助かった」*

&nbsp;

The girl smiled happily.

*少女が嬉しそうに微笑んでいる。*

&nbsp;

"By the way, who are you? Your swordsmanship and healing abilities are far from ordinary. Where do you come from? No, you are not from this country, are you?"

*「それにしても、君は何者なんだね？剣技も癒しも、とても只者とは思えん。一体何処から来たのかね？いや、そもそもこの国の者ではないね？」*

&nbsp;

The girl seemed to freeze, still smiling.

*少女が微笑みのまま固まったようだ。*

&nbsp;

"Oh, I apologize. I shouldn't have bombarded you with questions without introducing myself first... I am Howard Cloud, a decrepit old man as you can see. I want to thank you again. Thanks to you, I have been saved."

*「あっと、すまない。自己紹介もまだなのに立て続けに色々聞いてしまったね…。ワシはハワード・クラウドという、見ての通りくたばり損ないの老骨だ。改めてお礼を言わせて頂くよ。ありがとう、君のおかげで命を拾えた」*

&nbsp;

Howard stood up, straightening himself as he expressed his gratitude.

*ハワードは立ち上がり、居住いを正しながら礼を言う。*

&nbsp;

"My name... is Suzy... I'm glad... you're safe... I was worried..."

*「わたし・・・スージィ・・・いいます・・・です・・・よかった・・・ぶじ・・・あんしん・・・です」*

&nbsp;

The girl smiled at Howard again, handing him the long sword she had been holding.

*少女も改めてハワードへ笑顔を向けながら手に持っていたロングソードを手渡した。*

As Howard accepted the long sword, he pondered.

*ハワードはロングソードを受けとりながら考える。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(The way she speaks hesitantly indicates she is indeed from another country? An illegal immigrant? In this light attire? From her current appearance, it looks like she has spent several days in the forest. Did she get kidnapped abroad and escape into this forest? But is there anyone capable of abducting a girl as skilled as her? No, if drugs were used... In any case, I need to contact her family. This is no place for a girl to be alone.)

*（言葉がたどたどしいのは、やはり国外の者だからか？密入国？この軽装でか？今の装いを見るに数日森の中で過ごしたようにも見える。国外で拐かされ、この森へ逃げ込んだ？だが、この娘ほどの手練れを浚う事が出来る者が居るのか？いや、薬でも使われれば…何れにしても家族と連絡を取る必要はあるだろうな。ここは娘が一人だけで居て良い場所じゃ無い）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The sorrow of parents suddenly losing their daughter was not hard to imagine.

*突然娘を失った両親の嘆きは想像に難くない。*

Especially when he looked at the girl's hair, it tightened his chest even more.

*ましてやこの娘の髪を見ていると、尚の事胸が締め付けられる。*

&nbsp;

He asked the girl about her country, but she mentioned a name he had never heard before.

*娘に自分の国の事を聞いてみたが、初めて聞く名前を口にした。*

&nbsp;

"This country is called Aurora; do you know it?"

*「ここはアウローラと言う国なんだが、分るかね？」*

"Aurora? ...I don't... know."

*「あうろーら？・・・しり・・・ません」*

&nbsp;

So she is indeed from another country...

*やはり国外の者か…。*

&nbsp;

"Do you know where you came from?"

*「自分がどこから来たかは分るかい？」*

&nbsp;

When he asked, the girl hesitantly pointed toward the depths of the forest.

*そう言うと少女は、恐る恐る森の奥の方を指差した。*

Had she truly been kidnapped? No! There was also the possibility that she got lost while traveling with her family.

*本当に攫われたのか？いや！家族と旅行中に遭難した可能性も。*

&nbsp;

"What about your family? Aren't your parents with you?"

*「家族は？ご両親は一緒ではないのかね？」*

&nbsp;

He instinctively grabbed the girl's shoulder.

*思わず少女の肩を掴んでしまった。*

&nbsp;

"Parents? ...I don't have... from the beginning..."

*「りょうしん？・・・いません・・・さいしょ・・・から」*

&nbsp;

(What does this mean? This girl has truly been alone in this forest...)

*（何と云う事だ。この娘は本当に一人でこの森で過ごしていたと言うのか…）*

&nbsp;

He couldn't help but furrow his brow, his expression turning serious.

*思わず眉間に皺を寄せ、厳しい表情になってしまう。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then, from somewhere, he heard a cute sound, "Kuuuu~."

*すると、どこからかク～～～～と言う可愛らしい音が聞こえてきた。*

Looking, he saw the girl blushing and holding her stomach.

*見ると少女が真っ赤になってお腹を押さえている。*

Howard, surprised, released his grip and looked down at her.

*ハワードは驚いたように手を放し、少女を見下ろした。*

&nbsp;

"Oh... I'm sorry... um... excuse me..."

*「あ・・・あの・・・すみま・・・すみません・・・あの」*

&nbsp;

The girl looked down, blushing, and hurriedly apologized.

*少女が下を向いて、赤くなりながら慌てたように謝罪を口にする。*

Howard felt the tension that had been present dissipating slowly.

*ハワードはそれまであった緊迫感が、ゆっくり消えて行くのを感じた。*

As if the poison had been drawn out, he found himself smiling at the girl.

*毒気を抜かれたように、少女を見ながら相好が崩れてしまう。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(It's already past noon... Sonia must be preparing lunch and waiting for me. The details no longer matter. Right now, I want to treat this girl, my benefactor.)

*（もう昼を回っているな……、ソニアが昼食を用意して待ちわびている筈だ。細かい事など、もうどうでも良い。今は恩人であるこの娘をもてなしたい）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"I was planning to return to the mansion for lunch; would you like to join me? My wife is likely preparing plenty of food for the guest she was expecting. It's more than we can handle alone. It would be a great help if you could share a meal with us."

*「これから屋敷へ戻って昼食の予定なのだが、良かったらキミも一緒にどうかな？妻が連れて帰る予定だった客人の分までタップリと料理を用意している筈なのだ。とても我々だけでは片づけられる量ではなくてね。一緒に食事をして貰えると、とても助かるのだよ」*

&nbsp;

Howard spread his arms wide, conveying his welcome to the girl.

*ハワードが大きく手を広げ、歓迎するように少女に伝えた。*

&nbsp;

"Meal... food? ...lunch... plenty?"

*「しょ・・・しょくじ・・・りょうり？・・・ちゅうしょく・・・たっぷり？」*

&nbsp;

The girl looked wide-eyed, trembling slightly, her face turning bright red as she asked back.

*少女がアワアワと目を見開きながら小刻みに震え、真っ赤な顔でハワードを見つめて問い返して来た。*

&nbsp;

"Yes! Plenty of food! Especially herb-roasted chicken! I love that salty chicken."

*「そう！タップリの料理だ！特に鳥のハーブ焼き！ワシはあの塩気の効いた鳥が好きでね」*

&nbsp;

Howard recalled the chicken Sonia had been preparing just before he left, speaking happily.

*ハワードは出がけ間際、ソニアが調理の下ごしらえをしていた鳥を思い出しながら、嬉しそうに語った。*

&nbsp;

"Salt!! Herb!! ...Chicken!"

*「しお！！はーぶ！！・・・とり！」*

&nbsp;

Her eyes widened even more, and they began to glisten; she looked like she was about to cry.

*更に目が見開かれ激しく潤んでくる、今にも涙が零れ落ちそうだ。*

Her mouth was agape, and it seemed like drool was about to spill from her.

*口もアウアウと閉まらなくなっている、こちらからも今にも涎が零れそうだ。*

What a cute girl; this was unacceptable.

*可愛い娘がそれはイケナイ。*

&nbsp;

"How about it? Will you accept my invitation?"

*「どうかな？招待に応じて貰えるかい？」*

&nbsp;

"Would it... be a bother? ...Would it be... an intrusion?"

*「めいわく・・・ない・・・ですか？・・・おじゃま・・・ない・・・ですか？」*

&nbsp;

The girl moved her hands nervously in front of her chest, her face turning bright red, looking as if she might burst into tears at any moment.

*少女は両手を胸の前でワキワキと動かし、顔を真っ赤にして本当に今にも泣き出しそうな様子で聞き返して来た。*

&nbsp;

Howard couldn't help but break into a smile.

*ハワードはつい破顔してしまう。*

&nbsp;

"Of course not! It's not a bother or an intrusion. I want to have lunch with you!"

*「勿論だとも！迷惑でも邪魔でもない。一緒にお昼を食べたいんだ！」*

&nbsp;

Laughing, he extended his right hand, and after looking at his hand, the girl looked at Howard's face, nodded happily several times, and then tightly grasped his right hand with both of hers.

*笑いながら右手を差し出すと、少女は一度その右手を見てからハワードの顔を見て、嬉しそうに何度も頷いてから、両手でその右手にヒシッと掴まった。*

&nbsp;

He couldn't bring Will back, but today's guest was special.

*ウィルは連れて帰れないが、今日のお客は特別だ。*

Now, let's hurry home.

*さあ、早く帰ろう。*

He could already picture Sonia's surprised face.

*ソニアが驚く顔が目に浮かぶ。*

She would surely be delighted.

*きっと喜んでくれるに違いない。*

&nbsp;

Howard took the girl by the hand and hurriedly made his way through the forest, joyfully heading home.

*ハワードは少女を連れ、楽しげに森を抜けて家路を急いだ。*

&nbsp;
