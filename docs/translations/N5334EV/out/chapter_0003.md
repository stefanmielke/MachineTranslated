# Episode 03 Starting Suzy Verification

## 03話　スージィ検証を始める

There are some (?) There are some (?) erotic descriptions in the book. Please be careful if you do not like it.

*若干（？）のエチぃ描写がございます。苦手な方はご注意ください。*


----------------

&nbsp;

'Mmmmmmmmmm!　What am I going to do!"

*「う～むうむうむ！　どうしたもんだろ！？」*

&nbsp;

He raised his eyebrows, bent his mouth into a grimace, and muttered in annoyance.

*眉間を寄せ、むぅ　と口をへの字に曲げて、悩ましげに呟いた。*

&nbsp;

Now it sits on a large rock by the water's edge.

*今は水辺の大きな岩の上に座っている。*

&nbsp;

Gut wide open on the rock, left hand on the base of the left thigh, elbow taut.

*岩の上でガッツリと大股を開き、左手は左の腿の付け根に置き肘を張る。*

He had his right elbow on his right knee and his chin on his palm.

*右膝に右肘を乗せ掌に顎を乗せていた。*

It smells like an old man for an appearance that a daughter of her age would make.

*年頃の娘がする佇まいにしてはオッサン臭い。*

Well, the guy inside is a 32 year old man.

*まぁ、中の人は32のオッサンだが。*

&nbsp;

"I'd say try a skill combo, but it wouldn't last because they'd all blow up first. ......

*「スキルコンボ試すとか言っても、全部最初に爆ぜちゃうから続かないしなぁ……」*

&nbsp;

As I was testing my skills, I found out something.

*スキルを試し撃ちしているウチに、判った事がある。*

They can use not only the skills of their current enchanter job, but also their sub jobs, and even the skills of another character created on the same account.

*今使っているエンチャンター職のスキルだけでは無く、サブ職は勿論、同じアカウントで作った別のキャラのスキルまで使えるのだ。*

&nbsp;

This is too cheat!"

*「これってチート過ぎんだろ！」*

&nbsp;

In other words, it is self-reinforcing and has the hardness and durability of a tanker, but also the attack power of an attacker, a magical turret, and can recover on its own.

*つまり、自己強化可能な上、タンカーの硬さ、耐久力を持ったまま、アタッカーの攻撃力、魔法の砲台にもなって、自力回復も可能という。*

&nbsp;

Ma-sa-ni!　Dream specifications!　Well, it's just a dream! ！！！！"

*「ま・さ・に！　夢の仕様！！　まぁ夢だからねっっ！！！！」*

&nbsp;

In case you are wondering, the forest is in a terrible state in a wide area as a result of getting carried away and trying out a lot of skills.

*因みに、調子に乗ってスキルの試し撃ちを重ねた結果、森が広範囲で酷い状態になっている。*

&nbsp;

Trees were reaped and shattered, and the ground was paved with holes, hollows, rises, burns, and melts. The ground was paved with holes, dips, rises, burns, and melts.

*木々は薙ぎ倒され砕け、地面のあちこちは大穴が開き、窪んだり盛り上がったり燃えたり融けたりと、どこの戦場だよ！？と云う有様。*

It is a very destructive act of nature.

*大変な自然破壊行為である。*

&nbsp;

Radar also proved to be able to determine a radius of approximately 10 kilometers.

*レーダーも、およそ半径10キロほどの範囲が把握できる事が分かった。*

As of now, there is no Mob response in the 5 km square. It is completely dead. It is a death zone.

*今現在、5キロ四方にMobの反応は無い。完全に枯れている。デスゾーンである。*

&nbsp;

In contrast to the hellish state of the back of the house, what spreads out before one's eyes is a very quiet and relaxing space.

*そんな背面の地獄の様な有り様とは打って変わり、目の前に広がるのは、とても長閑な癒し空間だ。*

&nbsp;

Only there, in the dense forest, the sound of water echoed as if from another world.

*鬱蒼とした森の中で、そこだけ別世界のように水の音が響き渡っていた。*

&nbsp;

A waterfall falls in a place that seems to be cut off from its surroundings.

*周りから切り取られた様なその場所では滝が落ちている。*

The waterfall has a drop of about 10 meters and a width of about 20 meters. Because the water falls from a rock that juts out several meters, there is a space behind the waterfall.

*落差は10メートル程、滝幅は20メートル程だろうか、数メートル突き出した岩から水が落ちている為、滝の裏側には空間がある。*

&nbsp;

The falling water is like a silk curtain.

*落ちる水はシルクのカーテンの様だ。*

The space behind the waterfall is large enough for people to pass through.

*滝の裏側の空間は人も十分通れる広さがある。*

&nbsp;

The waterfall itself seems to emit a pale light due to the diffused reflection of sunlight shining through the leaves of the broadleaf trees above the waterfall, hitting the waterfall from both the surface and the back of the waterfall.

*滝の上に茂る広葉樹の葉の間から差し込む陽の光が、滝の表面と裏から当たる乱反射で、滝の水そのものが淡い光を放っているようにも見える。*

&nbsp;

The waterfall basin, where the curtain of water fell, was bubbling and splashing white.

*水のカーテンが落ち込む滝壺は、白く泡立ち飛沫を舞わせていた。*

&nbsp;

Perhaps because the water volume is not as great as it is on the left, the depth is just above a person's knees.

*水量が左程多くは無い為か、深さは人の膝上ほどだ。*

Still, the water was emerald green and shimmering, as if lighting had been applied to the bottom of the water.

*それでも水はエメラルドグリーンに輝き、水底にライティングが施されているが如く、煌めき輝いていた。*

&nbsp;

The waterbody spread out in 20 meter squares, and the river slowly flowed downstream, narrowing in width as it did so.

*水場は20メートル四方に広がり、そのまま川幅が狭まりながらゆっくりと下流へ流れていた。*

The sound of the waterfall, the murmur of the river, the rustle of leaves in the wind, and the occasional bird call.

*滝の音、川のせせらぎ、風に揺れ擦れる木の葉のざわめき、時折聞こえる野鳥の声。*

It is a healing space of negative ion heaven.

*マイナスイオン天国の癒しの空間である。*

&nbsp;

Suzy looks at the cool, sparkling, twinkling and shimmering surface of the water. ......

*スージィは、その清涼なキラキラと瞬いては揺れる水面をみながら……。*

&nbsp;

I know that "Passive Skills" works too. ...... for all jobs! I can't see the status screen, but I wonder what it's like. It's a bit scary, even if it's just a dream. ......

*「『パッシブスキル』も効いてるのは判るんだよねぇ……全職分！ステータス画面見られないけど、どんなことになってんだろ？夢とはいえちょとコワイわ……」*

&nbsp;

A bead of sweat drips down.

*一筋タラリと汗が垂れる。*

&nbsp;

I wish I could do something about being splattered by a single blow, maybe some spare equipment would help ......? Oh, I could use an inventory. ......

*「一撃で飛び散っちゃうのはどうにかしたいなぁ、予備の装備でもあればちっとは……？あ、インベントリ使えるな……」*

&nbsp;

As I became more aware, the possessions in my inventory began to emerge as an image.

*意識すると、インベントリ内の持ち物がイメージとして浮かび上がってきた。*

&nbsp;

Wow, is that a lot?　That's a lot!　This is also for all the characters. ......, I wonder if I had any spare equipment. ...... Huh? Warehouse? Can we use the warehouse too?　Well, I don't think there are any warehouse NPCs around, but ...... is that okay?　Oh, and guild warehouses?　Oh, I see, Suzy is a Guilmouth. But still, I can't get enough of this dream cheat!

*「うおっ！　多い？！！　これも全キャラ分かぁ……、予備装備あったかなぁ……あれ？倉庫？倉庫も使える？！　まぁ倉庫NPCがその辺に居るとは思えないけど……いいのか？　あ、ギルド倉庫もある？　そかスージィはギルマスだったな。にしても、夢チートっパないっすわ！」*

&nbsp;

It turns out that there is even a privately run guild for warehousing to increase storage in the warehouse.

*倉庫の収納を増やす為の、倉庫用個人運営ギルドの分まである事が分った。*

&nbsp;

"If we can use the guild warehouse, we can pull out the equipment for training. ......"

*「ギルド倉庫が使えるなら、育成用の装備が引っ張り出せるな……」*

&nbsp;

I'm like, "Hm?　I have to move it to my inventory to equip it. ......　Swimsuit!

*「ふむ？　一旦インベントリへ移さないと装備できないか……をぉ！！　水着はけんっ！！」*

&nbsp;

With a happy little cry, he got up from the rock, jumped down to the water's edge, and looked down at his reflection in the water mirror.

*そう嬉しげに小さく叫ぶと、岩から立ち上がり水辺に飛び降りて、そのまま水鏡に映る自分の姿を見下ろした。*

Armed in full armor, she was instantly dressed in a white one-piece bathing suit, as if the screen had been switched to a crisp.

*フルアーマーで武装された姿が、カシャリと画面でも切り替わった様に、一瞬で白いワンピースの水着姿になった。*

The cleavage is emphasized, the back is exposed, and the angle of the V-zone is moderately sharp.

*胸の谷間が強調され背中も大きく露出し、Vゾーンの角度も中々際どい。*

&nbsp;

I knew it!　I knew it was possible to change clothes in an instant!　It's a quintessential convenient dream specification!　......But then again, this is a very nice ......"

*「をを！　やっぱり一瞬でお着替え可能か！　流石お便利夢仕様！　……それにしても、これは中々……」*

&nbsp;

She put her hands on her hips, twisted her body from side to side, and let out a sigh of excitement at the sight of her reflection in the water mirror.

*腰に手を当て、左右に身体を捻じらせながら水鏡に映る自分の姿に　ほぉぉ　と感動した様な溜息を洩らした。*

&nbsp;

"Mmm-hmm!　Now, how about this one?"

*「ふむふむ！　さて、コッチはどうかな？」*

&nbsp;

Then the one-piece bathing suit changed, still instantly, to a white micro bikini.

*するとワンピースの水着が、白のマイクロビキニへとやはり一瞬で変わった。*

&nbsp;

'Oh!　That's pretty heinous too!"

*「おぉぅ！　これも結構な凶悪さがありますな！」*

&nbsp;

And then I would happily try various gravure-like poses, such as crossing my arms under my chest and putting my hands behind my head.

*と、嬉しそうに胸の下で腕を組んだり、頭の後ろに手を回したりとグラビア的なポーズを色々してみる。*

&nbsp;

I think this is the best thing about using female characters!　I can dress them up in whatever outfits I want and make them look the way I want them to!　Thanks for the dream!

*「やはり女キャラ使ってるうま味ってコレだよなー！　自分で好きな衣装着せて好きな恰好させられる！　夢よありがとぅぅ！！」*

&nbsp;

He seems to be very satisfied.

*なにやらとても満足気だ。*

&nbsp;

'Aaah!　Could it be!"

*「あぁぁっ！　もしかしてっっ！？」*

&nbsp;

He looked up as if he had noticed something.

*ハッと何かに気が付いた様に顔を上げた。*

&nbsp;

"Does this mean that ...... is going to work by any chance?

*「これはひょっとして……イケルって事でしょか？！！」*

&nbsp;

Suddenly, her swimsuit disappeared and she was in her underwear, just her bra and panties.

*フッと突然水着が消え、ブラとショーツだけの下着姿になった。*

&nbsp;

"After all, if you take off all the equipment, you'll be in your underwear. ......, the question is, ......, where do you start?"

*「やはり装備全部外すと下着になるか……、問題は、……ココからだ」*

&nbsp;

I gulped and swallowed my spit.

*ゴクリと唾を飲み込んだ。*

&nbsp;

She wears a sports-type bra that looks like a tank top.

*身に付けているのは、タンクトップの様なスポーツタイプのブラだ。*

She rolled up her bra in one motion to remove her shirt, revealing a pair of shapely white twin dunes.

*シャツを脱ぐように一気にブラを捲り上げると、ポロリと形の良い白い双丘が露わになった。*

Place the removed bra on the grass nearby.

*外したブラを近くの草の上に置く。*

&nbsp;

I've taken it off!　I took it off!　I got it off!

*「やた！！　脱げたっ！　脱げましたよーー！！！」*

&nbsp;

It's all-out jubilation.

*全力の歓喜の声だ。*

&nbsp;

No - it's like a dream - I'm glad it was a dream - thanks for the dream!"

*「いやーー夢のようだーー夢でよかったーーーー夢よありがとぉぉーーー！」*

&nbsp;

With a voice full of emotion, he wrapped his two palms around the two bulges that could do anything.

*感極まった声を上げながら、両の掌で、何でも出来る二つの膨らみを包み込んだ。*

This is what is known as a "hand bra.

*所謂『手ブラ』と云うヤツだ。*

&nbsp;

'Mmmm, there's at least ......B, right?　......C minus, or something?　...... No!　C!　Let's make it a C!　Estimated C cup!

*「ンむむ……Bくらいはある、よね？　……Cマイナス、とか？　……いや！　Cだな！　Cにしよう！　推定Cカップ！！」*

&nbsp;

I mumbled to myself as if I were trying to convince myself, as I moved my hands around two or three times.

*などと、二度三度と手を動かしながら、思い込むように、言い聞かせる様に呟いた。*

&nbsp;

I'm so glad I didn't choose a character that was so "nasty." I'm really glad I didn't! I'm really glad!"

*「ひんぬーキャラ選ばなくて良かった。ホント良かった！」*

&nbsp;

Something seems to be on the verge of overflowing.

*何かが溢れかけている様だ。*

&nbsp;

"...... one, ...... the next, ...... finally the last bastion ......"

*「……つ、次は……いよいよ最後の砦……」*

&nbsp;

He put his fingers on his shorts and took a deep breath in! Then, as if determined, he took off the last fortress with a mighty slurp!　And then, as if determined, he took off the last fortress with a mighty "slurp!

*そう言いながらショーツに指をかけ、一つ深く息を吸い込むと、カッ！と目を見開き、意を決した様に　ズルリッ！　と勢い良くその最後の砦を脱ぎ降ろした。*

&nbsp;

After taking off her clothes, she takes a serious look at the sole in her hand, inside out and out.

*脱いだ後、手に持ったソレをマジマジと裏を表をと見入ってしまう。*

But then he came to himself and wondered what he was doing.　I put it down on the grass and walked to the water's edge again, my cheeks slightly stained.

*だが直ぐに、ハッと我に返り　何やってんだ自分？　と頬を僅かに染めながら、ソレを草地に置き改めて水辺まで足を進めた。*

&nbsp;

When I was ankle-deep in the water, I looked down at my feet and checked my reflection in the water mirror.

*そのまま足首まで水の中に入った所で足元に目を落とし、水鏡に映る姿を確かめてみる。*

&nbsp;

I'd say she's around 20 years old.　I feel like a college girl. ......?"

*「二十歳前後ってとこかな？　女子大生って感じ……かな？」*

&nbsp;

I muttered to myself as I looked again at my body, which was now unobstructed by anything.

*何も遮るモノの無くなった体を、改めて眺めながら呟いた。*

&nbsp;

Twisting left and right to explore the lines of the body, he reflected his own body on the surface of the water and confirmed that it was his own body.

*身体の線を探る様に、右に左に身を捻りながら自らの身体を水面に映し、それが我が身である事を確認して行った。*

&nbsp;

In time, the consciousness naturally turns downward.

*そのうちに意識が自ずと下方に向いて行く。*

He gulped and spit, and his cheeks seemed to be slightly upturned.

*ゴクリと思わず唾を飲み、頬も多少上気している様だ。*

&nbsp;

"...... Well, this is an area a man can't help but explore ....... We can't just pass by and pretend we didn't see it!"

*「……うむ、ココは男であれば探究せずには済ませられない領域……。見なかった事にして通り過ぎる訳にはいかない！」*

&nbsp;

The hand that had tended to hesitate moves as if determined to do so, and .......

*躊躇いがちだった手が意を決したように動き出す、そして……。*

&nbsp;

......　Nm!　Nmhpahhhhhhhhh?

*「……ふ、ンむ？　ン！　ンむふぱぁはっーーーーーーー？！」*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The murmuring of the clear stream and the gentle calls of wild birds echoed through the area.

*清流のせせらぎと優しげな野鳥の声が響いて行く。*

&nbsp;

Suzy was lying weakly on the grass by the water's edge, breathing very heavily, as if she had just run as fast as she could.

*スージィは水辺に茂る草の上に力なく横たわり、全力疾走した直後の様に呼吸がとても荒い。*

His cheeks are flushed and his whole body is terribly sweaty.

*頬も紅潮し、全身もひどく汗ばんでいる。*

&nbsp;

I'm going to go to "............ Yabbeh!　This is yabba, isn't it?　...... woman yabba ......"

*「…………ヤッベ！　これヤッバくね？　……女ヤッバイ……」*

&nbsp;

His breathing is disorganized and he tries to turn his body sideways to get up, but his arms are not strong enough.

*呼吸が乱れたまま、身体を横に向けて起き上がろうとするが腕に力が入らない。*

I gave up and decided to lie on my back and wait for my breathing to regulate.

*諦めて仰向けになり呼吸が整うのを待つ事にした。*

&nbsp;

He placed his right hand over his heart as if to check for a heartbeat, then got up on his right knee and looked up at the sky.

*鼓動を確かめる様に右手を心臓の上に置き、右膝を立てそのまま空を見上げた。*

&nbsp;

"...... women are awesome. ......"

*「……女ってすんごいなぁ……」*

&nbsp;

He muttered something that sounded like he was deeply moved. I can't tell you what's so great about it.

*何かしみじみと感慨深いとでも言いたげに呟いた。何が凄いのかは詳しく言えない。*

Eventually, his breathing calmed down and his chest, which had been moving up and down, became slower and calmer.

*やがて呼吸も落ち着き、上下していた胸の動きもゆっくりと穏やかになって来た。*

&nbsp;

"....................."

*「…………………」*

&nbsp;

As I come to calm down, my attention is diverted again to something else.

*落ち着いて来ると、また何やら意識がそちらに向いていく。*

When I turned toward it, it started moseying around again and then went to .............

*そちらに向くと、またモゾモゾと動きはじめ、そして…………。*

The sun was already over the top and the afternoon sun was shining.

*もう陽が頂上を越え、午後の日差しを帯びてきた。*

&nbsp;

"..............."

*「……………」*

"......, oh no, ......, let's not go too far... it'll be endless. ......, oh no, ...... ......, let's ...... moderate ...... it ............"

*「……や、やばいよ……程々にしないと…エンドレスに、なっちゃうよ……ヤバいよ……、程々に……しよう…………」*

&nbsp;

They say they do it in moderation.

*程々にやるらしい。*

It seems to have settled down somewhat after various modifications;

*色々修正して、多少落ち着いたかと思われます＾＾；；*
