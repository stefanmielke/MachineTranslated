There is some (?!) erotic content. Please be careful if you are not comfortable with this.

*若干（？）のエチぃ描写がございます。苦手な方はご注意ください。*

&nbsp;

“Hmmmm... what should I do?!”

*「う～むうむうむ！　どうしたもんだろ！？」*

&nbsp;

She furrowed her brows, pursed her lips into a pout, and muttered to herself in a troubled voice.

*眉間を寄せ、むぅ　と口をへの字に曲げて、悩ましげに呟いた。*

&nbsp;

I'm sitting on a large rock by the water's edge.

*今は水辺の大きな岩の上に座っている。*

&nbsp;

I'm sitting with my legs spread wide apart on the rock, and my left hand is resting on the base of my left thigh with my elbow straight.

*岩の上でガッツリと大股を開き、左手は左の腿の付け根に置き肘を張る。*

My right elbow is resting on my right knee, and my chin is resting on my palm.

*右膝に右肘を乗せ掌に顎を乗せていた。*

It's a pose that a girl of my age would do, but it looks like an old man.

*年頃の娘がする佇まいにしてはオッサン臭い。*

Well, the person inside is a 32-year-old man.

*まぁ、中の人は32のオッサンだが。*

&nbsp;

“Even if I say I'm going to try out skill combos, I can't keep doing it because they all blow up at the start...”

*「スキルコンボ試すとか言っても、全部最初に爆ぜちゃうから続かないしなぁ……」*

&nbsp;

While I was trying out skills, I realized something.

*スキルを試し撃ちしているウチに、判った事がある。*

Not only can I use the skills of my current Enchanter job, but I can also use the skills of my sub-jobs and even the skills of other characters I've made with the same account.

*今使っているエンチャンター職のスキルだけでは無く、サブ職は勿論、同じアカウントで作った別のキャラのスキルまで使えるのだ。*

&nbsp;

“This is too much of a cheat!”

*「これってチート過ぎんだろ！」*

&nbsp;

In other words, it means that you can strengthen yourself, and while retaining the toughness and durability of a tanker, you can also become an attacker with attack power and a magic turret, and you can also recover on your own.

*つまり、自己強化可能な上、タンカーの硬さ、耐久力を持ったまま、アタッカーの攻撃力、魔法の砲台にもなって、自力回復も可能という。*

&nbsp;

“It's exactly what I've been dreaming of! Well, it's just a dream, though!”

*「ま・さ・に！　夢の仕様！！　まぁ夢だからねっっ！！！！」*

&nbsp;

Incidentally, as a result of repeatedly testing out the skills while getting carried away, the forest has been badly damaged over a wide area.

*因みに、調子に乗ってスキルの試し撃ちを重ねた結果、森が広範囲で酷い状態になっている。*

&nbsp;

The trees have been knocked down and smashed, and there are large holes all over the ground, with some areas sinking in, others rising up, and others burning or melting.

*木々は薙ぎ倒され砕け、地面のあちこちは大穴が開き、窪んだり盛り上がったり燃えたり融けたりと、どこの戦場だよ！？と云う有様。*

It's a terrible act of destruction to nature.

*大変な自然破壊行為である。*

&nbsp;

It was also discovered that the radar could detect an area with a radius of about 10 kilometers.

*レーダーも、およそ半径10キロほどの範囲が把握できる事が分かった。*

At the moment, there is no Mob activity within a 5-kilometer radius. It is completely dead. It is a death zone.

*今現在、5キロ四方にMobの反応は無い。完全に枯れている。デスゾーンである。*

&nbsp;

In contrast to the hellish state of affairs in the rear, what spreads out before us is a very peaceful and healing space.

*そんな背面の地獄の様な有り様とは打って変わり、目の前に広がるのは、とても長閑な癒し空間だ。*

&nbsp;

Amidst the dense forest, the sound of water echoed as if it were a different world.

*鬱蒼とした森の中で、そこだけ別世界のように水の音が響き渡っていた。*

&nbsp;

In a place that seems to have been cut off from the surrounding area, a waterfall is falling.

*周りから切り取られた様なその場所では滝が落ちている。*

The drop is about 10 meters, and the width of the waterfall is about 20 meters, but because the water is falling from a rock that sticks out a few meters, there is a space behind the waterfall.

*落差は10メートル程、滝幅は20メートル程だろうか、数メートル突き出した岩から水が落ちている為、滝の裏側には空間がある。*

&nbsp;

The water falling looks like a silk curtain.

*落ちる水はシルクのカーテンの様だ。*

The space behind the waterfall is large enough for a person to walk through.

*滝の裏側の空間は人も十分通れる広さがある。*

&nbsp;

The sunlight shining through the leaves of the broad-leaved trees above the waterfall, and the diffuse reflection of the light hitting the surface and back of the waterfall, makes it look as if the water itself is emitting a pale light.

*滝の上に茂る広葉樹の葉の間から差し込む陽の光が、滝の表面と裏から当たる乱反射で、滝の水そのものが淡い光を放っているようにも見える。*

&nbsp;

The basin at the bottom of the waterfall, where the curtain of water falls, was white with bubbles and spray.

*水のカーテンが落ち込む滝壺は、白く泡立ち飛沫を舞わせていた。*

&nbsp;

Perhaps because the volume of water was not that great, the depth was only up to the knees.

*水量が左程多くは無い為か、深さは人の膝上ほどだ。*

Even so, the water sparkled with an emerald green sheen, as if it had been lit from below.

*それでも水はエメラルドグリーンに輝き、水底にライティングが施されているが如く、煌めき輝いていた。*

&nbsp;

The water spread out over an area of 20 meters square, and then slowly flowed downstream as the river narrowed.

*水場は20メートル四方に広がり、そのまま川幅が狭まりながらゆっくりと下流へ流れていた。*

The sound of the waterfall, the babbling of the river, the rustling of the leaves swaying in the wind, and the occasional call of a wild bird.

*滝の音、川のせせらぎ、風に揺れ擦れる木の葉のざわめき、時折聞こえる野鳥の声。*

It was a healing space of negative ions.

*マイナスイオン天国の癒しの空間である。*

&nbsp;

Suzy watches the sparkling, shimmering, rippling surface of the water...

*スージィは、その清涼なキラキラと瞬いては揺れる水面をみながら……。*

&nbsp;

“I know that my ‘passive skills’ are working... for all my jobs! I can't see the status screen, but I wonder what's going on? Even though it's just a dream, it's a little scary...”

*「『パッシブスキル』も効いてるのは判るんだよねぇ……全職分！ステータス画面見られないけど、どんなことになってんだろ？夢とはいえちょとコワイわ……」*

&nbsp;

A single bead of sweat drips down.

*一筋タラリと汗が垂れる。*

&nbsp;

“I'd like to do something about the fact that I get scattered to pieces with a single hit... If I had some spare equipment... Oh, I can use the inventory...”

*「一撃で飛び散っちゃうのはどうにかしたいなぁ、予備の装備でもあればちっとは……？あ、インベントリ使えるな……」*

&nbsp;

When I became aware of it, the items in my inventory appeared as images.

*意識すると、インベントリ内の持ち物がイメージとして浮かび上がってきた。*

&nbsp;

“Whoa, is that a lot? ! Is that for all the characters...? I wonder if there's any spare equipment... Wait, a warehouse? Can I use the warehouse too? Well, I don't think there's a warehouse NPC around... Is that okay? Oh, there's also a guild warehouse? I see, Susie was the guildmaster. Even so, this is a dream cheat!

*「うおっ！　多い？！！　これも全キャラ分かぁ……、予備装備あったかなぁ……あれ？倉庫？倉庫も使える？！　まぁ倉庫NPCがその辺に居るとは思えないけど……いいのか？　あ、ギルド倉庫もある？　そかスージィはギルマスだったな。にしても、夢チートっパないっすわ！」*

&nbsp;

I found out that there is even a personal guild warehouse for increasing the storage capacity of the warehouse.

*倉庫の収納を増やす為の、倉庫用個人運営ギルドの分まである事が分った。*

&nbsp;

“If I can use the guild warehouse, I can pull out the equipment for training...”

*「ギルド倉庫が使えるなら、育成用の装備が引っ張り出せるな……」*

&nbsp;

"Hmm? I have to move it to my inventory first to use it...! I want to wear a swimsuit!”

*「ふむ？　一旦インベントリへ移さないと装備できないか……をぉ！！　水着はけんっ！！」*

&nbsp;

She shouted happily, then stood up from the rock and jumped into the water, looking down at her reflection in the water's surface.

*そう嬉しげに小さく叫ぶと、岩から立ち上がり水辺に飛び降りて、そのまま水鏡に映る自分の姿を見下ろした。*

In an instant, she was wearing a white one-piece swimsuit, as if her appearance in full armor had switched over to the screen with a click.

*フルアーマーで武装された姿が、カシャリと画面でも切り替わった様に、一瞬で白いワンピースの水着姿になった。*

The cleavage was emphasized, her back was exposed, and the angle of the V-zone was quite revealing.

*胸の谷間が強調され背中も大きく露出し、Vゾーンの角度も中々際どい。*

&nbsp;

“Wow, she can change her clothes in an instant after all! As expected of the convenient dream specification! ...But still, this is quite something...”

*「をを！　やっぱり一瞬でお着替え可能か！　流石お便利夢仕様！　……それにしても、これは中々……」*

&nbsp;

She put her hands on her hips and, twisting her body from side to side, she let out a sigh of admiration as she gazed at her reflection in the water mirror.

*腰に手を当て、左右に身体を捻じらせながら水鏡に映る自分の姿に　ほぉぉ　と感動した様な溜息を洩らした。*

&nbsp;

“Hmm, let's see how this one works...”

*「ふむふむ！　さて、コッチはどうかな？」*

&nbsp;

And just like that, the one-piece swimsuit changed into a white micro bikini.

*するとワンピースの水着が、白のマイクロビキニへとやはり一瞬で変わった。*

&nbsp;

"Wow, this one's pretty badass too!

*「おぉぅ！　これも結構な凶悪さがありますな！」*

&nbsp;

She looks happy, and tries out various poses like crossing her arms under her breasts or putting her hands behind her head, like a gravure model.

*と、嬉しそうに胸の下で腕を組んだり、頭の後ろに手を回したりとグラビア的なポーズを色々してみる。*

&nbsp;

“This is what it's like to use a female character! I can dress her up in whatever I like and make her look however I like! Thank you for this dream!“

*「やはり女キャラ使ってるうま味ってコレだよなー！　自分で好きな衣装着せて好きな恰好させられる！　夢よありがとぅぅ！！」*

&nbsp;

She looks very satisfied.

*なにやらとても満足気だ。*

&nbsp;

”Ahhh! Could it be?"

*「あぁぁっ！　もしかしてっっ！？」*

&nbsp;

She looks up as if she has suddenly realized something.

*ハッと何かに気が付いた様に顔を上げた。*

&nbsp;

“Could this mean... that I can do it?!“

*「これはひょっとして……イケルって事でしょか？！！」*

&nbsp;

Suddenly, her swimsuit disappeared and she was left in just her bra and panties.

*フッと突然水着が消え、ブラとショーツだけの下着姿になった。*

&nbsp;

”As I thought, taking off all my equipment leaves me in my underwear... the problem is... starting from here."

*「やはり装備全部外すと下着になるか……、問題は、……ココからだ」*

&nbsp;

She swallowed hard.

*ゴクリと唾を飲み込んだ。*

&nbsp;

The bra she was wearing was a sports-type bra that looked like a tank top.

*身に付けているのは、タンクトップの様なスポーツタイプのブラだ。*

She quickly rolled up the bra as if she was taking off a shirt, and her well-shaped white breasts popped out.

*シャツを脱ぐように一気にブラを捲り上げると、ポロリと形の良い白い双丘が露わになった。*

She placed the bra she had removed on the grass nearby.

*外したブラを近くの草の上に置く。*

&nbsp;

"Yay! I've taken it off! I've taken it off!

*「やた！！　脱げたっ！　脱げましたよーー！！！」*

&nbsp;

It's a cry of joy with all her might.

*全力の歓喜の声だ。*

&nbsp;

“No way, it's like a dream, I'm so glad it's a dream, thank you for the dream!”

*「いやーー夢のようだーー夢でよかったーーーー夢よありがとぉぉーーー！」*

&nbsp;

While letting out a voice full of emotion, she wrapped her two palms around the two bulges that could do anything.

*感極まった声を上げながら、両の掌で、何でも出来る二つの膨らみを包み込んだ。*

It's called a “hand bra”.

*所謂『手ブラ』と云うヤツだ。*

&nbsp;

“Hmm... I think they're about B-cup, right? Or maybe C-minus? No, they're definitely C-cup! Let's say C-cup! Estimated C-cup!“

*「ンむむ……Bくらいはある、よね？　……Cマイナス、とか？　……いや！　Cだな！　Cにしよう！　推定Cカップ！！」*

&nbsp;

She muttered to herself, moving her hands back and forth, as if trying to convince herself.

*などと、二度三度と手を動かしながら、思い込むように、言い聞かせる様に呟いた。*

&nbsp;

”I'm so glad I didn't choose the H-cup character. I'm so glad!”

*「ひんぬーキャラ選ばなくて良かった。ホント良かった！」*

&nbsp;

It seems like something is about to overflow.

*何かが溢れかけている様だ。*

&nbsp;

“Next time... finally the last bastion...”

*「……つ、次は……いよいよ最後の砦……」*

&nbsp;

While saying this, he put his fingers on his shorts, took a deep breath, and then, with his eyes wide open, he made up his mind and quickly pulled down his last bastion.

*そう言いながらショーツに指をかけ、一つ深く息を吸い込むと、カッ！と目を見開き、意を決した様に　ズルリッ！　と勢い良くその最後の砦を脱ぎ降ろした。*

&nbsp;

After taking it off, he stared at it in his hands, examining the underside.

*脱いだ後、手に持ったソレをマジマジと裏を表をと見入ってしまう。*

But then he snapped out of it and asked himself, “What am I doing?”, blushing slightly as he put it down on the grass and walked to the water's edge.

*だが直ぐに、ハッと我に返り　何やってんだ自分？　と頬を僅かに染めながら、ソレを草地に置き改めて水辺まで足を進めた。*

&nbsp;

I dipped my feet into the water up to my ankles, and looked down at my feet to check my reflection in the water.

*そのまま足首まで水の中に入った所で足元に目を落とし、水鏡に映る姿を確かめてみる。*

&nbsp;

“I guess I'm around twenty years old? I look like a college girl, don't I?”

*「二十歳前後ってとこかな？　女子大生って感じ……かな？」*

&nbsp;

I muttered to myself as I looked at my body again, which was now unobstructed.

*何も遮るモノの無くなった体を、改めて眺めながら呟いた。*

&nbsp;

As if exploring the lines of her body, she twisted her body from side to side, reflecting her body in the water and confirming that it was her own body.

*身体の線を探る様に、右に左に身を捻りながら自らの身体を水面に映し、それが我が身である事を確認して行った。*

&nbsp;

Before long, her consciousness naturally turned downward.

*そのうちに意識が自ずと下方に向いて行く。*

She gulped involuntarily and her cheeks seemed to be flushed a little.

*ゴクリと思わず唾を飲み、頬も多少上気している様だ。*

&nbsp;

“Well, this is a place that no man can pass without exploring... I can't just pretend I didn't see it and walk on!“

*「……うむ、ココは男であれば探究せずには済ませられない領域……。見なかった事にして通り過ぎる訳にはいかない！」*

&nbsp;

His hesitant hand starts to move as if he has made up his mind, and...

*躊躇いがちだった手が意を決したように動き出す、そして……。*

&nbsp;

”Hmm? Nn! Nmuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh

*「……ふ、ンむ？　ン！　ンむふぱぁはっーーーーーーー？！」*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The sound of a gentle bird and the babbling of a clear stream can be heard in the distance.

*清流のせせらぎと優しげな野鳥の声が響いて行く。*

&nbsp;

Suzy lies helplessly on the grass by the water's edge, breathing very heavily as if she had just run as fast as she could.

*スージィは水辺に茂る草の上に力なく横たわり、全力疾走した直後の様に呼吸がとても荒い。*

Her cheeks were flushed and her whole body was covered in sweat.

*頬も紅潮し、全身もひどく汗ばんでいる。*

&nbsp;

“Oh no! This is bad, isn't it? This woman is bad...”

*「…………ヤッベ！　これヤッバくね？　……女ヤッバイ……」*

&nbsp;

Her breathing was still erratic, and she tried to turn over onto her side and get up, but she couldn't muster the strength in her arms.

*呼吸が乱れたまま、身体を横に向けて起き上がろうとするが腕に力が入らない。*

She gave up and rolled over onto her back and waited for her breathing to return to normal.

*諦めて仰向けになり呼吸が整うのを待つ事にした。*

&nbsp;

I placed my right hand on my heart to check my pulse, and then raised my right knee and looked up at the sky.

*鼓動を確かめる様に右手を心臓の上に置き、右膝を立てそのまま空を見上げた。*

&nbsp;

“Women are amazing...”

*「……女ってすんごいなぁ……」*

&nbsp;

I muttered to myself, as if I was trying to express my deep and heartfelt feelings. I can't say exactly what was so amazing.

*何かしみじみと感慨深いとでも言いたげに呟いた。何が凄いのかは詳しく言えない。*

Eventually, her breathing calmed down and the movement of her chest, which had been rising and falling, slowly became gentle.

*やがて呼吸も落ち着き、上下していた胸の動きもゆっくりと穏やかになって来た。*

&nbsp;

“…………………”

*「…………………」*

&nbsp;

As she calmed down, her consciousness began to drift towards that place again.

*落ち着いて来ると、また何やら意識がそちらに向いていく。*

As she turned towards that place, she began to squirm again, and then...

*そちらに向くと、またモゾモゾと動きはじめ、そして…………。*

The sun has already passed the peak and is now shining in the afternoon.

*もう陽が頂上を越え、午後の日差しを帯びてきた。*

&nbsp;

"……………”

*「……………」*

“It's bad... we have to stop... it'll go on forever... it's bad... let's stop...

*「……や、やばいよ……程々にしないと…エンドレスに、なっちゃうよ……ヤバいよ……、程々に……しよう…………」*

&nbsp;

It seems like they're going to stop.

*程々にやるらしい。*



&nbsp;

----------------

I've made various corrections, and I think it's calmed down a little ^^;

*色々修正して、多少落ち着いたかと思われます＾＾；；*
