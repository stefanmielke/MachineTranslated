## 108話　領事館へのご招待

Just in time to jump in!

*ギリギリ飛び込みーーー(>ω<)*

&nbsp;

We have made a few minor additions and corrections.

*チョイとばかり加筆、修正いたしました。*


----------------

&nbsp;

The Amcam Consulate is about 30 minutes by horse-drawn carriage from the school.

*アムカム領事館は、学園から馬車に揺られて30分程の所にある。*

On this day, in addition to us freshmen, Colin and AnnaMarie came with us, so there were seven of us in total.

*この日は、わたし達新一回生の他に、コリンとアンナメリーが付いて来てくれたので、総勢7名での訪問となった。*

&nbsp;

When I arrived at the consulate, my uncle, aunt, and Annie greeted me immediately.

*領事館に着くと、叔父様、叔母様、そしてアニーが直ぐに出迎えてくれた。*

Annie had Colin with her, so she was very excited to have a sleepover with everyone.

*アニーは、コリンも一緒だったので、みんなでのお泊りに、凄いはしゃぎっぷりだった。*

Surrounded by a large number of customers, they looked happy from start to finish, which was very cute and appropriate for their age.

*大勢のお客さんに囲まれて、始終楽しそうにしているのが、年相応でとても可愛らしい。*

&nbsp;

The dinner that night was a meat-based meal, which was kindly prepared by my aunt, as all the guests were growing up.

*この日のディナーは、皆育ち盛りばかりだと云う事で、叔母様のご配慮もあり、肉料理中心の物だった。*

The beef, pork, chicken and lamb roasts were all excellent! The enthusiasm and care of the head chef of the house came through perfectly!

*ビーフ、ポーク、チキンや仔山羊のローストは、どれも絶品だった！お屋敷の料理長の意気込みと心遣いが、バッチリと伝わって来た！*

Irving and Lombardo's boys were devouring the food, or at least drinking it. They were devouring the food with such gusto that I thought they were drinking it.

*アーヴィン、ロンバートの男子達が、貪る様に、それこそ、飲んでるんじゃね？って勢いで平らげる。*

Bibi and Mia were also putting away the food quite as fast as the two of them.

*ビビやミアも、二人に負けない結構な勢いで食材を片付けていた。*

However, I am reminded once again of how great she is, because even though she dares to be such a healthy daredevil, she is still a refined young lady in her dining manners.

*しかしビビってば、そんな健啖ぶりを見せながらも、食事の所作はお上品なお嬢様なのだから、実に大したものだと改めて思ってしまうよ。*

I am not lagging behind everyone else, but I am enjoying the food as well!

*ま、わたしも皆に後れを取る事無く、美味しく頂いている訳ではあるんですけどね！*

I knew the people of Amkam were carnivorous to the core, I bet!

*やっぱアムカムの民は、根っからの肉食系なんだね、きっと！！*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When I told her about Irving's duel over dinner, her uncle leaned forward with a 'ho-ho-ho,' her aunt laughed and said 'a la la la, oh well,' and Annie listened with a twinkle in her eye.

*食事をしながらアーヴィンの決闘の話をすれば、叔父様は『ほほう』と身を乗り出し、叔母様は『アラアラ、まあまあ』と笑い、アニーは目を輝かせて聞き入っていた。*

Furthermore, Bibi publicly announced that I had become the largest faction of first-year students!

*更にはビビが、わたしが一回生の最大派閥になったと公言しやがった！*

Even when I pleaded with her to stop, Bibi's mouth would not stop, and even Mia and Irving and the others joined in to stir things up!

*わたしが、やめてくれーっと懇願しても、ビビの口は止まらず、それどころか、ミアやアーヴィン達まで一緒になって煽って来る始末！*

My uncles praised me, saying, "That's great! but I couldn't stop my face from burning.

*叔父様達には「流石だ」「凄いわ！」と称賛されていたが、わたしは顔の火照りが止まらない。*

And even more! If word got out that she was friends with Master Carrie as well, Annie would say, "Great! That's great!" and she shouts all over the place.

*更に、更に！キャリー様とも友達になったと伝われば、アニーが「凄い！凄い！」と声をあげまくる。*

It seems that Carrie's fame is well-known among Annie and the other children in the elementary school. I knew it was Carrie-sama who was great, right?

*どうやらアニー達、初等舎の子達にも、キャリー様の勇名は轟いているらしい。やっぱ凄いのはキャリー様だよ、ねぇ？*

&nbsp;

Well, that's how we talked about what was going on over dinner.

*まぁ、そんな感じでわたし達は、食事をしながら近況報告をしていったのだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sister?"

*「姉御？」*

Oh, you mean Mrs. Colette of the Bear Trading Company."

*「ああ、ベア商会のコレット夫人の事だね」*

You know about this?

*「ご存じなのです、か？」*

Oh, the Bear Trading Company is one of the big trading companies that run the river port workers," she said. Colette is the wife of the president of the Bear Trading Company. She is a dashing woman who is capable of using a large number of men at her command.

*「ああ、ベア商会は河港で働く人夫を仕切る、大手の商会の一つだよ。コレットはベア商会の社長夫人だ。女だてらに大勢の男共を使い熟す、威勢のいい女傑だよ」*

"I see, you are a 'landlady' of sorts, aren't you?"

*「なるほど、『女将さん』的な方なのです、ね？」*

Well, is that about right?"

*「まあ、そんなとこか？」*

Colette hates being called 'landlady,' much less 'Mrs.,' with all her heart."

*「コレットは『女将さん』とか、ましてや『夫人』なんて呼ばれるのは心底嫌がるからね」*

So you're a "big sister," huh?

*「それで『姉御』です、か」*

&nbsp;

I'm in trouble, ha ha ha," my uncle chuckled cheerfully. I see. It seems that there are some people at Irving's place of business who are quite strong characters.

*「困ったものだよね、ハッハッハ」と、叔父様は朗らかな笑い声を上げられた。なるほど。アーヴィンの仕事先には、相当キャラが濃い人が居るらしい。*

It is said that once, in front of Irving and his friends, a large group of laborers had a slight misunderstanding and almost got into a big fight. However, the men were so shocked that they dropped their fists in the air. ......

*何でも一度アーヴィン達の前で、大勢の人夫達がちょっとした行き違いから、大喧嘩になりそうになった時があったそうだ。しかし、そこへやって来た『コレット姉御』の一喝で、男達はオズオズと振り上げた拳を下ろしてしまったとか……。*

&nbsp;

It was intimidating. That was as much pressure as Aria."

*「あの時の威圧感は凄かった。アレはアリア並みのプレッシャーだった」*

&nbsp;

Irving says so, and Lombardo nods his head in agreement. That's great "Sister" .......

*そう言うアーヴィンの言葉に、ロンバートもウンウンと頷いている。凄ぇな『姉御』……。*

&nbsp;

According to what I heard, when Irving and his colleagues first went to work at this Collette sister's place, they got tangled up with some senior workers at the stuffing station there. ......

*聞いた話によると、アーヴィン達、このコレット姉御の所に初めて仕事に行った時、そこの詰所で先輩労働者達に絡まれたそうで……。*

Because he was wearing the uniform of the school, he was told "Oi oi oi, this is not a place for a monk," or "You can't do anything here with such thin arms," and he was laughed at.

*学園の制服を着てたから、「オイオイ、ここはお坊ちゃんの来るとこじゃねぇぜ」とか「そんな細腕じゃ、ここでは何も出来ねぇぜ」とか言われて、せせら笑われたそうな。*

Well, no one would look at Lombardo and say he has "slender arms," but Irving is a relatively small man, so he probably looked slender when he was standing alongside Lombardo.

*まあ、流石にロンバートを見て、『細腕』とか言うヤツは居ないだろうけど、アーヴィンって比較的小柄な方だから、ロンバートと並んでいれば華奢に見えたのかもね。*

&nbsp;

She looks like that, but she is surprisingly muscular. ......, says Bibi, but .......

*ああ見えて、意外と筋肉質なんだけど……、とビビさんは仰ってますけれど……。*

How do you know all that? I don't dare to poke my nose into it, though! I feel like I'd lose if I did!

*なんでアンタそんな事知ってんのさ？！あえてツッ込まないけどね！ツッ込んだら負けな気がするからね！！*

&nbsp;

Then, when I went to ask where the supervisor was, I heard that someone had stepped out into the aisle and tried to catch Irving's foot.

*そんで詰所で監督の居る場所聞こうとしたら、通路に足出して来て、アーヴィンの足を引っかけようとした奴がいたらしい。*

Irving said, "I kicked the guy's leg out of the way," he said.

*ンで、そいつの足を「邪魔だから思い切り蹴り飛ばしてやった」とアーヴィンさんは仰った。*

As a matter of course, a brawl broke out afterwards, but Irving and his team, as a matter of course, overpowered the brawl.

*当然の様に、その後乱闘になったらしいんだけど、アーヴィン達ってばこれまた当然の様に、これを制圧してしまったそうな。*

&nbsp;

What the hell is this guy doing? Davis, you were with him, weren't you? What the hell are you doing, bringing other people into it, too?

*全く何やってくれてンのよこの人はっ！デイビス君も一緒だった筈だよね？他所の人まで、巻き込んじゃって何やってんのさ！*

&nbsp;

No. Danny's a real piece of work, isn't he? Danny's a real piece of work, isn't he?"

*「いや！ダニーの奴も、やっぱ中々やるぜ？」*

&nbsp;

He's so happy to see me that he's worried about me! Even Lombard is grumbling!

*わたしの心配を他所に、そんな風に楽しそうに言って来やがるし！ロンバートまでウンウンしてるし？！*

At the end of the fight, he says he and Mr. Davis were smiling and saying to each other, "You're good!" and they were knocking each other's fists. and then they smiled at each other and said, "You're good!" ...... Davis, you, too?

*粗方ぶっ倒した最後には、デイビス君と「やるな！」とか言いながら、いい笑顔で互いの拳をコツンと当て合ったと言うてるし……デイビス君、君もか？！*

Yada, yada, yada, these fighting people. ......

*ヤダよ、やだよこの戦闘民族ども……。*

Eventually, afterwards, I heard that even those rough people recognized me, opened up to me, and we became friends. ......, what are you doing, really!

*結局その後、その荒くれな人達にも認められて、打ち解けて、仲良くなったらしいんだけど……、何やってんでしょホント！！*

And then, when "Sister Colette" hears that you've been fighting with these ruffians, she likes you for your courage and prowess, and loves you?

*そんでもって、そんな荒くれ共と渡り合ったって話を聞き付けた『コレット姉御』に、その度胸と腕っぷしを気に入られ、可愛がられているって事？*

&nbsp;

What, what is that ironclad development? The promise that we couldn't meet at the Adventurers' Guild was hidden in the middle of nowhere? This is the strength of a man with heroic attributes, isn't it?

*なによ、なにさ、その鉄板展開はっ！冒険者組合で出会え無かったお約束が、そんなトコに隠れてたって事ぉ？！コレがヒーロー属性持ってるヤツの、引きの強さって事ぉ？！！*

Oh my god! I'm kind of intensely jealous!

*もう！なんだか激しくジェラシっちゃうんですけどぉ！！*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I'll visit Colette tomorrow for the first time in a long time. I'll visit Colette tomorrow for the first time in a long time, after having tea at Susie's before noon.

*「コレットの所にも、久しぶりに明日、顔を出して見るとしよう。昼前にスージィの所でお茶を頂いた後で、だけどね」*

&nbsp;

As he said this, my uncle turned to me as if he was playing a trick on me and showed me one of his eyes meditating.

*そう言いながら叔父様は、悪戯でもするかの様にわたしに向け、片目を瞑って見せた。*

Ofu...... that means everyone is coming to the store tomorrow.

*おふ……明日、皆んなでお店に来るって事ね。*

I'm kind of nervous!

*なんか緊張しちゃうのよさ！*

&nbsp;

◇

&nbsp;

After a sumptuous dinner, my uncle said he had a story to tell, so we all moved to a different room to hear it.

*豪華な夕食を頂いた後、叔父様がお話があると仰るので、お部屋を移して皆んなお話を伺う事になった。*

&nbsp;

I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you.

*「すまないね、報告するまでに、随分時間がかかってしまった」*

You mean the bandits we captured?

*「捕まえた賊の事ですね？！」*

&nbsp;

After taking a sip of tea made by the house maid, my uncle slowly opened his mouth.

*お屋敷のメイドさんが淹れてくれたお茶を一口頂いた後、叔父様が徐に口を開かれた。*

When Bibi responded to his uncle's words as if he had expected it, his uncle nodded his head and said, "Oh, yes.

*その叔父様のお言葉に、予想をしていたと言う様にビビが返すと、叔父様も「ああ、そうだ」と大きく頷かれた。*

&nbsp;

According to my uncle's story, those guys were some kind of street gang that had their roots in the slums of De Kembel.

*叔父様のお話しではあの連中は、デケンベルのスラムを根城にしている、ストリートギャングみたいな一団だったそうだ。*

My uncle said it took a long time to identify them because they were not affiliated with any large organization and were working in different groups.

*何処か大きな組織に所属している訳でも無く、グループ毎に動いている奴等なので、特定するのに時間がかかったと叔父様は仰る。*

In short, they were like a "semi-greater" group, right?

*要するに、『半グレ』みたいな連中だっだって事かな？*

It sure looked badass, didn't it?

*確かに、タチは悪そうだったもんね。*

&nbsp;

"They were on their way back from taking a shipment to the city of Immedio, and that's when they got into this.

*「奴らは、インメディオに荷を運んだ帰りに、今回の事に及んだと言う事だ」*

&nbsp;

What's with that "Let's go hunting a little while you're running an errand? What's with that "Let's go hunting a little while I'm running an errand" kind of attitude?

*なんだその「お使いついでに、ちょいとひと狩り行っとく？」みたいなノリは？！*

You say it's such a light motive?

*そんな軽い動機だってか？！*

They're seriously the worst of the worst!

*マジで最悪な連中だわよ！*

&nbsp;

I was carrying a load of ...... "Have you ever heard of the name 'Backdoor'?"

*「運んでいた荷なのだが……『バックドア』、という名を聞いた事はあるかね？」*

"Is this Bakudoa ......?"

*「ばっくどあ……です、か？」*

I'm guessing you're referring to the magic potion that's been circulating on ...... lately!"

*「……最近出回っているという、魔法薬の事でしょうか？！」*

Yes, you knew very well."

*「そうだ、良く知っていたね」*

No, I only know the name , but I don't know much about it! I only know the name ......, I don't know the details!"

*「いえ！名前だけは……、詳しい事は存じておりません！」*

&nbsp;

That's great Bibi, and your uncle says, "It's a big deal just to know your name.

*凄いなビビは、叔父様も「名前を知っているだけでも、大した物だ」と仰っている。*

&nbsp;

As you know, legitimate magic potions are controlled by alchemists. However, such unauthorized products, which are not controlled by alchemists, are full of unknown side effects.

*「知っての通り、本来、正規の魔法薬と言う物は、錬金術師の手により管理されている物だ。だが、錬金術師に管理されていない、このような非正規品には、どのような副作用が隠されているか分からない代物ばかりだ」*

&nbsp;

Maybe an alchemist is treated like a "pharmacist" in the original world.

*錬金術師っていうのは、元の世界で言う『薬剤師』みたいな扱いなのかもしれないね。*

And, according to my uncle, this "backdoor" is a magic potion sold through black market channels that has rapidly become available in the last six months or so.

*そんで、叔父様が仰るにこの『バックドア』って代物は、闇ルートで販売されている魔法薬で、ここ半年ほどで急速に出回り始めた物らしい。*

&nbsp;

Magic potions are, in short, things that intrude on my (enchanter's) work, such as "healing potions" that heal wounds and "magic potions" that restore some magic power, as well as things that temporarily increase attack power by boosting physical strength and stamina, or increase magic power by boosting magical power. I'm talking about those things that come into my (enchanter's) business! Hmmm..!

*魔法薬って言うのは要するに、傷を治す『ヒーリングポーション』や、魔力を幾らか回復させる『マジックポーション』などを筆頭に、一時、体力や膂力を底上げして攻撃力を高めたり、魔力を底上げして魔法の威力を高めたりと、言って見ればわたしの（エンチャラーの）仕事に踏み込んでくるシロモノたちの事だわさ！フーーンんっだ！*

&nbsp;

The back door is said to increase the strength of the muscles and magic at the same time, and even those who have no magic power can use magic for a short period of time. However, the side effects are also quite severe, and there have already been a considerable number of victims.

*「この『バックドア』は、これ一つで膂力、魔力も同時に高め、本来魔力の無い者にでも、その一時だけ魔法が使えるとまで言われている。だが、その副反応もかなり激しく、既に相当数の犠牲者が出ているのが実情だ」*

&nbsp;

My uncle says that the number of victims in the last six months has already exceeded three figures. The victims ...... are those who lost their lives, that is to say.

*叔父様は、この半年での犠牲者は、既に三桁を超えていると仰っている。犠牲者……つまり、命を落とされた方、と云う事だ。*

&nbsp;

"Is such ...... a dangerous thing, huh?"

*「そんな……、危険な物なのです、か？」*

That's what they were dealing with?

*「それを連中が扱っていたと？！」*

That's what I'm talking about.

*「そういう事だ」*

&nbsp;

I have a feeling that the conversation is getting a lot louder!

*なんだか、話が随分大きくなって来た気がしるよ！*

What kind of super development is it when you catch an extortionist and he turns out to be a drug trafficker?

*恐喝犯捕まえたら、麻薬の密売人だったっとか、一体どんな超展開よ？！！*

They weren't just a bunch of thugs, though, were they?

*アイツ等、ただタチが悪いチンピラってだけじゃなかったって事でつか！*

&nbsp;

The interrogator recorded that they used a 'back door' themselves, so they didn't hesitate to commit the crimes. The interrogator recorded that they had no hesitation in committing the crimes.

*「奴らは、自分達でも『バックドア』を使っていたそうだ。その為、犯行に及ぶ事にも躊躇いが無かったのだろうと、取調官が記録に残している」*

&nbsp;

The drug Backdoor is said to elevate the user's state of mind and numb his or her sense of ethics.

*『バックドア』って薬物は、使用者の精神状態を高揚させ、倫理観をも麻痺させるそうだ。*

Moreover, my uncle told me that it was a dangerous drug that was highly addictive and surely destructive to both the body and the mind.

*しかも依存性も高く、確実に身体も精神も破壊する、危険な薬物だと叔父様は仰った。*

No! It's definitely a bad drug, isn't it? Seriously, it's a bad idea to have such a drug on the market, isn't it?

*いや！確実にヤバいお薬ですよねっ？！マジでそんな薬物、出回ってはマズイですよね？！！*

&nbsp;

Then! They will be subjected to even harsher interrogations, followed by harsher punishments?

*「では！連中には更に厳しい取調と、その後に厳罰が下されるのですね？！」*

&nbsp;

Bibi asked his uncle about the future treatment of the guys.

*ビビが、連中の今後の処遇について叔父様に尋ねた。*

Well, I guess Bibi is right, there will be more severe interrogation. Even though he was a courier, he was involved in such a dangerous drug, and I think the people who maintain public safety would want to pursue even the source of the drug.

*まあビビの言う通り、更に厳しい取調があるんだろうね。運び屋とはいえ、そんな危険薬物に関わったんだから、治安を維持する側からしたら、その出所迄も追求したい事だと思う。*

In this world, they still interrogate criminals in a torturous manner, so I guess I'm sorry to hear that. Well, they got what they deserved.

*この世界では、未だ罪人に、拷問じみた事して取調するらしいから、ご愁傷様ってトコかな？ま、自業自得だしね。*

&nbsp;

That's the thing. ......"

*「その事なんだがね……」*

&nbsp;

My uncle, exhaling deeply, leaned his body against the back of the chair, wrinkled his brow deeply, and looked as if he was in some difficulty.

*叔父様はそう言うと、深く息を吐きながら椅子の背にその身体を預け、眉根に深く皺を寄せながら、何やら難しそうなお顔をなさった。*

&nbsp;

Is there a problem?

*「何か問題が、あるのです、か？」*

It was three days before ....... After all of them had been interrogated. ............ all of them died of illness."

*「……三日前の事だ。全員、一通りの取り調べが終わった後だ。…………全員病死したそうだ」*

"...... yes?"

*「……はい？」*

"Three days ago, in the early morning of the 11th day of the 5th lunar month, it was officially announced that 17 perpetrators, three prison guards, and two interrogators had died from illness. It was officially announced that 17 perpetrators, 3 jail guards, and 2 interrogators, a total of 22 people, had died of illness.

*「三日前の『5の蒼月11日』未明。実行犯17名と、牢番3名及び、取調官2名、合計22名が病死したと公式発表された」*

「「「「「 Huh?!!!」」」」」

*「「「「「はぁあっ？！！」」」」」*

&nbsp;

Nah! What? Hey, what the heck?

*な！な？な、なんですとーーーっ？！*

My uncle threw down the stack of papers he was carrying on the table and started rubbing his wrinkled brow.

*叔父様は、吐き捨てる様にそう言うと、持っていた書類の束をテーブルの上に投げ捨て、皺の寄った眉間を揉み始めてしまった。*

&nbsp;

Disturbing! It's too disturbing! Uncle?

*不穏！不穏過ぎますですわよ！叔父様？！！*

All the murderers, and even the guards for that matter, died of illness at the same time? That's impossible, isn't it? What? This stench of conspiracy!

*犯人全員と、それどころか衛士の方達まで同時に病死？！あり得ませんよね？！何？この陰謀臭さ！！*

&nbsp;

......Uncle dropped a huge bomb on us at the end of the day. ......

*……叔父様ってば、最後にすンごい爆弾投下してくれたワ……あふ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

◇◇◇◇◇

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Geez, I'm not sure I'm ready for this! That's why you have a bruise, Reilly? That's not good, is it? Ha-ha-ha!

*「ぎゃははは！それで青痣かよレイリー？！ざまねぇな？！ぎゃはは！」*

Shut up and shut up, Parker!"

*「うるせぇ黙れパーカー！」*

"Lurie, did you just stand there and watch?"

*「ルゥリィ、アンタも黙って見てたワケ？」*

I can't help it! There's no way I'm going to be among those people!"

*「しょうがないじゃない！あんな連中の中になんか入れるワケ無いじゃん！！」*

"Wow, ......, the daughter of the mayor of Notos says some pretty sweet things, huh? Aha!"

*「へぇ……、ノトス市長の娘が、随分しおらしい事言うじゃん！アハ！」*

Even Katia knows that no matter how old the nobility is, they can't challenge the still powerful dukes, can they?

*「いくら旧貴族だって、未だ強い力を持つ公爵家になんか、楯突けるわけ無いってカティアだって分かるでしょう？！！」*

&nbsp;

It was a weekend afternoon. In a corner of a downtown café terrace, four men and four women were sitting at a table facing the street, talking noisily without paying attention to their surroundings.

*週末の午後。繁華街にあるカフェテラスの一角で、男女4人が通りに面したテーブル座り、周りの目も気にせず騒々しく会話をしていた。*

&nbsp;

One pair of men and women were wearing the uniforms of Milia Castel Eye, which is well-known to everyone in this town, but they looked somewhat out of place compared to the existing uniforms.

*一組の男女は、この街の者なら知らぬ者など居ない、ミリアキャステルアイの制服を着ていたが、既存の物と比べると、幾分着崩している感がある。*

The other pair, a man and a woman, are wearing clothes from a school known for its moderate quality, but they are so disheveled that one can hardly recognize their original attire. The female student wears so much make-up that one would think she was in the nightlife business.

*もう一組の男女が着ている物は、中程度で知られる学舎の物だが、此方は元の装いが判らぬほどに着崩されている。更に女生徒の方は、夜の商売をしているのかと言うほどに化粧が濃い。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"...... Oi, it's time to go."

*「……オイ、そろそろ時間だぞ」*

"Hmm? Already? You can't even slow down!"

*「んン？もう？！ろくにゆっくりも出来ないじゃない！」」*

What, it's not even three o'clock yet?"

*「何よ、まだ3時にもなってないわよ？」*

You're back early.

*「随分早いご帰還だな」*

We had no choice, our curfew has been shortened. ......

*「仕方ねぇんだよ、俺様達の門限が短くされててな……」*

Haha! Is that the pena that caused all the commotion?!"

*「ははっ！騒ぎを起こしたペナか？！」*

"...... tch."

*「……チッ」*

&nbsp;

I'm going back today, you guys! I'm going back to the store, you guys!

*「しょうがないから、今日はもう戻るけど、アンタ達！店の方、頼んだわよ！」*

Wait a minute! We can't afford such a fancy restaurant!"

*「ちょっと待ってよ！あんな高級店、あたしらの小遣いじゃ入れやしないわよ！」*

Yeah? Tsk! I can't help it. ......, that should be enough, right?"

*「ええ？！チッ！しょうがないわね……、これで足りるでしょ？」*

Oi! Let's go!"

*「オイ！行くぞ！」*

Oh, wait! Then it's because I asked you to!"

*「あ、待ってよ！じゃ、頼んだからだからね！」*

&nbsp;

See you later.

*「あいよーまたなー」*

&nbsp;

The man and woman remaining at the table waved to them as they left, smiling frivolously.

*テーブルに残った男女が、軽薄そうな笑顔で、去って行く二人に手を振った。*

&nbsp;

"Heh! He left three large silver coins in a heap."

*「へっ！大銀貨3枚、ゴロッと置いて行きやがった」*

"How dare you drop a 750c on me with impunity, ......!"

*「750cを平気で寄こすとか……、どんだけよ！」*

&nbsp;

The two men retracted their previous smiles as if they were lying and flicked their fingers at the large silver coin on the table with cold expressions.

*2人は、それまでの笑顔を嘘の様に引っ込めて、冷めた表情でテーブルの上の大銀貨を指で弾いた。*

A female student, called Katia, lazily put her cheek on the table, fiddled with a silver coin with the fingertip of one hand, and muttered, "Whatever," to the man.

*カティアと呼ばれていた女生徒が、気怠げにテーブルに頬を付け、片手の指先で銀貨をもてあそび「どうでも良いんだけどさ」と呟きながら、男の方へと声をかけた。*

&nbsp;

"...... Reilly, you know, you used to say big things about Zuibn, but ...... actually, what's the big deal?"

*「……レイリーってさ、昔はズイブン大きな事いってたけど……実は、大した事無いの？」*

You said, "............ No, you're strong. I don't know about that Grouse Mill County thing, though. At least he was stronger than me, right?"

*「…………いや、強ぇだろ。グルースミル郡一とか言ってたのは、どうか知らねぇけどな。少なくとも、俺よりは強かったぜ？」*

What?" Really? But he said it was a blow. ......"

*「え？そうなの？でも、一撃だったって……」*

The most popular and most popular of all the "elite" from all over the state of Calais are gathered here in Milia Castellai. It's no wonder there's a Bakemon or two in there.

*「そりゃさ、カライズ州の全てからエリート様が集う、天下のミリアキャステルアイだぜ？バケモンの一人や二人、居てもおかしくねぇだろ？」*

Hah ......, well, I guess you're right."

*「はぁ……、まあ、そうなんだろうけどさ」*

&nbsp;

Katya let out a sigh of resignation, perhaps satisfied with the answer of the male student called Parker.

*パーカーと呼ばれていた男子生徒の答えに、納得したのか、諦めた様な嘆息をカティアが零した。*

&nbsp;

I'm more interested in the question, "Did you pass last week's exam?"

*「それより、お前、先週の試験受かったのかよ？」*

'...... fell out! Darn! This is my third ...... in a row! Next time I'll carve a spiritual seal on it!"

*「……落ちたわよ！ちっ！これで3回連続……！次こそは霊印刻んでやるわよ！」*

'Well, why don't you just do your best and get it engraved by the time you graduate? After all, more than half of the people in the world can't even handle magic properly! The fact that you can use magic, albeit only a little, is enough to make you one foot on the side of the elite! Heh!

*「ふん、まあ頑張って卒業までに刻めりゃ良いんじゃねぇのか？なんせ世の中の人間の半分以上は、魔力すらまともに扱えねぇんだ！魔法が少しばかりとはいえ使えるだけ、お前も充分エリート様側に片足ツッコんでるよ！へっ！」*

"...... but they already said they were going to carve the spirit seal the day after the entrance ceremony, right?"

*「……でもさ、アイツらはさ、入学式の翌日にはもう、霊印刻んだって言ってたよね」*

...... yeah, you said it."

*「……ああ、言ってたな」*

I'm like, "Screw it! I think!"

*「ふっざけんな！って思うわよ！」*

I'm telling you, they are genuine elitists! I told you they are genuine elitists! Well, I don't care. They drop money for us like this. I'm grateful for it!

*「だからよ！アイツらは生粋のエリート様だって言ってんじゃねぇかよ！ま、構わねぇさ。こうやって、わざわざ駄賃を落としてくれるんだ。有難く頂だこうぜ！」*

I'm sure you're right. If you play it just right, the lady will give you a little money on her own!

*「ふん、そうね。適当に相手してりゃ、お嬢様が勝手に小金をバラ撒いてくれるしね！」*

I'll be right there! Just like that, just like that! Ha-ha-ha!"

*「そうそ！適当にな、適当に！ひははは！」*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"What is it? You're talking about something that sounds pretty good, aren't you?

*「なんだなんだ？随分景気が良さそうな話してンじゃねぇか？」*

Ah! Fluke!

*「あ！フルーク！！」*

This is Fluke's brother. Heh, heh, heh. I've got a little something for you.

*「こりゃフルークの兄ぃ、へへ、ちょいとありましてね」*

&nbsp;

Suddenly, a man approached the two on the café terrace from the street side.

*突然、カフェテラスの2人に、通り側から声をかけて来た男がいた。*

The man, called Fluke, dropped his buttocks into the chair next to Katia's and hugged her shoulders, as he should have.

*フルークと呼ばれたその男は、当然の様にカティアの隣りの椅子に尻を落とし、その肩を抱き寄せた。*

Katia sounded happy as she was hugged on the shoulder, and Parker laughed sneeringly and welcomed Fluke into his home.

*肩を抱かれたカティアは嬉しげな声を出し、パーカーも卑屈に笑い、フルークを迎え入れた。*

&nbsp;

Fluke was a flamboyantly dressed man, wearing a shirt that was wide open at the chest and many ornaments.

*フルークは胸元を大きく開いたシャツを着て、装飾品も多く身に付けた派手な装いをした男だった。*

Although the attire was far from elegant, the quality of the materials was of high quality, suggesting a good money-making ability.

*上品とは程遠い装いだが、素材の質は上質で、金回りの良さを窺わせた。*

However, in spite of the well-defined sweet mask, her eyes also carry a hint of darkness that is characteristic of people who do not live on the surface.

*だが、整った甘いマスクとは裏腹に、その瞳には、表では生きていない人間特有の仄暗さも纏わせている。*

&nbsp;

What? If it's a good story, let me in on it. Right?

*「なんだぁ？美味い話ならオレにも絡ませろよ。なぁ？！」*

It's petty money that doesn't belong in Fluke! Hey! What's more! Do you have any time after this?

*「フルークには似合わない小っさいお金よ！ねぇ！それより！この後時間あるの？！」*

Time? Well, yeah, at ......? What's the payoff?"

*「時間か？ま、そうだなぁ……で？どんな儲け話だって？」*

I was just asked by a local junior colleague to go and check out the store.

*「なに、ちょいと店を見に行ってくれと、地元の後輩に頼まれただけですよ」*

Heh."

*「へぇ」*

It's a tea house called The Big Vestibule. Do you know it?"

*「『大きな前庭』っていうティーハウスよ。知ってる？」*

"Is that the place near Alfalfa Boulevard? That's another upscale place that doesn't suit you guys! You've got the wrong clientele!

*「そりゃアルファルファ大通り近くの店か？そりゃまたお前らには似合わない高級店だな！客層が違うだろう？！」*

Well, yes. ......

*「ま、そうなんですけどね……」*

&nbsp;

Parker makes a sneer and explains to Fluke that he is going to show his face to the daughter of the lady's maid there.

*パーカーが卑屈な笑いを作り、そこの女給の娘に、顔を見せに行くのだとフルークに説明をする。*

&nbsp;

I'll just go and say hello to them.

*「行くだけ行って、先方に挨拶だけでもして来ますわ」*

&nbsp;

(Did someone ask you to go harass them? Not many idiots would mess with a store like that.

*（どっからか、嫌がらせでもして来いとか頼まれたか？あの辺の店に手を出すバカは、そうそう居ねぇ。*

Well, it's not worth it. There's no good in getting involved in a bad situation. ...... They are free to get hurt on their own. ......)

*ま、割は合わねぇだろうな。下手に関わっても何の旨味もねぇな……。こいつらが、勝手に痛い目に遭うのは自由だがな……）*

&nbsp;

Well, not too much.

*「まあ、程々にな」*

&nbsp;

Having lost interest from both of them, Fluke wiped the story clean from his mind.

*二人から興味を失ったフルークは、この話を頭から綺麗に消し落とした。*

&nbsp;

Well, I don't want to interrupt you two, so I'm going to go now."

*「ンじゃま、二人の邪魔しても悪いんでな、オレはもう行くわ」*

Oh, God! I'm not in your way! If you're going away, I'm going with you!"

*「もう！邪魔じゃないわよ！どっか行くならわたしも行く！」*

Sorry, I have to go to work now."

*「悪りぃな、これから仕事なんだよ」*

Is it you yourself at this hour, brother?"

*「こんな時間から、兄ぃ自らですか？」*

&nbsp;

Fluke, who always leads a large number of prefects, questioned Parker as an exception.

*常に多くの舎弟を率いているフルークに、パーカーが以外だと疑問を零した。*

&nbsp;

I've been shorthanded, so I've been out in the field doing my own thing."

*「人手が減っちまったんでな、オレが直接現場周りだよ」*

That's ......, thanks for your help bro! If you ever need me, I'm always at your service!"

*「そいつは……、ご苦労様です兄ぃ！必要だったら何時でも俺にもお声がけください！」*

Oh! I'll be counting on you. I'll be counting on you."

*「おう！そん時は頼む。期待させてもらうぜ」*

&nbsp;

I'd welcome it if you could use it in moderation," Fluke says to himself, so that they don't hear him.

*カティアの肩から手を離し、立ち上がりながら「ま、適度に使えてくれりゃぁ、歓迎はするぜ」と、フルークは二人に聞こえぬ様、小さく独りごちる。*

But he never even flinches from such a thought.

*だか、そんな考えはおくびにも出す事はない。*

&nbsp;

Fluke turned his back to them, waved his hand affectionately at them, and pulled a note from his pocket. He then glanced down at it curiously and asked, "Rodrigo ......? What's the code for? What's that code?" He mumbled something like that and strode away from the place.

*フルークは二人に背中を向けると、そのままで二人に愛想良さげに手を振りながら、ポケットからメモを取り出した。そして胡乱気にそれこに視線を落とし、「ロドリゴ……？ハッ！何の暗号だよ？」と、そんな事をブツブツと呟き、その場から足早に離れて行った。*
