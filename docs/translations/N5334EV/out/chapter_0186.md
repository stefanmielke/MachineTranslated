Get out!"

*「出ろ！」*

&nbsp;

The rusty iron door opens with a creaking sound like a scream.

*軋む音を悲鳴の様に響かせて、錆びた鉄扉が開いて行く。*

&nbsp;

When we felt the door open, Ralia and Viola were clearly showing signs of fright.

*扉が開く気配がした時、ラリアさんとビオラちゃんは明らかに怯えの色を見せていた。*

I muttered, "It's okay," and stepped in front of the door as if to protect them.

*わたしは「大丈夫」と呟き、2人を庇う様に扉の前へと足を運ぶ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Perhaps surprised that I was standing so close to the door, the man who opened it looked wide-eyed for a moment.

*わたしが扉の近くに立っていた事が意外だったのか、扉を開いた男は一瞬目を見開いていた。*

But he immediately grabs me by the arm and pulls me out the door.

*だが直ぐにわたしの二の腕を掴み、そのまま強引に扉の外へと引っ張る。*

&nbsp;

I gave the mother and daughter a "don't worry" look again and dove through the door as I was pulled in.

*それを見た2人が小さく声を上げるが、わたしは再び母娘に「心配無い」と視線を送り、引かれるままに扉を潜った。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

At any rate, Bibi and Mia should have a good grasp of this location.

*取り敢えず、この場所はビビとミアは把握している筈だ。*

When I was talking to the mother and daughter earlier, I knew that they had already noticed the two of them coming to the front of the building. The small animal that was peeking in at that time was also making many small noises, so the two of them definitely noticed them too.

*さっき母娘と話をしている時、既に2人の気配が建物の前まで来ていたのは分かっていた。その時に覗いていた小動物も、小さく何度も鳴いていたので2人も間違いなく気付いている。*

&nbsp;

And just in case, Viola has been given a marker and buffed in case of any unforeseen circumstances.

*それに一応ビオラちゃんには、不測の事態に備えマーカーも渡してあるし、バフもかけてある。*

These two should not be so treated in any way.

*そうそうこの2人が、どうにかされる事は無い筈だ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When I walked out the door, I found myself in a rather large room.

*扉から出ると、そこはちょっと大き目の部屋になっていた。*

Perhaps it feels even more spacious because the place where I was just now was too small.

*さっきまで居た所が狭すぎたから、余計に広く感じるのかもしれない。*

On either side of the door I came out of, there is a row of similar iron doors. I can tell by the signs that there are other people being held captive in this place.

*わたしが出て来た扉の左右には、同じ様な鉄扉が並んでいる。ココには他にも囚われている人達が居る事が気配で分かる。*

I was tempted to quickly take out the people in front of me and rescue them, but I held my ground.

*今目の前に居る連中を速攻でノして、その人達を助け出したい衝動に駆られるが、ココはグッと我慢する。*

&nbsp;

There are a total of five people in the basement that I can see right now. There was one other person, but I don't think he is here now.

*今、この地下で見える範囲に居る連中は全部で5人。もう1人いた筈だけど、今はココに居ないっぽい。*

&nbsp;

The one who took me out of the room.

*わたしを部屋から連れ出したヤツ。*

The one that closes the door to the room it came out of.

*その出て来た部屋の扉を閉めてるヤツ。*

There is an ascending staircase in front of the building, and in the middle of the staircase there is a guy who stops and looks up as if he is waiting for something.

*正面には昇りの階段があって、その途中では何かを待つ様に立ち止まり、上を向いている奴が居る。*

And the other two sat at a table in the center of the room.

*そして残りの2人は、部屋の中央に置いてあったテーブルに座っていた。*

&nbsp;

They were grinning at me as I was led out of the room with a mug of sake in my hand, and they were smiling at me in a disgusting manner.

*そいつらは、酒が入っているであろうジョッキを手に持ったまま、部屋から連れ出されたわたしを見て、ニヤニヤと嫌らしい笑みを受かべている。*

&nbsp;

You look pretty comfortable, don't you? Huh?

*「随分と余裕のある顔してるじゃねぇか？え？」*

&nbsp;

One of the men sitting at the table called out to me.

*テーブルに座る男の一人が、そう声をかけて来た。*

He poured the contents of the mug he was holding into his mouth and slammed it down on the table.

*ソイツは、手に持っていたジョッキの中身を徐に自分の口に流し込み、そのままそのジョッキをテーブルに上に勢いよく叩き付けた。*

Then he stood up and approached me, swaying his body.

*それからユラリと立ち上がり、身体を揺らしながらわたしに近付いて来る。*

&nbsp;

I recognize this guy.

*コイツには見覚えがある。*

He is a thug who chased us as soon as we entered this town yesterday.

*昨日この街に入って直ぐに、わたし達を追いかけて来た衛士モドキのチンピラだ。*

It seems that this guard modo is no longer willing to hide the fact that he is one of the bandits.

*もうこの衛士モドキは、自分が盗賊達の仲間だと隠す気もないらしい。*

&nbsp;

But this guy must have taken a direct hit from a flowerpot on the head yesterday. ...... is he okay now?

*でもコイツ、昨日は頭に植木鉢が直撃した筈だが、……もう平気なのか？*

Oh, I do have a bandage on my head, in case you're wondering.

*あ、一応頭に包帯は巻いてはいるな。*

&nbsp;

And it's .......

*そして……だ。*

Of course, this guy is also the perverted jerk who fondled my bagged hips!

*あろう事かコイツは、袋詰めにされたわたしのおヒップを撫で回した変態ヤロウでもあるっっ！！*

&nbsp;

They're kidnapping me, so show me some more of that frightened look!"

*「攫われてんだ、もうちっと怯えた顔でもして見せろよ！」*

Oi, don't make a fuss now."

*「オイ、今は騒ぐな」*

Shut up!"

*「うるせぇよ！」*

&nbsp;

What is this guy? Is he in a bad mood?

*何だコイツ？ご機嫌斜めさんか？*

We're the ones in a bad mood.

*ご機嫌斜めなのはこっちだぞ。*

&nbsp;

"How are the mothers and daughters in the middle? "Hee-hee."

*「中の母娘は元気だったかよ？ひひ」*

&nbsp;

The thug grins disgustedly and asks me how the two of us in the room are doing.

*チンピラは嫌らしいニヤけ顔で、わたしに部屋の2人の様子を聞いて来る。*

I replied, "You looked very healthy," and his face instantly contorted.

*わたしはシラっと「とても元気そうでしたよ」と答えると、途端に顔を歪ませた。*

&nbsp;

"You've got to be kidding me! Crunch and his friends are still trying to fuck with me, you fucking pricks!"

*「ふざけやがって！クランチの野郎共々、やっぱ俺をナメてやがんだチキショウめが！！」*

&nbsp;

Apparently, they don't like my nonchalant attitude.

*どうも平然としているわたしが気に入らないらしい。*

He was drinking at Coco's to see more frightened faces and to have a drink with them. ......

*もっと怯えた顔を見て、それを酒のつまみにしたくてココで飲んでいたんだとか……。*

What a lowlife! Well, that was disappointing.

*とんだ下衆野郎だよ！そりゃ期待外れだったね。*

&nbsp;

On top of that, hearing that the mother and daughter inside also seemed to be in good health seems to have ignited something inside this guy.

*その上で、中に居た母娘も元気そうだと聞いて、コイツの中の何かに火が付いてしまったようだ。*

&nbsp;

Hey, shut up.

*「おい、静かにしろ」*

I told you to shut the fuck up! I'll beat you up again today if you don't want to get beat up enough! If you don't want to get hit enough, I'll hit you again today, as you wish!"

*「うるせぇつってんだろが！！クソが！殴られ足りねぇってんなら、お望み通り今日もブン殴ってやる！！」*

&nbsp;

The man holding my arm calls out for me to stop him, but this emotionally unstable-looking guy is not listening to me at all.

*わたしの腕を掴んでいる男が制止しようと呼びかけるが、情緒不安定っぽいコイツは全く聞く耳を持っていない。*

&nbsp;

But this guy is totally out of line.

*でも、コイツは完全にアウトだな。*

The brand new bruises on their faces were apparently made by this guy. Are you saying that he beat them up yesterday?

*2人にあった真新しい顔の痣は、コイツが作った物らしい。昨日、八つ当たり的に2人を殴ったって事か？*

He's not happy to hear that they're doing well. Don't be a fool.

*2人が元気だと聞いて、腹の虫が収まらないとでも言いたげだ。ふざけんじゃ無いぞ。*

Granted, if you hit the two of them now, it will be this guy's fist that gets crushed because it's buffed.

*尤も今の2人を殴っても、バフがかかっているから潰れるのはコイツの拳だろうけどさ。*

&nbsp;

Still, it did not stop the resentment that was welling up inside me.

*それでも、わたしの中で沸々と涌いて来る憤りが収まるワケじゃない。*

I thought I was maintaining my composure, but it seems that anger was leaking from my eyes.

*平静を保っていたつもりが、ついつい目から怒気が漏れていた様だ。*

He noticed my gaze and froze for a moment. He froze for a moment.

*わたしの視線に気が付いて、そいつの動きが一瞬『ビクリ！』と固まった。*

&nbsp;

But he immediately shook his head as if to shake something off and stared back at me.

*だけど直ぐに何かを振り払う様に頭を振り、わたしを睨み返して来た。*

&nbsp;

What's that look in your eye? Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!

*「な、何だコノヤロその眼は？！ナメてんじゃねぇぞゴラァ！！」*

&nbsp;

A thug stepped toward us to grab us.

*チンピラが、掴みかからんとコチラに足を踏み出した。*

Can you be that careless with your feet when you're drunk? It's dangerous, okay?

*酔いが回っているのに、そんな無造作に足を運んで良いのか？危ないぞ？*

&nbsp;

Sure enough, he came crashing down in front of me.

*案の定、わたしの目の前でソイツは、つんのめる様にして勢い良く倒れ込んで来た。*

Well, as a matter of course, this is the result of my shifting my awareness of my actions a bit.

*まあ当然の様に、わたしが行動意識をチョッコっとずらしてやった結果だけどね。*

&nbsp;

I slightly turn my wrist to meet his as he falls down.

*わたしは、倒れ込んで来るソイツに合わせ、僅かばかり手首を返す。*

The shackles on his wrists are raised just a few millimeters. ......

*手首に付けられた手枷が、ほんの数ミリ上がる程度に……。*

&nbsp;

Boguw!!!!"

*「ぼぐゅっ！！」*

&nbsp;

At the perfect moment, the corner of the manacle digs into his nose like a gouge.

*絶妙のタイミングで手枷の角が、抉る様にソイツの鼻面に食い込む。*

The nose blew and popped with great force, and then blew to the other side in a circle.

*そしてそのまま凄い勢いで鼻血を吹き出し弾け、円を描く様に反対側へと吹き飛んだ。*

&nbsp;

Don't tell me you thought it was like a tennis cartoon flying through the air at the force of a nosebleed!

*まるで、鼻血の勢いで空を飛ぶテニスマンガみたいだと思った事は内緒だ！*

&nbsp;

What the hell are you doing? What the fuck are you, a fucking moron?

*「何やってもやがる！マヌケかてめぇはっ？！」*

&nbsp;

A man who had been holding my arm as I was watching him shouted curses at the thug who had rolled over.

*それを見ていたわたしの腕を掴んでいた男が、転がったチンピラに向け罵声を浴びせる。*

At the same time, he looked at me quizzically and muttered, "Don't tell me you're ......?" He muttered, but as he put his hand on my manacle, he mouthed again in a small voice, "Impossible or .......

*同時にわたしを訝しげに見て「まさかお前が……？」と呟くが、わたしの手枷に手を添えると、「無理か……」と再び小さく口にした。*

&nbsp;

Immediately, the man moves away from me and checks the condition of the fallen thug.

*直ぐに男はわたしから離れ、倒れているチンピラの状態を確認しする。*

&nbsp;

You've got a busted nose. ...... Oi! Bring him in! You idiot! You're making me do more work than I have to!

*「鼻が潰れてるじゃねぇか……！オイ！コイツを運べ！バカが！余計な仕事増やしやがって！！」*

&nbsp;

The other person at the table was reprimanded, got out of his seat in a hurry, stuck his hands into the sides of the comatose thug, and tried to pick him up on the spot.

*テーブルにいたもう1人が叱責され慌てて席を立ち、昏倒しているチンピラの両脇に手を突っ込み、その場で抱え上げようとした。*

&nbsp;

You're making a lot of noise.

*「騒がしいなオイ」*

&nbsp;

At about the same time, a man's voice echoes through the basement from the top of the stairs.

*それとほぼ同時に、階段の上から男の声が地下に響く。*

Immediately, the bodies of those in the basement visibly tensed up.

*途端に、地下に居た連中の身体が、目に見えて強張るのが分かる。*

&nbsp;

Down came a lanky, thin, ghastly man with a very pale complexion and terrible dark circles under his eyes.

*降りて来たのは、顔色がとても青白く目の下に酷い隈があって、ひょろりとした薄気味の悪い男だ。*

&nbsp;

What? What the hell is this? What the hell are you doing?"

*「あ？何だこりゃ？なにやってやがる？」*

Yo, this drunken guy just pulled a ......

*「よ、酔っ払ったこいつが引っ繰り返りやがって……」*

"Oh? Leave that thing alone."

*「ああん？そんなモン放っとけ」*

&nbsp;

The man took one boring glance at the man with the smashed nose, and then slowly came down the stairs, shifting his gaze to me.

*男は、つまらなそうに鼻の潰れた男を一瞥すると、そのまま視線をわたしに移しながら、階段をゆっくりと降りて来た。*

When he came up to me, he looked into my face with narrowed eyes, as if he was trying to decide what to buy.

*そしてわたしの目の前まで来ると、まるで品定めでもする様に、薄く細めた眼でわたしの顔を覗き込む。*

&nbsp;

Is this the girl?

*「コレが例の娘か？」*

I even put on the shackles like you said!"

*「言われた通り、枷も着けました！」*

&nbsp;

I can see it in its eyes, which have no heat.

*熱量の無いその眼を見て分かる。*

This guy is the kind of guy who doesn't even think of people as people.

*コイツは人を人とも思っていない類いのヤツだ。*

It's the eye of someone who thinks people are expendable or something.

*人間を、消耗品か何かだと思っているヤツの眼だ。*

It's a really nasty eye.

*実に嫌な眼だ。*

&nbsp;

'You're a pretty ballsy young lady, aren't you? Not bad to look at either. ......"

*「随分と肝の据わったお嬢さんだな？見てくれも悪くない……」*

&nbsp;

As I silently looked back into his reptilian eyes, he sniffed and said something like that.

*爬虫類の様なその眼を無言で見返していると、そいつは鼻を鳴らしながらそんな風に言って来た。*

He even put his finger on my chin and did a "chin squeeze" on my chin!

*その上にあろう事か、わたしの顎に指をかけて『顎クイ』までして来やがった！*

&nbsp;

By the way, his fingers are cold. It's as if they don't feel body heat.

*それにしてもコイツの指冷たいな。まるで体温を感じない。*

It was depressing enough, so I shook my chin and paid him off with my finger.

*いい加減鬱陶しいので、顎を振って指を払ってやった。*

&nbsp;

"......, you're a strong man, aren't you? That's nice, I like that."

*「……ふん、気も強いってか？良いね、俺好みだ」*

&nbsp;

I don't like it!

*わたしは好みぢゃねぇよ！*

&nbsp;

The cold-eyed man, who was not concerned about my frustration, gave instructions to the men in the basement. He is going to put me on a carriage.

*わたしの苛つきを他所に、冷たい目の男が地下室の男達に指示を出す。わたしをこれから馬車に乗せるらしい。*

Before that, he tells me to blindfold myself with Coco.

*その前にココで目隠しをしろと言う。*

&nbsp;

Is this some kind of bandit hideout?

*「ココって、盗賊のアジトなので、しょう？」*

"............"

*「…………」*

&nbsp;

While a cloth was being put over my face to blindfold me, I asked the man for a moment.

*わたしの顔に目隠し用の布がかけられる中、ちょっと男に声をかけてみた。*

His eyes meet with a man who puts his finger on his chin and opens his eyes slightly.

*頤に指を当て、目を僅かに開いた男と目線が交わり合う。*

&nbsp;

Where the hell are you taking me from here?

*「ココから更に、一体どこへ連れて行くおつもりです、か？」*

You mean you're aware of all the ...... stuff? Well, that's okay. I don't want to damage the top of the ball. I don't want to damage the top of the ball."

*「……色々承知の上って事か？まあ良いさ。くれぐれも無駄な事は止めてくれよ？折角の上玉を傷物にはしたくないんだ」*

&nbsp;

With my vision closed by the cloth, I could read the sound of amusement in the man's voice, along with an unpleasant sensation.

*視界が布で閉じられる中、男の声に愉悦の響きが含まれるのが、不快な感覚と共に読み取れた。*

&nbsp;

'But, well, if you run away, you have to deal with it in a certain way. ......Well, I'm not going to give up that kind of pleasure to anyone."

*「だが、まあ逃げたとなりゃ、それなりに処理をしなきゃならん。……まあ、そんな愉しみを人に譲る気は無いけどな」*

&nbsp;

The impersonal laughter, squeezed from the back of his throat, echoes off the cold walls of the basement.

*喉の奥から絞り出すような人間味の無い笑いが、地下の冷たい壁に響き渡る。*

&nbsp;

They are now going to invite us to their home base.

*いよいよこれから、連中の本拠地へとご招待をしてくれるらしい。*

&nbsp;

Yes, I know.

*ええ、分かっていますよ。*

I will be properly quiet until I arrive at the place where you have invited me.

*お招きされた先に到着するまでは、ちゃんと大人しくしておりますよ。*

Yes, yes! That's what a lady is supposed to do! Of course I understand!

*ええ、ええ！それが淑女の嗜みですからね！勿論、分かっておりますとも！！*
