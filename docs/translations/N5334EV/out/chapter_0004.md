## 04話　スージィ今後の方針を考える

“So, you see, modern people are all stiff, but seniors are even more so.”

*「ですからね、現代人は皆ガチガチに身体固まってるんですけど、先輩はより一層固まってますから」*

"Is that so?”

*「むぅ、そうなのか？」*

“Look at my feet! Even though I'm shaking them like this, my ankles don't move at all, do they? They're still stiff.“

*「見てくださいよ、この足！　こんな揺すってるのに足首全く揺れないでしょ？　固まったままです」*

”Isn't everyone like this?“

*「皆、こんなもんじゃないの？」*

”Normally, they move to some extent.“

*「普通は多少なりとも動きますから」*

”Hmm...”

*「むむぅ」*

“The fact that you're stiff means you're unconsciously continuing to put in effort. You need to start by becoming aware of how much energy you're wasting on a daily basis.“

*「凝り固まってるって言うのは無意識に力を入れ続けてるって事ですから。どれだけ普段から無駄にエネルギーを消費しているか自覚するところから始めて下さい」*

”I'm not aware of that at all!“

*「そんな自覚は全く無い！」*

”Well, it's the result of continuing to make unnatural movements in an unnatural posture. If you're not aware of your bad habits, there's no way you can fix them.”

*「まあ不自然な姿勢で無理な動きを続けて来た結果ですから。悪い癖は自覚しないと直しようがありませんからね」*

“I wonder if I've been doing things like that with an unnatural posture? I thought I'd been living normally...“

*「不自然な姿勢とかそんなにしてたかなぁ？　普通に暮らしてきたつもりだけど…」*

”That's it, modern people start to stiffen up when they're still children. The 'attention' and 'front, please' they do when they start elementary school are the worst. That's when they get into the habit of standing with their backs stiff.“

*「あれです、現代人はもう子供の頃に固まり始めてますから。小学校に入るとやる『気を付け』『前へならえ』あれ最悪ですね。あれで力入れて立つ癖が付いてしまう」*

”Eeek, is that so? Everyone did that!”

*「うえ！　そうなの？　誰でもやってたじゃん！」*

“That's why everyone today is so stiff. My master said, 'There are hardly any modern people who can stand properly or walk properly'.“

*「だから現代人皆ガチガチなんですよ。師匠も言ってました。『現代人でロクに立ってるヤツ、歩けてるヤツは殆ど居ない』って」*

”Wow... how does the world look from the perspective of a master?“

*「うはぁ・・・達人目線で世間ってどう見えてんだよ？」*

”So let's start with loosening up these legs.“

*「だから先輩もまずはこの足ほぐすトコから始めましょう」*

”Ugh... it looks like it's going to take a while...”

*「くうぅ…先が長そうだぁ……」*

&nbsp;

－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

...I had a dream that felt familiar...

*…何だか懐かしい夢を…見たな…。*

&nbsp;

A year junior to me, we were in the same team at work about seven years ago.

*7年ほど前、職場で同じチームで一緒になった1年後輩。*

We got along well and hung out a lot even after the project was over.

*何かと馬が合ってプロジェクトが終わった後もよくつるんでいた。*

&nbsp;

It seems that he was a disciple of a great master of ancient martial arts, and I often learned about martial arts from him.

*何でも古武術の凄い先生の弟子をしているらしく、よく武術関連の話を教えて貰っていた。*

I was often taken to see performances by various martial arts masters, and we spent a lot of time together outside of work.

*色んな武術の先生の公演とかも連れられたりして、仕事以外の時間も一緒に過ごす事が多かった。*

&nbsp;

I was remembering these things as I dozed off in the early morning...

*明け方のまどろみの中、そんな事を思い出していた………。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In the end, I spent the night on the riverbed by the waterfall.

*結局その日はその滝壺の河原で一晩過ごした。*

&nbsp;

What did I do with the time after midday? It goes without saying.

*昼過ぎからの時間は一体何に使っていたのか？は言わずもがな。*

&nbsp;

Perhaps my strength and resilience, which exceeded human understanding, were the key to opening a new door.

*人知を超えた体力と回復力は、新たなる扉を開く鍵となったのかもしれない。*

&nbsp;

Even so, spending the first night of camping in a strange place without any clothes on is not an advisable thing to do.

*それでも見知らぬ場所で、初めての野宿を服も着ないで過すなど勧められる行為ではない。*

He woke up at dawn, as if ashamed of himself, and took a bath, but when he returned to the tent, he fidgeted around and took another bath, so he probably didn't feel too bad about it.

*明け方に恥じ入ったように起きだしては水浴びをしていたが、テントに戻るとモゾモゾと蠢き、何度も水浴びをし直しているのだから、余り反省は無いのだろう。*

&nbsp;

The items I had with me for camping came in handy.

*野営には持って居たアイテムが役に立った。*

They were quest items in my inventory.

*インベントリ内のクエストアイテムだ。*

I wasn't able to take them out during the game, but now I can take them out and use them.

*ゲーム時には取り出すことが出来なかった物だが、今は取り出して使う事も出来る様だ。*

&nbsp;

Last night, I took out the 'one-person tent' and 'villager's blanket' that were in my inventory, as well as some animal fur, and used them.

*昨晩はそのクエアイテムにあった『一人用簡易テント』と『村人の毛布』、それに動物の毛皮を取出して利用した。*

For dinner, I tried eating the 'Mum's Salmon Stew' that I had with me, which is a recovery item (that restores a small amount of HP, etc.)... but.

*食事は持っていた回復アイテム（少量のHPを回復するなど）の『マムのサーモンシチュー』があったのでそれを食べてみた……が。*

&nbsp;

'It's really bad tasting', it seems.

*『とても不味い』らしい。*

Anyway, it's so bland that there's hardly any taste at all.

*とにかく味が薄くて殆ど無いのだ。*

&nbsp;

There are other recovery items that look like they could be eaten, but they all have almost no taste.

*他にも色々と食糧になりそうな回復アイテムはあるのだが、どれもこれも味がほとんど無い。*

&nbsp;

It's not that they're inedible, but they're not something you'd want to reach out and eat.

*食べられない訳ではないのだが、自分から手を伸ばして食べたいと思うものではない。*

&nbsp;

Suzy thought she'd hold off on eating until she felt really hungry.

*食事は空腹感が限界になるまで我慢しよう……と思うスージィだった。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She also took some low-level equipment out of the guild warehouse.

*装備品も、ギルド倉庫から低いレベルの物を取り出した。*

&nbsp;

In the game, equipment was divided into 11 basic ranks.

*ゲームに於いて、装備品は基本11段階のランク分けがされていた。*

&nbsp;

'Zero Rank' for beginners who have just started the game and have not yet chosen a job

*ゲームを始めたばかりで、職に就く前の初心者レベルが使う『ゼロランク』*

'D/C Rank' which can be used after choosing your first job

*最初の職に就く事で使えるようになる『D・Cランク』*

'B/A Rank' which can be used after advancing to a specialized job

*その後、専門職へと進んでから装備できる『B・Aランク』*

'S/SS Rank' which can be used after further advancing to a specialized type

*更にその先、専門特化型へと進化後に使える『S・SSランク』*

And then there are the 'G Zero, G1, G2, G3 Ranks', which can be used by those who have transcended humanity and become divine.

*そして、人を越え神域へと神化した者が使える『Gゼロ・G1・G2・G3ランク』*

&nbsp;

Suzie was equipped with the Nemesis Dual Sword and Oracle Heavy Armor, which are both higher-level G Zero equipment.

*スージィが装備していたのはGゼロの上位、ネメシスデュアルソードとオラクル重鎧だ。*

&nbsp;

But even that is, to be frank, low-level equipment in the game.

*だがそれも、ゲーム内ではハッキリ言って雑魚装備である。*

&nbsp;

Even so, it seems to be quite over-specced for this area.

*それでもこの地では、かなりのオーバースペックの様だ。*

&nbsp;

Suzie was now wearing A-rank equipment.

*今スージィはAランクの装備を身に着けていた。*

She was wearing jet-black plate armor, two swords that shone with silver, and no cape.

*漆黒のプレートアーマーに白銀に輝く2刀、マントは無い。*

The swords were wide, and although they had fine decorations on the blade's belly, they were rather plain.

*剣は幅広で、刃の腹に細かい装飾がされているが武骨な物だ。*

&nbsp;

“Let's see how it goes with this. Let's try it without enchantments. If it looks dangerous, we can always put the equipment back!"

*「これで取敢えず様子見かな？　エンチャは無しでいってみよ。危なそうだったら装備戻せば良いしね！」*

&nbsp;

Originally, the guild warehouse stored equipment for each rank and job, in sets for use in raising sub-characters.

*元々ギルド倉庫には各ランク、各職用の装備を、サブキャラ育成用にとセットごとに保管していた。*

This time, we picked out equipment that wasn't too expensive or too cheap.

*今回は、高すぎず低すぎずの装備を見繕い、取り出したのだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“The mobs that were scattered around yesterday have come back in droves today."

*「昨日散らばってたMobも、今日になって随分戻って来たな」*

&nbsp;

I used search to check the current situation around me.

*探索を使い、今の周りの状況を確認してみる。*

I immediately looked up to the right.

*すると、直ぐにスッと右上方に向け顔を上げた。*

I could see a flying mob moving from the right to the left.

*飛行しているMobが、右方向から左方向へ移動しているのが視認出来た。*

&nbsp;

“A flying mob I didn't see yesterday... a 'Gray Wyvern'. I'd estimate the distance to be about 90 meters."

*「昨日は見なかった飛行型のMobか……『グレイ・ワイバーン』ね。距離、推定90メートルってとこかな？」*

&nbsp;

With a whoosh of spirit, he channels his ‘ki’ into his weapon.

*ハァァァァッッ！！と気合と共に『気』を武器に籠める。*

&nbsp;

“This is the first shot for long-range, right? In the game, the maximum range was about 15 meters, but here I feel like I can reach it!“

*「やっぱり遠距離への初撃はコレだよね！　ゲームでは射程は精々15メートルってとこだったけど、ココでは何か届きそうな気がすんだよな！」*

&nbsp;

With that, he thrust out his left arm, lowered his right hand to face level, and crouched down.

*そう言うと左腕を突出し、右手を顔の高さに合わせ腰を落とした。*

He pointed the tips of his two swords at the target and shouted.

*二刀の剣先を標的に向け叫ぶ。*

&nbsp;

”I'm going to take a shot at it!”

*「狙い撃つぜっっ！！！」*

&nbsp;

Impact Blaster

*≪インパクト・ブラスター≫*

The swordsman releases his accumulated ki and attacks a distant enemy.

*溜めた剣気を飛ばし、遠距離の敵を攻撃する。*

This is a skill of the close-range attacker 'Duel Barbarian'.

*近接アタッカー『デュエルバーバリアン』のスキルだ。*

&nbsp;

The shock released from the tip of the sword becomes visible, and it heads towards the target at a speed faster than sound, emitting a white light.

*剣先から放たれ可視となった衝撃が、音速を超え白い光を放ちながら標的に向かう。*

&nbsp;

The target and the white light intersect.

*標的と白い光が交差する。*

A moment later, it explodes and scatters.

*一瞬後、それは爆ぜて散った。*

&nbsp;

A dull explosion sound like something heavy bursting echoes a beat later.

*一拍遅れて何か重い物が弾ける様な鈍い破裂音が響いて来る。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“……………Dirty fireworks.”

*「……………汚ねぇ花火だ」*

&nbsp;

I said it.

*言っちゃったよ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“Conclusion! The mobs around here are weak!”

*「結論！　この辺のMobは雑魚い！！」*

&nbsp;

I came to this conclusion.

*結論づけた。*

&nbsp;

With a few beads of sweat trickling down my cheeks.

*一筋二筋、頬に汗を垂らせながら。*

&nbsp;

“I guess I'll have to find a stronger opponent!“

*「やはり、もうちょい強い相手探さないとダメだよなっ！」*

&nbsp;

He put his hand over his eyes and looked around, as if searching for something in the distance.

*と目の上に手を置いて、キョロキョロと遠方を見る様なポーズを取って見た。*

&nbsp;

”All I can see is trees... Is there any higher ground around here? If I go up there, I'm sure I'll find something stronger than this...”

*「こんなん見ても樹木しか見えないしなぁ……。どっかにもっと高台でもなかろかね？　いっそあそこまで行けば、ココよりずっと強いのは居そうなんだけどねー」*

&nbsp;

He looked at the snowy mountain range that rose up to the north like a white wall and muttered to himself.

*北側に聳える、白い壁の様な雪の山脈を眺めて独りごちた。*

&nbsp;

"I wonder how high it is? Is it as high as Everest? I've never been there, so I don't know! Is it 8000 meters high? It would be nice to look down on the world from up there.”

*「標高どんくらいあんだろ？　エベレストぐらいあんのかな？　行った事無いからワカンナイけどね！　8000メートルとかだっけ？　あの上から世界を見下ろすってのもいいかもねー」*

&nbsp;

He put his left hand on his hip and scratched his temple with his right hand.

*左手を腰に当て、右手でポリポリとこめかみを掻きながら……。*

&nbsp;

“……Why don't I just jump?”

*「……いっそ跳んでみるか？」*

&nbsp;

He muttered to himself as if he had just thought of something.

*と、何か思いついた様に呟いた。*

&nbsp;

“There's no jump point, but I think I can jump up normally.”

*「ジャンプポイントは無いけど、普通に跳び上がるくらいは出来ちゃう気がすんだよなー」*

&nbsp;

In the game, characters who have been 'divine' have a way of moving that allows them to fly to any location by jumping from a predetermined jump point... but there are no jump points here.

*ゲーム内に於いて『神化』が済んだキャラクターは、決められたジャンプポイントから跳び上がれば、任意の場所へ飛んで渡れると云う移動手段を持っていた……のだが、ここにはジャンプポイントは無い。*

&nbsp;

“But you can jump, right? I haven't tried jumping with all my might yet...! The trick to enjoying games is to try things that look like they might work!“

*「でも跳び上がるだけならできるよね？　全力で跳ぶ、とかまだやってないし……。やれそうな事は取敢えず試してみる！　ってのがゲームを楽しむコツだもんなっ！」*

&nbsp;

He bent down as if to gather strength.

*そう言うとグッと力を貯める様に屈み込んだ。*

&nbsp;

“Dooooo-seeeeee!”

*「どぉっっっせぃっっっっ！！！」*

&nbsp;

At the moment he kicked the ground, the ground caved in.

*大地を蹴ったその瞬間、その地が大きく陥没した。*

&nbsp;

The roots of the trees around him were pulled out of the ground, and the trees tried to fall over, but the next shock wave spread out and knocked them over forcefully.

*抉れる地面に根を引かれ、周りの樹木が倒れ込もうとするが、次に起きた衝撃波の広がりにより、勢いよく外側へ薙ぎ倒されて行った。*

The person who kicked up the earth with a roar was already far up in the sky.

*轟音を辺りへ響かせ大地を蹴ったその者は、既に遥か上空に居た。*

&nbsp;

“Whoa, this is high, isn't it? I think I've gone up 40 or 50 meters, right?”

*「うおほっとっと……コレ、た高くね？4～50メートルは昇ってるよね？」*

&nbsp;

In the sky, where the wind was blowing and the clouds were drifting, he looked around and was surprised at his own jumping ability.

*風が吹き結ぶ空の中、周りを見渡し自らの跳躍力に驚いている。*

&nbsp;

“I thought I'd be able to jump a couple of meters, but... what is this? Have I gone 60 meters up? This is the view from a high-rise apartment building, right? I've never climbed one before!

*「2～3メートルも飛べればと思ってたけど……これは？！　60位行ったか？！　タワーマンションとかからの眺めだよなコレ！　登った事無いけどさっ！！！」*

&nbsp;

Eventually, he reached the highest point of his jump and was able to see the horizon with his own eyes.

*やがて跳躍の到達点に達し、地平の彼方をその目で確認出来た。*

&nbsp;

“Wow, there's a forest all the way to the horizon except for the northern mountain range! This forest is as big as the Kanto Plain, isn't it? It's not a sea of trees, it's a sea of trees and forests! And the forest is a little thin in the south... I think?

*「うあああ！　北の山脈以外地平線まで森が続いてるじゃん！　この森、関東平野くらいあんじゃね？　樹海っちうか、もうコレ樹深海だろ！！　で、でも南はちょっとだけ森が薄い……のかな？」*

&nbsp;

Eventually, his body began to descend slowly.

*やがてその身がユックリと下降をし始めた。*

&nbsp;

“Oh? Oh? I'm falling! But! But! I'm fine, right? It's a dream, so it's fine, right? Whoa!

*「お？　をお？　お！　お落ちる！　けど！　けど！　平気……だよね！？　ゆ夢だもんダイジブだよねっ！　うおっほぉぉぉぉぉ！！！」*

&nbsp;

She landed with a heavy thud, sending up a cloud of dust.

*そのままズシリと大地に重い振動を響かせて、土煙を上げながら着地した。*

&nbsp;

“I was so surprised! I'm fine! As I thought, it was a dream! I was so scared! I'm so glad it was a dream!"

*「ビ、ビックリしたぁぁ！　へ平気だったぁぁ！　さすが夢！　あぁぁビビッたぁぁ！　夢でよかったぁぁぁぁ！！」*

&nbsp;

He landed on his feet, creating a crater in the process.

*クレーターを作りながらも綺麗に両脚で着地した。*

After that, he got down on all fours and put his hands on the ground, and let out a heart-wrenching cry.

*その後ペタリと両手を突いて四つん這いになり、悲痛な叫びを上げた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“Well, I've got a better idea of the situation around me than I thought, but what should I do now?”

*「さて、思った以上に周りの状況が把握出来た訳だが……どしましょうかね？」*

&nbsp;

But he quickly got himself together and stood up, looking around while putting his hands on his hips.

*だが直ぐにスクッと気を取り直した様に立ち上がり、腰に手を当てながら周りを見渡してみた。*

&nbsp;

“I had a feeling that there were people living in the south. The theory is that if you want to progress in the game, you have to go down to the village and gather information, but there's no one stronger than me in the south. But I have a feeling that there's something in that mountain... I don't know why, but I have a feeling. Anyway, it's essential that I make the village my base, so I need to think about how I'm going to get there..."

*「南の先に人が居そうなのは、何となく感じた……。ゲームを進めるなら人里に降りて、情報収集ってのがセオリーだけど、でも南には明らかにココより強いのは居ないんだよなぁ……。だけどあの山の方には、何となく何か居る気がすんだよねぇ……、何となくだけど。いずれ人里を拠点にするのは必須として、どうルート取りをするか……だね」*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I tried to think about it while folding my fingers.

*指を折りながら考えてみた。*

&nbsp;

“Once we get down to the village, we'll get ready and then head for the mountains, and after exploring, we'll head back to the village.”

*「一旦人里に降り準備を整えてから山に向かい、探索の後人里へ戻る」*

&nbsp;

“We'll head for the mountains as they are, and after exploring, we'll head for the village.”

*「このまま山へ向かい探索の後、人里を目指す」*

&nbsp;

"Clearing the forest to create a place to live... there isn't any.”

*「森を切り開きここに生活の場を作る……無いワぁ」*

&nbsp;

He crosses his arms and thinks while looking at the mountains.

*腕を組んで山を見ながら思考する。*

&nbsp;

"If I'm going to the mountains, what do I need to prepare? Equipment and food to get through the forest and into the mountains? I think I can manage with the equipment I already have. As for food... if I don't go overboard... I think it would be pretty tiring to leave the forest, then go back and forth through this Juken Sea... wouldn't it?”

*「山へ行くとして準備ってなんだ？　森を抜け山に入る為の装備品や食料か？　装備は持ち前の物で何とかなりそうだよな。食料も……贅沢さえ言わなければ……ね。一旦森を出て、それから改めてこの樹深海を往復ってのも、考えると結構ウンザリかなぁ……？」*

&nbsp;

He looked up towards the mountains.

*山脈に向けて顔を上げた。*

&nbsp;

“All right, I've decided!”

*「よし！　決めた！」*

&nbsp;

He started to move towards the north.

*北方向へその身を進める。*

&nbsp;

“First I'll explore the mountains, then head south.”

*「まずは山を探索！　それから南へ向かう」*

&nbsp;

He put his index finger to his mouth and seemed to be thinking about something.

*人差し指を立て口元に当て、なにやら考えているようだ。*

&nbsp;

“I guess I should take some water with me. I'll go to the water source and get some water... and get ready... and do a lot of things... and then... right?

*「取敢えず水くらいは持って行かないとな。水場に行って水汲んで……準備して。……色々……して、……それから……かな？　……ねぇ？」*

&nbsp;

For some reason, he was slightly flushed in the cheeks as he ran off to the water source.

*トトトっと、何故だか薄らと頬に赤味を帯びながら、小走りに水場へ向かって行った。*

&nbsp;

"Yeah, I guess I should do that first...”

*「ウン、まずはして……から……だね」*

&nbsp;

It seems like they're going to do something first before setting off.

*ナニかしてから出発するらしい。*
