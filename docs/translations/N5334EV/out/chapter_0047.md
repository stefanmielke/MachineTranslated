# 42 - Spring in Amkam

## 42話　アムカムの春

Thank you for your patience, and here we are at the start of chapter 2.

*お待たせしております。2章スタートです。*

In the meantime, we will continue to bring up what we are currently writing on a daily basis.

*とりあえず、今書き上がっている分を連日で上げてまいります。*

Please come back and visit us if you like.

*宜しければ、またお付き合い下さいませ。*


----------------

&nbsp;

Mild sunshine with the feeling of spring.

*春の訪れを感じる穏やかな日差し。*

Fresh greenery peeked out as the snow melted, and the chirping of birds also signaled the end of winter.

*雪解けと共に顔を覗かせる新緑と、鳥のさえずりも冬の終わりを告げていた。*

&nbsp;

Now it's 2 Souzuki.

*今は2の蒼月。*

After the coldest month of the year, the red month, the wind begins to bring a gentle breeze.

*一年の内、尤も寒さの厳しい1の紅月を過ぎ、風も穏やかな気配を運び始める時期だ。*

&nbsp;

The winters in Amkam are surprisingly harsh.

*アムカムの冬は存外に厳しい。*

Usually we have to wait for two red moons for the snow to melt, but this year most of the snow has already transformed itself into a river flow.

*例年であれば雪解けは2の紅月を待たねばならないが、今年は既に大方の雪は川の流れへとその姿を変えていた。*

&nbsp;

Even here in Copetown, the gateway to Amcom County, you will not see the whiteness of winter snow on the cobblestones except in the shade where the sun does not shine all day long.

*アムカム郡の玄関口である此処コープタウンにも、その石畳の上には一日中陽の当たらぬ物陰以外、冬を示す雪の白さを見る事は無い。*

&nbsp;

Copetown is the gateway and terminal town for Amcom County.

*コープタウンはアムカム郡の玄関口でありターミナルタウンだ。*

Those who have business in the villages of Amkham County must first stop in this town.

*アムカム郡の村々へ用向きのある者は、まずこの町へ立ち寄らなくてはならない。*

Those from the villages who wish to reach the center must first take a stagecoach to De Kembel.

*また村々から中央を目指す者は、此処からまず駅馬車でデケンベルへと向かう事になる。*

&nbsp;

This Copetown is a small town with a total population of about 3,000.

*此処コープタウンは総人口3千人程の小さな町だ。*

The townscape, built around a stagecoach stop, is beautifully laid out with neatly arranged cobblestones, and spreads out in a grid pattern around the main street that runs from the stop to the south.

*駅馬車の停車場を中心に作られた町並みは、端正に並べられた石畳が美しく、その停車場から南へ抜ける大通りを中心に碁盤状に広がっている。*

Most of the buildings were made of half-timber frame construction, with white plaster walls creating a beautiful cityscape.

*建物の殆どは半木骨造で作られ、白い漆喰の壁が美しい街並みを作っていた。*

&nbsp;

Most of the buildings facing the main street are stores and wholesalers of Amkam products.

*大通りに面した建物は、殆どがアムカム産の商品を扱う商店で卸業者だ。*

The boulevard is not only used by stagecoaches, but also by the many horse-drawn carriages used by stores like this one for transportation.

*大通りは駅馬車だけではなく、この様な商店が輸送に使う馬車の行き来も多い。*

One turn off the main street and the street width is impassable for horse-drawn carriages.

*その大通りから一本入れば馬車は通れぬ道巾だ。*

The market was bustling with people and countless retail stalls.

*人の往来も多く小売の露店が無数に並び、所狭しとマーケットが広がり賑わいを見せていた。*

&nbsp;

Copetown is also a commercial area with more people coming and going than its population numbers.

*コープタウンは、その人口数以上に多くの人が行き交う商業地でもあるのだ。*

&nbsp;

If there are many people, there will inevitably be trouble, and there will inevitably be bad people.

*人が多ければ必然的にトラブルも発生するし、良からぬ輩も順当に湧いてくる。*

In this country, the security is maintained by the Order of the Knights.

*この国では治安維持は騎士団が執り行っている。*

However, there are no regular knights residing in small provincial cities like Copetown.

*しかしコープタウンの様な地方の小都市に正騎士は在留していない。*

Instead, guards were stationed to deal with people's problems and maintain order.

*その代り兵卒である衛士達が駐在し、人々のトラブル対処に当り秩序を保っていた。*

&nbsp;

The crime rate in Copetown is extremely low, due in part to the service of the guards.

*衛士達の務めもあり、コープタウンの犯罪率は極めて低い。*

This is because, along with the presence of the guards, everyone in the region is fully aware of the power of the inhabitants of Amkam.

*それは衛士達の存在と共に、この地方の者達が皆、アムカムの住人の力を十分に理解しているからだ。*

There is no one here who would do anything foolish on the surface.

*表だって愚かな真似をする者など、まず此処には居ない。*

However, this is not to say that there are no lawless people.

*しかし無法な者が皆無と云う訳でもない。*

However, most of those who cause a commotion are strangers who do not understand Amcam.

*ただ、騒ぎを起こす者の殆どは、アムカムを理解していない余所者達なのだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Here, too, were those who had drifted in from other places where they had never heard of Amkam.

*此処にもまた、アムカムを知らぬ余所から流れて来た者達が居た。*

&nbsp;

They are former illegals. They do not choose serious jobs and do not hesitate to rob others for food.

*彼らは元は不法入国者だ。真面な職を選ばず、食い扶持の為に他者から奪う事を躊躇わない。*

It was a cesspool of such people.

*ソレはそんな達が寄り集まった掃き溜めだった。*

They had at some point become bandits and collectively threatened the people.

*彼らは何時しか賊徒となり、集団で民を脅かす存在になっていた。*

&nbsp;

They had drifted in from the eastern cities and at first thought they could easily exploit the northern countryside with a little violence, as they had always done.

*東の都市から流れて来た彼らは最初、北の田舎者など僅かな暴力で何時もの様に簡単に搾取できると考えていた。*

But they did not understand the power of the people of the North.

*だが、彼らは北方の民の力を理解していなかったのだ。*

&nbsp;

The sun is still high in the afternoon.

*まだ陽も高い昼下がり。*

When they entered the town, the first thing they noticed was a western clothing store.

*町に入り、彼らが最初に目を付けたのは一軒の洋品店だった。*

In the storefronts, high quality goods, rarely seen in the cities they were in, were randomly lined up.

*店先には、自分達が居た都市では滅多にお目に掛れない、質の高い品物が無造作に並んでいる。*

The only two people in the restaurant are two young girls who are not yet twenty years old.

*店内に居るのは、まだ二十歳になるかならないかの年若い娘が二人だけだ。*

&nbsp;

In their eyes, it was the perfect prey.

*彼らの眼に、それは絶好の獲物に映った。*

&nbsp;

This is a back street with few people.

*此処は人目の少ない裏通りだ。*

If this many people break in, we can overrun them without making them resist.

*この人数で押し入れば抵抗させることなく蹂躙出来る。*

With such an array of luxury goods, there should be enough cash in the store's vault to satisfy themselves.

*これだけの高級品が並んでいるのだ、店の金庫には自分達を満足させられるだけの現金が有って良いはずだ。*

If time permits, there may be room to have fun with these girls.

*時間が許すなら、この娘たちで楽しむ余裕もあるかもしれない。*

No, just take them away and enjoy them to the fullest and then sell them.

*いや、そのまま連れ去って愉しみ尽くしてから売れば良い。*

&nbsp;

They walked into the store with such a convenient imagination and a churlish smile on their faces.

*彼らはそんな都合の良い想像を膨らませ、野卑な笑いを浮かべながら店内へと入って行った。*

&nbsp;

The anomaly was abrupt.

*異変は唐突だった。*

The moment one of the men pointed a knife in his hand at the quiet-looking girl who approached him to serve him and made a crude threat.

*接客の為に近寄って来た大人しそうな娘に、男たちの一人が手に持ったナイフを向け、粗野な脅しをかけた瞬間。*

The man collapsed on the spot.

*その男がその場に崩れ落ちた。*

&nbsp;

I didn't know what happened; before I could see, half of my eight companions had been seized.

*何が起きたか分らなかった、見る間に8人いた仲間の半数が取り押さえられたのだ。*

Those who were hunted into consciousness in an instant were lucky.

*一瞬で意識を狩られた者は幸運だった。*

Some were rendered unable to chew for the rest of their lives, some had their arms bent crookedly, and some would never be able to step on the earth again.

*ある者は一生モノを咀嚼する事を出来なくされ、ある者は腕を歪に折り曲げられ、ある者は二度と大地を踏む事が叶わなくなった。*

The tyranny was perpetrated by only two young, elderly female clerks.

*その暴虐を、たった二人の年若い女性店員が行ったのだ。*

Those who failed to understand the situation were reaped by them one after another.

*その状況を理解出来なかった者は、次々と彼女達に薙ぎ倒された。*

Only those who were able to perceive the danger very quickly were able to escape from the situation.

*逸速く危機察知能力が働いた者のみ、その場から逃げ去る事が出来たのだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I don't know where he escaped from.

*何処をどう逃げたのかは分らない。*

They found themselves alone together.

*気が付けば彼らは二人だけになっていた。*

They struggled to control their ragged breathing and hid in an alleyway.

*彼らは荒れる呼吸を必死に抑え、路地裏に身を潜めていた。*

&nbsp;

What? What the hell is this?

*「何だよ？！どういう事だよコレはよ？！」*

I don't know! What the hell was that? Did you see that?

*「知らねェよっ！何なんだよアレ？！お前見えてたか？！」*

I don't know... did he have a weird shape from the knees down?

*「分らねェ…アイツ、膝から下が変な形になってなかったか？！」*

That arm... how many places was it bent?"

*「あの腕…一体何か所で曲がってた？」*

&nbsp;

They both remembered the scene, their faces blue with stubble that had not been groomed for days, and felt a chill shiver run up their spines.

*二人は現場を思い出し、幾日も手入れをしていない無精髭に塗れた顔を青くして、薄ら寒い震えが背筋を上がって来るのを感じていた。*

&nbsp;

This is impossible! Are the people up north crazy, even the clerks?

*「あり得無ェだろコレ！北の住人は店員までどうかしてんのか？！」*

Tic'sho! It's because the Knights of Dekenberger were there! That's where it started! That's where things started to go wrong! That's where they got the head, that's where we all got split up! How the hell did we end up running away to the countryside? Shit!

*「チックショウ！デケンベルに騎士団なんかが居やがったからだ！あそこからだ！あそこからおかしく成りやがった！あそこでお頭が捕まって、皆バラバラになっちまったからだ！何でこんな田舎に逃げようなんて事になったんだ？！クソッ！」*

Who the hell is that? Who was that guy who suggested breaking into that store? What are we going to do? This place is in trouble too! We gotta get Toto and get out of here!

*「誰だよ！あんな店に押し入ろうとか言い出したヤツは？！どうすんだよ！ココもヤベェぞ！トットとずらから無ェと！！」*

I said, "So where do you want me to run to? Damn it! That idiot pulled a knife on me without thinking!

*「だからドコに逃げろってんだよ？！クソッ！あの馬鹿が何も考えずナイフなんか突き付けやがったからだ！」*

&nbsp;

They continued to have such meaningless arguments.

*二人はそんな意味の無い言い争いを続けていた。*

They go on and on about how it's that thing's fault, whose fault it is, and how they have nothing to blame themselves for.

*アレのせいだ誰のせいだと、自分達には何の非も無いと、自分本位な言い草を延々と繰り返していく。*

&nbsp;

Suddenly they stopped moving.

*そんな二人が突然ピタリと動きを止めた。*

They noticed a figure approaching the small street bordering the alleyway where they now lurk.

*今、彼らが潜む路地裏に接する小さな通りに、人影が近付く事に気が付いたのだ。*

It could be the guards following the two .......

*それは二人を追う衛士達かもしれない……。*

The two held their fears and peeked down the street under their breath.

*2人は恐れを抱き、息を潜めて通りを覗った。*

But it was not the guards they feared who appeared there.

*しかしそこに現れたのは、彼らが恐れる衛士達では無かった。*

&nbsp;

It was a girl holding a large basket with both hands.

*それは、両手で大きな籠を抱えた少女だった。*

A petite girl, probably 12 or 3 years old, is walking around in a thick cloak and hood up to her head.

*恐らく12～3歳だろう、小柄な少女が厚手の外套を纏い、頭までフードで覆い歩いている。*

Even from here, one can tell that the fabric of the cloak is of good quality.

*ここからでも、外套の生地が質の良い物である事が判る。*

It was a sign that the girl was living in a rich environment.

*それは少女が豊かな環境の元に生活している事を窺わせた。*

The girl's good skin, which peeks out from her hood, and the tip of her nose and mouth, which are well-shaped, make it easy to imagine the girl's capacity as well.

*フードから覗く血色の好い肌、形の良い鼻先や口元が、少女の器量の良さも容易に想像させる。*

&nbsp;

Grinning, the two men smiled again, a wild, thin smile.

*ニヤリ、と再び野卑た薄笑いを二人が浮かべた。*

&nbsp;

'That's a rich kid. What are you going to do? Hey."

*「ありゃ金持ちのガキだな。どうするよ？オイ」*

I'm sure I'll be fine on my own! It's good, isn't it? Heh heh heh.

*「ひへへ、良いトコのお嬢ちゃんみたいだしな…アレならオレ一人でも十分だぜ！良いんじゃ無ェか？へへっ」*

I'm sure you've got plenty of money! You've got enough money! You could be a hostage while we escape!

*「着てる物ひん剥けばそれなりの金になりそうだな…金も十分持ってんだろ！逃げる間の人質にもなりそうだしな！」*

And I can play with the skinny kid until I get away with it! Heh heh heh.

*「それに逃げ切るまで、ひん剥いたあのガキ使って遊んでも良さそうだ！ひへへ」*

"What? You like that kid?"

*「何だぁ？お前あんなガキが好みか？」*

What? I can use it well enough! If you don't do it, I'll do it myself!

*「あ？十分使えんだろ！お前ェがやら無ェならオレ一人でヤルけどよ！」*

I never said I wouldn't do it! I've been through a lot up to this point. It wouldn't hurt to have a little consolation!"

*「やら無いとは言ってねぇ！大体ここまで散々な目にあって来たんだ。ちったぁ慰めて貰ってもバチは当たんねよ！」*

Heh heh heh! Then it's settled!"

*「ひへへっ！なら決まりだ！」*

&nbsp;

With such self-centered logic, the two went on to further deepen their servile smiles.

*そんな自己中心的な論理で2人は更に卑俗な笑みを深めて行った。*

Then he made sure the girl showed her back and quickly ran out of the alleyway.

*そして少女が背中を見せたのを確認し、素早く路地裏から飛び出した。*

&nbsp;

What we have to do is simple.

*やる事は簡単だ。*

You can restrain them by force, silence them with a knife, restrain them with the rags you have, and carry them away as they are.

*力ずくで抑え込み、ナイフを突き付け黙らせ、持っているボロ布で拘束してそのまま運び去れば良い。*

Drawing up such a haphazard and sloppy plan, the two run toward the girl.

*そんな行き当たりバッタリで杜撰な計画を描き、二人は少女に向かい走り出す。*

A man spun a knife in his right hand as if he were familiar with it, and reached out with his left hand to hold the girl's mouth from behind.

*一人の男が右手の中のナイフを手慣れた様にクルリと回し、後ろから少女の口を押え様と左手を伸ばして行った。*

&nbsp;

When his hand was about to touch the girl, her figure was scratched out of sight.

*その手が少女に触れ様とした時、その姿が視界から掻き消えた。*

The next moment, the man felt his body floating in the air.

*次の瞬間、男は自分の身体が宙に浮いている事を感じた。*

Suddenly, the vision reflects the sky.

*唐突に視界が空を映す。*

At the same time something jumped into my body.

*同時に何かが自分の身体に飛び込んで来た。*

The sole is reduced to the dove tail without killing the momentum, and the contents come up to the man's throat.

*ソレは勢いも殺さず鳩尾に減り込み、男の喉元に内容物が上がって来る。*

Immediately after, he received a strong shock to the face and let go of consciousness as it was.

*直後、顔面に強い衝撃を受け、そのまま意識を手放した。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Two dirty men were folded in an unnatural position against the wall of a still-snowy back street.

*薄汚れた男が二人、まだ雪の残る裏通りの壁際に不自然な姿勢で折り重なっていた。*

The men jumped into a pile of crates stacked high on the wall, splitting and splattering the liquor bottles that were packed inside along with the crates.

*男たちは高く壁に積み上げられた木箱の山に飛び込み、箱と共に中に詰まっていた酒瓶も盛大に割り飛び散らせていた。*

The sound was quite loud, so many people peeked into the empty streets and opened their windows to see what was going on. Many people peeked into the empty streets and opened their windows to see what was going on.

*かなり派手な音を上げて居た為、何事か？と人通りの無かった道を覗き込む者、窓を開けて顔を出す者が数多く現れた。*

&nbsp;

The people were looking at a girl holding a large basket in both hands and looking down at the two men.

*人々の視線の先には、両手に大きな籠を抱え、二人の男を見下ろしている少女が居た。*

&nbsp;

The girl shook her head while holding the basket and dexterously lowered the hood that covered it.

*少女は籠を抱えたまま頭を揺すり、覆っていたフードを器用に降ろした。*

Her red hair, spilling from her hood, shimmered in the light. Released from the hood, her hair, which had been held in place by a picktail, shook as if it were bouncing.

*フードから零れた赤い髪が光を受けて煌めく。押えられていたフードから解放され、ピックテールに纏められた髪が弾ける様に揺れた。*

Her flaming hair shimmers like rubies through the light, and the overflowing sparkles dissolve into the air and disappear.

*焔の様な髪は光に透けてルビーの如き輝きを振り撒き、溢れた煌めきは大気に溶け消える。*

&nbsp;

Cobalt green eyes like the clear ocean twinkled.

*澄んだ海の様なコバルトグリーンの瞳が瞬いた。*

Her eyes are large and bright and seem to be overflowing with light.

*零れる様に大きな瞳は輝きを湛え、光が溢れているようだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In the sun-shadowed back alley, a glow danced only in one corner of it.

*陽の影る裏路地に、その片隅にだけ光りが舞っていた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People peering into the back streets could not take their eyes off the place.

*裏通りを覗き込む人々は其処から目が離せなくなっていた。*

I just kept looking at it as if I were dumbfounded.

*唯々、呆けた様にそれを見続けた。*

&nbsp;

The corner where its light dances.

*その光が舞う一角を。*

Tilt your head curiously and look down at the girl looking down at the men.

*不思議そうに小首を傾げ、男たちを見下ろす少女を。*

&nbsp;

Suzy Cloud with her shimmering red jade hair.

*紅玉の髪を煌めかせるスージィ・クラウドを。*
