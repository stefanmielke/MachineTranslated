# Episode 2: Suzy Feels Surprise

## 02話　スージィ驚きを覚える

For the time being, no one other than the protagonist will appear＾＾；

*当分、主人公以外の人間が出てきません＾＾；*

----------------

&nbsp;

A part of the forest was gouged out, emitting white smoke.

*森の一部が抉られ白煙を上げていた。*

&nbsp;

“No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no!”

*「いや、いやいや！いやいやいやいやいやいや！」*

&nbsp;

Seeing the “mark” I created again made me freak out.

*自分の作った『跡』を見て改めてビビる。*

&nbsp;

“It’s just a dash skill, right?! It’s a skill with no attack power?!”

*「只のダッシュ技だよ？！攻撃力無いスキルだよ？！」*

&nbsp;

The target was no longer a fragment.

*ターゲットだったモノは最早欠片も無い。*

&nbsp;

“Eh~~? Why? Is it because the level difference with the mob is too great? Even so, it’s too flashy just because it’s a dream, right?!”

*「えぇ～～？なんでぇ？Mobとレベル差があり過ぎって事？だとしても、夢だからって派手すぎでしょ！？」*

&nbsp;

With a crunching sound, the gouged and shattered trees began to collapse.

*メキメキと音を立て、抉り砕かれた木々が崩れ落ちていった。*

&nbsp;

“That mob was like a big bear… I think I could tell its name when I targeted it, but it blew up right away.”

*「でっかい熊みたいなMobだったなぁ……。タゲると名前も『判る』っぽいけど……、直ぐ爆ぜちゃったからなぁ」*

&nbsp;

Was it something like Nanto Bear? I muttered while letting a bead of sweat fall, as if to turn my eyes away from the gruesome scene I had created.

*ナントカ・ベアだったかな？　と、自分の抉った惨状から目を背けるように、一筋汗を垂らせながら呟いた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Startled by the resounding loud noise, many creatures fled the scene.

*響き渡る大音に驚き、多くの生物たちはその場から遠ざかるように逃げ出していた。*

&nbsp;

However, among them, there were those who were instead drawn to it.

*しかし、中には逆にそれで引き寄せられるモノ達もいる。*

Those who recognized themselves as “strong beings.”

*自らを『強者』と自覚するモノたち。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They were irritated; the sudden shock and loud noise had wounded their pride.

*ソレは苛立っていた、突然の衝撃と大音に動揺を覚えたことがソレのプライドを傷付けたのだ。*

&nbsp;

If they followed their instincts as living beings, they should swiftly distance themselves from any perceived threat.

*生物としての本能に従うのなら、何らかの脅威を感じたならば、速やかにそこから離れるべきだ。*

That would be fine for a beast without wisdom, but they were “strong beings.”

*知恵なき獣ならそれで良いだろう、だがソレは『強者』である。*

They could not leave the source of the threat unchallenged.

*自らに脅威を与えたものを、そのままにしてはおく訳にはいかない。*

&nbsp;

They needed to make it known to their opponent who they had bared their fangs at.

*誰に対し牙を向けたのかを、相手に知らしめる必要がある。*

&nbsp;

Without hiding their anger, they hurried toward the direction of the sound.

*ソレはその憤りを隠そうともせず、音の発した方向へと足を急がせた。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When they confirmed the location, they felt surprise once again.

*ソレがその場所を確認した時、改めて驚きを覚えた。*

Not at the devastation, but at the being that was there.

*その惨状にでは無い、そこに居た者に対してだ。*

A being that should not be in such a place.

*本来こんな場所には居る筈の無い者。*

A “human” they would normally have to go far from here, to the edge of the forest, to encounter.

*もっとここから遠い、この森の端まで行かなくては遭遇できない『人』だ。*

&nbsp;

Moreover, a “young female.”

*しかも『若い牝』だ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They felt their surprise and irritation transform into delight.

*ソレは驚きや苛立ちが悦びに変わるのを感じていた。*

At this point, the identity and cause of the loud noise no longer mattered.

*最早、大音を轟かせた正体も原因もどうでもいい。*

Before them was a rare and exquisite prey.

*目の前に滅多にお目にかかれない極上の獲物がいるのだ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A “human” could be easily subdued.

*『人』は簡単に抑え込める。*

Though there were occasionally those who wielded weapons, their meager blades could hardly scratch their fur.

*稀に武器を持っている者も居るが、奴らの貧相な刃物ではこちらの毛皮にはロクに傷など付けられない。*

It would be over with just a grip of their legs.

*脚で抑えればそれで終わりだ。*

Moreover, these creatures would make noise as soon as claws lightly dug into their flesh.

*それにこいつ等は、その身に爪を軽く立てるだけで直ぐに音を出す。*

Especially the sounds made by “females” were incredibly delightful.

*特に『牝』の出す音はとても美味い。*

&nbsp;

They would extract plenty of sounds and savor them before feasting on the flesh.

*タップリと音を絞り出させ、啜るように味わってから肉を喰らおう。*

Imagining the feast they could enjoy, their mouth, equipped with massive fangs reminiscent of a saber-toothed tiger, twisted in a grin.

*これから楽しめる饗膳を想い、サーベルタイガーを思わせる巨大な牙を備えた口元が歪む。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A massive form reminiscent of a black feline, reaching five meters, slowly sank into the ground as if crawling.

*５メートルに達する黒いネコ科を思わせる巨体がゆっくりと地面を這うように沈み込んだ。*

Two tentacles extending from its shoulders trembled, and as its golden eyes narrowed, its presence began to fade.

*肩口から延びる２本の触手が震え、金の眼がスッと細まると、その存在が薄まっていく。*

&nbsp;

【Invisibility】インヴィジビリティ

*【隠形】インヴィジビリティ*

By manipulating magical power, one can blend their existence into the space, making it impossible for others to recognize them.

*魔力操作で己の存在を空間に溶け込ませ、他者から認識する事を不可にする。*

A “human” could never find them.

*『人』では到底見つける事は出来ない。*

&nbsp;

There were those who could detect with magical power, but this could not be captured by a “human’s” level of magical energy.

*魔力を持って探知をする者も居るが『人』の魔力量程度でこれは捉えられない。*

They would pin down their prey and reveal themselves while digging in their claws.

*このまま組み伏せ爪を食込ませながら姿を現わせてやろう。*

Surely, they would produce a very delicious sound.

*きっと、とても美味い音を出してくれる。*

And with that cold pleasure, they leaped toward their prey.

*と冷ややかな愉悦に浸りながら獲物へと飛びかかった。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They opened their body to the right, twisting their upper body and swinging their arm as if throwing, slamming the blade down.

*身体を右に半身開き、そのまま上半身を捻り腕を放り投げる様に廻し、握ったブレードを叩きつける。*

With a flashy explosion, the creature that had leaped at them burst apart.

*派手な破裂音と共に飛びかかって来たモノは破裂した。*

&nbsp;

“Whoa!”

*「うわっぷ！」*

&nbsp;

Like a burst water balloon, black fur and flesh scattered everywhere.

*破裂した水風船の如く黒い毛皮と血肉が飛び散った。*

&nbsp;

“Ugh, it exploded again… It really is a grand overkill. Was that one called ‘Kuar Jaguar’? I wonder if the mobs around here are at the initial village level?”

*「うあああ、また爆ぜたぁ……。やっぱ盛大にオーバーキルか。……今のヤツは『クァル・ジャガー』って名前だったかな？この辺のMobは初期村クラスなんだろか？」*

&nbsp;

They muttered to themselves while gazing at the splattered flesh, brain matter, and fragments of internal organs.

*飛び散った血肉、脳漿や内臓の破片などを眺めながら独りごちた。*

&nbsp;

(This is quite a gruesome scene… but strangely, I’m okay with it? Am I really resistant to gore? It must be because it’s a dream.)

*（結構グロい状景なんだが……、何気に平気だな？オレってグロ耐性高かったのか？やっぱり夢だからだな）*

&nbsp;

They were satisfied with that thought.

*などと納得していた。*

&nbsp;

“But it seems I’ve figured out how to use the skill!”

*「でも、スキルの使い方も判ったっぽいし！」*

&nbsp;

It seemed that skills existed as images in their consciousness.

*スキルは意識の中にイメージとして有る様だ。*

There were no icons like in a game screen.

*ゲーム画面の様にアイコンがある訳では無い。*

It appeared that if they consciously wished to use a skill, it would activate.

*使いたいスキルを使いたいと意識すれば発動するようだ。*

It was almost like choosing whether to throw a straight punch or a hook.

*ほぼパンチをストレートにするかフックにするかを選択する様な物だ。*

&nbsp;

“Using magic feels similar, right? For now, let’s enchant it.”

*「魔法を使うのも同じ感じかな？とりあえずエンチャはしとくか」*

&nbsp;

Saying that, they raised both hands above their head while still holding the sword and began to dance as if swaying.

*そう言うと剣を持ったまま両手を頭上に掲げ、揺れるように踊り始めた。*

A whisper-like chant leaked from their mouth.

*その口元から囁く様な唱が漏れ出す。*

As if in sync with the chant, the sounds of instruments began to resonate.

*すると唱に合わせる様に楽器の音色が響き始めた。*

&nbsp;

Horns, lutes, harps, drums, guitars, organs—various instruments were played by small fairies that appeared and began to perform.

*ホーン、リュート、ハープ、ドラム、ギター、オルガン様々な楽器を演奏する小妖精が現れ演奏を奏でる。*

&nbsp;

HP, MP increase and recovery values, attack, magic, speed, physical and magical defense, evasion, critical hit occurrence and damage, movement speed, resistance to various attributes, resistance to mental and physical abnormalities.

*HP、MPの増加及び回復値、攻撃、魔法、速度、物理魔法防御、回避、クリティカルの発生及びダメージ力、移動速度、各種属性の抵抗値、精神や身体の異常に対する抵抗力。*

One after another, their physical abilities significantly increased.

*等々、身体能力が次々と大幅に増加していく。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(I can use magic in a similar way. Moreover, it seems I can set it up like a macro? Should I try out skill combos too…?)

*（魔法も同じ感じで使えるな。しかもマクロ組むようにセットして使えるっぽい？スキルのコンボも試してみるか……）*

&nbsp;

Eventually, the small fairies that had finished their performance disappeared.

*やがて演奏を終えた小妖精たちが消えて行く。*

&nbsp;

“Although a lot scattered due to that loud noise earlier, there are still quite a few mobs nearby.”

*「さっきのでかい音で随分散っちゃったけど、まだ近くにはMobは結構居るな」*

&nbsp;

Looking around and using their own exploration ability to confirm the positions of the mobs.

*周りを見渡しレーダーで……自らの探索能力で、Mobの位置を確認をする。*

&nbsp;

They licked their upper lip with their tongue.

*舌でペロリと上唇を舐めた。*

&nbsp;

“Well then, let’s give it a little try!”

*「さて、そんじゃちょいとばかり試してみよっかなっ！」*

&nbsp;

With a slightly confident smile, they dashed toward the nearest enemy.

*少し強気な笑みを浮かべ、最も近い敵へと向けて飛び出した。*
