# A-63 Worries and Consultations

<b>

<b>

<b>

After defeating the nine tails in the S-rank dungeon, I began to think that perhaps I had been deceiving myself all along.

I saved the world and reunited with Sera and the others, and I was very happy—fulfilled—but was I really just convincing myself of that?

<b>

Looking back, when I first soloed Venom in the game Tempest, the strong feeling I had was one of 'loss.' The emotion of having no more enemies left, of having nothing else to do.

<b>

If this were still in the game Tempest, I could set a goal to reach the top of party battles solo. I could also have the expectation that the developers would provide new strong foes.

But what about now? With Venom gone and no other rankers around, what can I enjoy as an explorer? What should I aim for?

<b>

Perhaps because I was thinking about such things, even when praised by Neska and Niz, and even when Sera said, "As expected of you," I could only feel a slight happiness.

<b>

Since then, even when I returned to the royal capital of Palmour and met with His Majesty, and after reuniting with Fenon and the others, that thought kept swirling in my mind.

<b>

<b>

After returning to the inn in the royal capital and saying goodnight to Fenon, Shiri, and Sera, only Noah remained in my room.

<b>

"Weren't you supposed to wait for Shin and the others to grow up?"

<b>

I thought I was maintaining my composure, but it clearly didn't matter to Noah, who could use mind-reading.

I was able to deceive Sera and the others, though... Isn't reading minds a bit unfair?

However, I didn't have the energy to point out, "Don't read my mind without permission," and I started a normal conversation with Noah.

<b>

"I was planning to take my time. No, rather, I still think I should. It's wrong to take unnecessary risks. ...Somehow, being at the top is boring once you actually get there. It's not like I'm defending the champion's seat or anything."

<b>

"That's quite a luxurious worry, isn't it?"

<b>

"Shut up. Ah... If this were a game, there would be updates or something... but that's impossible in reality."

<b>

When I said that, Noah let out a deep sigh as if to say, "What a pain."

It was probably because I was saying something childish and selfish.

<b>

"Hey, you shouldn't forget that dungeon exploration is a matter of life and death, okay? You might think of it as a game, but it's a profession where many people actually die."

<b>

"I know. ...Maybe while giving advice to other explorers, I should find another hobby."

<b>

Gambling doesn't suit me... How about fishing?

Speaking of which, I wonder if there are any sports-like competitions in this world.

<b>

"Well, if I were to give a general opinion, if your husband is diving into danger every day, it wouldn't be good for his mental state. I don't know what they think, though."

<b>

Well... that's true.

If something bad were to happen to me, I'm sure they would shed tears.

I never want to see Sera and the others sad again. So, I shouldn't dive into dungeons... The answer is easy to come to, but if asked whether I can accept it, the answer is no.

<b>

"Well, you don't have to worry alone. You have plenty of companions, don't you? Why not consult with them? Of course, I'm here to help too."

<b>

"…Thanks for that."

<b>

As Noah suggested, maybe I should consult them once... What should I do from now on? If it were someone else, they'd probably say, "Figure it out yourself," but I feel like Sera and the others would genuinely think it through for me.

<b>

"Hmm, so that's why SR has been off since yesterday."

<b>

The next morning, I consulted the three who came to my room, but it seemed they had already noticed my discomfort. That's strange? I thought I had been able to hide it.

<b>

"In that case... why not try clearing all the S-rank dungeons for now? It might lead to something next."

<b>

"That's a great idea, Shiri! SR-san, let's travel around the countries and conquer the S-rank dungeons! Ah, but the expansion of Lindell should be completed soon, so I'd like to relax there for a while too."

<b>

"Right... then how about going to other countries every month? But if we're going to do it, I'd like to conquer all the dungeons with all the ASR members."

<b>

"Then should we go to Aldia again and clear it with these five? We have plenty of time, so I don't mind at all."

<b>

The four of them, excluding me, were chatting excitedly, seemingly enjoying the conversation.

Huh? Wasn't this supposed to be a more serious discussion?

<b>

"Ah... that's fine, but are Sera and the others okay with this? You know, I'm trying to do something that isn't exactly safe again."

<b>

When I said that while scratching my cheek, for some reason, the three of them except Noah looked puzzled for a moment before bursting into laughter. Huh? Did I say something strange?

<b>

"Hehe, SR says funny things. After all, for explorers, every day is a matter of life and death, you know? Well, if SR feels it's dangerous, I might forcibly stop you... but you won't lose that easily, right?"

<b>

"Of course, if it means living safely in the royal capital for the rest of my life, I'd be fine with that, but I really like seeing SR fighting in the dungeons, full of life, you know?"

<b>

"Besides, if it's prepared by that Idea-sama, I don't think there would be dungeons that SR couldn't win against. I just have a feeling that you would be fine."

<b>

"Well, if it gets dangerous for my brother, I'll protect him, so it's okay~"

<b>

None of the four said anything negative.

Though they each expressed it differently, somehow it felt like they were telling me, "Just do what you want." The atmosphere in the room was so warm that it made me feel foolish for worrying.

<b>

"Having companions is nice, isn't it?"

<b>

As I watched the cheerful and lively conversation, Noah poked me in the side with his elbow, grinning. Well, that's true.

<b>

This atmosphere is something I couldn't experience during my gaming days.
