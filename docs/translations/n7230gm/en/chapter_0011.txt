# 10 Sera = Bernot

<b>

This is a story from Sera's perspective.

Please understand that it has a digest-like feel m(*_ _)m

<b>

"Let me join your party! Please!"

<b>

I bowed my head to the party that had just emerged from the B-rank dungeon—'The Trail of Thunder.' I felt sorry for bothering them when they were tired, but I had no choice; I couldn't afford to care about their circumstances.

<b>

If my father saw this, he would probably scold me, saying, "Don't bow your head so lightly," but I couldn't afford to think like that.

My friend's life was at stake.

If bowing my head could increase the chances of saving my friend, I would do it as many times as needed. I wouldn't mind pressing my forehead against the ground.

<b>

Shin, the leader of the party, was someone I knew. He was close to my brother, who belonged to the knight order, and we occasionally spoke because of that relationship.

<b>

The two women who were Shin's companions were looking at him, seeking his judgment. As for Shin, he glanced around, then let out a sigh.

<b>

"No good. You're just trying to help the princess, right?"

<b>

"—What!? You knew!?"

<b>

"You're loud. ...Well, we're the closest ones to conquering a B-rank dungeon, so of course, we'd get approached."

<b>

"I'm a level 60 swordsman! If you let me join your party, the chances of conquering it will increase, right!?"

<b>

Upon hearing my words, Shin scratched his head, looking annoyed.

<b>

"That's the problem. You're definitely going to ignore danger and rush in. The ones who will suffer because of that are me and these two."

<b>

As he said this, he placed a hand on the shoulders of his companions beside him.

<b>

"We're making an effort too, but doing it within a month is just impossible. We might manage it in the fourth layer, but..."

<b>

That wouldn't mean anything. What value is there in breaking through just the fourth layer?

<b>

"That's enough... then at least help me conquer a C-rank dungeon. I'll manage the rest on my own."

<b>

I wouldn't rely on these guys' strength anymore. I would handle it by myself.

<b>

"That's not going to work either. Why should we help you commit suicide?"

<b>

"I'm not planning to commit suicide! I'm trying to save my friend—" "That's what I'm talking about."

<b>

Before I could finish my sentence, Shin interrupted me.

<b>

"You plan to challenge a B-rank dungeon alone, right? That's what we call suicide."

<b>

Shin spoke in a tone that felt almost like a lecture.

Given how desperate I was, his attitude felt like he was mocking me.

<b>

"I was a fool to rely on you."

<b>

I said that and turned on my heel.

It was already late. Tomorrow, I'll go directly to the guild and negotiate.

<b>

<b>

☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆

<b>

<b>

Negotiating with the guild also ended in failure.

It wasn't a discussion that could be called negotiation; it felt more like a half-threat.

<b>

On top of that, I was handed a ten-day suspension. Prohibiting dungeon exploration was likely Shin's idea. It was infuriating.

<b>

At such a frustrating time, I was told to guard a certain young man.

I needed to become stronger as soon as possible, yet if I was busy guarding someone, I couldn't train on my own. My irritation only escalated.

<b>

Then came the face-to-face meeting.

<b>

Surprisingly, he—SR—wasn't a resident of this world. If he was such a valuable person, then it made sense that he needed protection. The introduction was so absurd that I was able to calm down a little.

<b>

He was dressed in commoner's attire, so when he mentioned royalty, I was shocked. But if he was summoned, it was only natural that he would have connections. It made sense that I had to sign a contract before coming to this room.

<b>

His jet-black, supple hair barely brushed his eyes.

He had large, double-lidded eyes and wore a somewhat relaxed expression. Overall, he was well-balanced—almost as if he were crafted. Like Shin, he would probably be adored by women.

<b>

After this, I was supposed to have a mock battle with this young man.

<b>

I had heard from the guild master that he was below level 10, but upon listening to him, it seemed he was level 5. Moreover, he was a low-tier class.

I couldn't believe he thought he could challenge me. Ignorance is terrifying.

For his sake, I should probably teach him about my own helplessness.

<b>

<b>

I had been thinking lightly like that. However, his words made me reconsider.

<b>

<b>

"There's no way I'd be scared. After all, Sera-san seems really weak, and you haven't even cleared a C-rank dungeon, right? It seems like I could win easily."

<b>

Hasn’t even cleared a C-rank dungeon—seriously?

<b>

You think you know anything, you newcomer!

Do you have any idea how much effort I've put in to get this far!?

<b>

His words, which seemed to mock all my past efforts, made my head boil.

<b>

Moreover, he started saying that it would be enough if I landed a hit to win.

I was completely underestimated. And ridiculed. My irritation flared up again—no, it was even heightened.

<b>

"If you say that's fine, then let's make that the condition for our match. Don't worry, I'll kill you in one hit."

<b>

Shaking with anger, I said this to him.

But he remained unfazed by my words; in fact, he smiled.

<b>

<b>

☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆

<b>

<b>

The mock battle began, and I realized something after dodging his sword a few times.

<b>

This man—he's quite strong.

<b>

His gaze seemed to be on my sword, but in reality, he wasn't watching it much. Rather, he seemed to focus more on my hands, feet, and eyes.

<b>

If I threw in a feint, that would be the end of it.

<b>

Such a simple thought was quickly shattered. Nothing hit. Not even a graze.

He easily dodged my sword strikes with only the minimum necessary movements. It felt like he was dancing. Yet, contrary to his movements, his expression looked incredibly bored.

<b>

And the time limit was approaching.

<b>

Frustration—anxiety—helplessness—various emotions mixed together, and I instinctively thrust towards SR's eyes.

<b>

This attack was foul—something that shouldn't be done in a mock battle. Blinding the opponent could lead to death if luck was bad.

<b>

Though I said "die" and "kill," I didn't actually want that to happen. Of course, I didn't think it was okay to blind someone. But in my current state of anger, I couldn't stop the attack.

<b>

The tip of my sword was closing in on his eye. Yet, for some reason, SR stepped towards me.

At that moment, he no longer wore the bored expression from earlier; instead, he had a smile at the corner of his mouth, looking as if he was enjoying himself.

<b>

The memories after that are hazy.

<b>

I had somehow lost consciousness, and before I knew it, I was in the guild's treatment room.

According to the guild master, he had dodged my attack and landed a hit on my jaw. I had apparently collapsed without resistance from the impact to my brain.

<b>

I couldn't accept it—surely it was just a fluke.

<b>

To acknowledge his strength would mean acknowledging that all my efforts were in vain. There's no way I could accept that easily.

<b>

Afterward, I ended up being assigned to guard him, and we headed to an E-rank dungeon together. However, all I was allowed to do was wait outside.

With that time, I could have leveled up a bit in the dungeon, but all I could do was practice my swings.

<b>

He would probably soon experience pain and come to rely on me.

Worrying about the communication magic tool, I began to practice my swings in silence.

<b>

<b>

SR emerged from the dungeon after about two hours, just as he had declared.

He had conquered the E-rank dungeon—reporting the fact without any visible injuries and without boasting.

<b>

And unbelievably, SR then said he was heading to a D-rank dungeon next.

<b>

Even though he was an annoying person, I had to stop him. It was reckless.

<b>

However, he had already conquered the D-rank dungeon before me, and I had to admit it. I didn't want to.

<b>

SR brushed off my persuasion with a grin and, in the end, entered the D-rank dungeon without even properly equipping himself.

<b>

While he was inside the dungeon, I couldn't even bring myself to practice my swings; I just waited for the communication magic tool to ring.

<b>

Then, three hours later. He emerged from the dungeon and, as if it were a matter of course, reported that he had conquered it.

I had forgotten my anger, and I couldn't even be surprised; I was just dumbfounded. What on earth was this man—

<b>

And with a somewhat tired expression, he uttered words of astonishment.

<b>

"It's still before 5... I'm sorry for making you wait, but I'll do two more rounds. I can't afford to waste time."

<b>

Ignoring my gaping, foolish expression, he casually re-entered the D-rank dungeon as if he were going for a stroll.
