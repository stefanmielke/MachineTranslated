# 105 The Other Half

<b>

Meanwhile...

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The moment I selected reincarnation displayed on the window, my vision was filled with white and sky blue.

<b>

"…Huh? Above the clouds…?"

<b>

There's no footing... It's really high and scary.

There's no wind, and even though it's bright, I can't see the sun. It's neither hot nor cold. Well, it's a game, so anything goes.

<b>

I wonder how high this place is; looking down, I only see scattered clouds and can't even see the ground. If I fell, I'd definitely die, but for some reason, I'm floating.

<b>

Could this be some kind of event to change jobs to a Demon King?

Even though my level and items are reset, if I can change jobs to the rumored Demon King, it wouldn't hurt at all.

<b>

Still, what does it mean that "I can't return to my original world"?

<b>

"I have been looking forward to meeting you."

<b>

Suddenly—truly out of nowhere.

<b>

In the empty space, a girl in a kimono appeared.

A long kimono with various colors mixed in, like red, white, orange, and pink. The ends floated as if drifting in the air.

Her light brown hair was tied up in a bun, and a luxurious hairpin with decorations swayed above her head.

<b>

"Wow... A new character. This one has a strangely elaborate appearance."

<b>

"Hey! Don't refer to me as 'this one'! I am the Creator God!"

<b>

"Haha! My bad, my bad, you're the Creator God, huh? Got it."

<b>

The production team really put in a lot of effort. The responses are strangely realistic, and as a character that can only be seen by defeating Venom solo, it feels like such a waste.

If they made it this elaborate, shouldn't they let more people see it?

<b>

"This is not within a game."

<b>

"…Oh. Is this a heavenly setting before reincarnation?"

<b>

"Yes. Your understanding is mostly correct, but the premise is wrong. This is not a virtual space; it is reality. If you cannot believe it, you can try logging out."

<b>

Suddenly, this girl started talking about "logging out," which is very meta.

Reluctantly, I followed the self-proclaimed Creator God girl’s instructions and displayed the menu screen to check for the logout button. Just as she said, the logout button was missing.

<b>

The production is elaborate.

<b>

"I told you it's not a production. Should I tell you the names of your parents who died in a traffic accident? Or should I talk about when you quit your job?"

<b>

…Huh? Wait a minute.

<b>

"I don't recall giving such information to the game."

<b>

"I am the Creator God. There is nothing I do not know."

<b>

Puffing out her flat chest, the girl in the kimono wore a confident expression. It's strangely infuriating, but honestly, that's not the point right now. I'm seriously about to lose my mind.

<b>

—So it's a dream!

<b>

"Unfortunately, it is not a dream."

<b>

"You're reading my mind—could you not do that?"

<b>

Just in case.

If this girl is really the Creator God, I should correct my tone. I should treat her politely, and even if this is indeed a game, I have nothing to lose. If someone sees me, I might get mocked on a bulletin board or something.

<b>

Stay calm. Stay calm.

<b>

"You won't wake up even if you pinch your cheeks. You should accept it already. Rokudo Shuui."

<b>

"Haha... Of course, you know my name."

<b>

Is this person really a god?

If so, why did she make contact with me?

<b>

In light novels or manga, when people meet gods, they usually die after getting hit by a truck, right?

<b>

"There are various circumstances. Your other half is about to be killed by Venom, so it's time for me to intervene."

<b>

"…Other half? Killed by Venom?"

<b>

I don't understand the meaning.

What do you mean by other half? Am I split in two?

Besides, I just defeated Venom a moment ago.

<b>

The Creator God said, "Please sit here," and then made a carpet and kotatsu appear. On the table, there were four mandarins stacked in a pyramid shape.

<b>

It seems like the conversation is going to be long.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

While watching the image projected in the air and munching on a mandarin, I listened to the story of another me—Esuar's life in another world. By the way, the Creator God ate three mandarins. I only had one.

<b>

If I believe the Creator God's story, it seems my soul has been split, and the other me is struggling to save the world. What the heck is that?

<b>

"What is this harem? This guy should explode right now as a real charmer. And aren't Sera, Phenom, and Shiri too cute? Why is this idiot doing nothing? Moreover, this guy's inventory still has Sera's panties in it. What is he planning to do? That's unfair; I want them too—no, I want to go to that world."

<b>

Various thoughts spilled out of my mouth. More like, voices of jealousy.

<b>

"That is you yourself. Your consciousness is divided, but the fundamental thought process is the same. The only difference is appearance."

<b>

I realized while eating the mandarin that the body I currently have—it's not Esuar but Rokudo Shuui. I was just a 33-year-old in loungewear.

<b>

"I can't believe it... I saw the battle scenes, and in the early stages, he almost lost to a Cyclops."

<b>

If he's the other half, then the other me should be doing a bit better. Still, he defeated Venom at the peak.

Well, I thought the last scene where he raised his arm was a bit cool.

<b>

"Well, that's about the situation. Do you have any questions?"

<b>

Of course.

I have a mountain of them.

<b>

"What is this world, to begin with? If it's based on a game, it's strange for a Destroyer God to appear in the game, and if the game is based on this world, it's odd for Japanese food to appear, right?"

<b>

"That's a valid question. To put it simply, that world was created by Noah's kid based on numerous games on Earth, solely to defeat Venom. And based on this world, a game called Tempest was created."

<b>

…So that's how it was.

Knowing the world's origins doesn't help much, but it's out of intellectual curiosity.

<b>

So, next.

<b>

"The Creator God over there said my time is stopped, right? But I'm moving; what does that mean?"

<b>

"That kid's tricks shouldn't work on me. Just manipulating dimensions is a piece of cake."

<b>

That god over there seems unfortunate. It feels like all their efforts went to waste.

<b>

"So, what about the fact that I'm about to be killed by Venom? It seems like I'm still fighting, but if this continues, Esuar will probably win, right?"

<b>

Looking at the image projected in the air, the other me—Esuar had just shot down five of Venom's legs. There was a look of ease on his face.

<b>

That makes sense—Esuar is fighting a Destroyer God that seems to be moving slower than the Venom he fought in the game.

If this Esuar shares the same thoughts as I do, he must be having the same impression.

<b>

"If that world is exactly the same as in the game. In a game, enemies that are too strong to defeat won't be prepared, but in reality, unreasonable things often happen."

<b>

"Ah... So it's like an unavoidable attack."

<b>

"That's about it."

<b>

Sorry, Esuar. It seems like you're going to die.

Though you're supposedly half of my soul, it feels like someone else's business because this Esuar looks nothing like me. What a handsome guy.

<b>

Moreover, knowing such a future, this Creator God of Earth must be much better than that god named Noah.

As I silently joined my hands in prayer, the Creator God opened her mouth and said, "Over there."

<b>

"Your other self cannot be killed. Reincarnation cannot happen frequently. I would be sad if you died."

<b>

"So... what does that mean?"

<b>

I thought for a moment but couldn't understand, so I gave up and asked normally.

<b>

I held my breath and waited for the Creator God's response.

She smiled brightly and looked straight into my eyes.

<b>

And with that expression, as if casually asking, "Could you buy me some ice cream?" she said:

<b>

<b>

"You will go and be killed in place of Esuar."

<b>

<b>

… 

<b>

…… 

<b>

………… 

<b>

…Um, Creator God?

Did you not just say, "I would be sad if you died," a moment ago?
