We—rather, when Neska-san saw my figure, she froze, and after moving her mouth in a fluster, she quickly sat down properly and rubbed her head against the ground.

<b>

"I-I-I-I apologize for showing you such an embarrassing sight! I-I’m sorry for not being able to greet you at the guild!!"

<b>

Neska-san shouted with a trembling voice directed at the floor. Her father was standing there in a daze, watching his daughter's bowing. I really wish she would stop. She hasn't done anything wrong.

In the silent store, the cheerful voices of children who know nothing of our situation can be heard. It seems they are excited about menko. I wish I could join them.

Sera and the others were watching the Neska family with wry smiles, but since they didn't seem to intend to intervene, I reluctantly decided to handle it.

<b>

"Um, first of all, why are you apologizing so much? For now, please raise your head—no, just act normally. We don’t find Neska-san unpleasant at all."

<b>

"—Huh!? You know my name!?"

<b>

"I've heard it a few times, and I just saw your face at the guild a moment ago. You noticed me quite well, didn’t you? I’m wearing a light disguise, after all."

<b>

Saying that, I twirled my bangs with my fingertips. I guess people who know my face would notice me just from my hair color.

<b>

"Of course! I stayed awake with my eyelids pried open to watch that heavenly match, and it even appeared in my dreams, so I won't mistake the face of Lord SR!"

<b>

"Calling it 'Lord'... you don’t have to flatter me that much, you know? Fenon and Sera are nobles, so maybe it’s necessary—" "It's fine." "—but it would help if you treated me normally as an explorer, so I wouldn't feel so stiff."

<b>

When I said that, Neska-san slowly stood up while glancing at our expressions. Then she straightened her back to the point where it could be said she was overdoing it, with her fingers pointed straight in a salute posture.

<b>

"...Are you SR? The ASR? Then those girls behind you are—"

<b>

The store owner, her father, shifted his gaze from his frozen daughter to us.

<b>

"They are members Sera, Fenon, Shiri, and Noah."

<b>

"No way—The Sword Princess and the First Princess..."

<b>

Saying that, the father froze in place.

Seeing the two of them frozen and unable to move, I couldn't help but chuckle. They are quite the similar pair.

It seems that a lot of things piled up, and their brains were nearing capacity. Especially the store owner had said he was bad with honorifics, so I felt a bit sorry for him.

So, I decided to throw them a little lifeline.

<b>

"Fenon and Sera don’t need to use polite language, right? Or is it still a problem in noble terms?"

<b>

"No, we are currently visiting the Palmour Kingdom as explorers, and while there are many people around, here we are the only ones. Besides, we are in disguise, so there’s no problem. Also, I believe SR doesn’t particularly like this kind of thing, right?"

<b>

First, with a cute smile, Fenon answered like that,

<b>

"I don't mind either. Let’s just follow the husband's wishes!"

<b>

Sera replied, her ears slightly reddening.

If she's embarrassed, she doesn't have to force herself to say it... but well, I suppose that's one of her good points... anyway, both of them are cute.

<b>

"Well, it seems that's the case, so you don’t have to worry about it. Especially since I’m originally a commoner, I’m not used to being spoken to like this."

<b>

I scratched my head and conveyed that to the two of them.

I still have some doubts about whether it properly reached the stiff pair, but it should be fine. The father managed to respond with a hesitant "Ah, ah."

<b>

<b>

Before long, Neska-san and the store owner—Logu-san—recovered from their petrified state and managed to calm down by saying, "At least stop using honorifics with us."

We, the Lindell group, waited for them to regain their composure—though it might not have been necessary, we decided to take a look around the store for now. Since we don't have much time to spare, we should make effective use of it.

<b>

"Oh! A bamboo helicopter! How nostalgic."

<b>

I picked up the toy that was lined up and brought it to my face to examine it closely.

It was well-maintained, and the edges were rounded to prevent injuries. Since children would likely handle it, they probably took care in that regard.

<b>

As I pinched it between my index finger and thumb and spun it, Sera peered curiously at my hands.

<b>

"Hmm... I believe this will rise when spun, right?"

<b>

"That's right. It’s doing a good job. It's polished nicely, so it’s smooth."

<b>

Saying that, I stroked the wing part with my fingers. Sera seemed to mimic me, tracing the wing with her index finger as well.

<b>

"...It really is. Can I try it out a bit?"

<b>

With her eyes sparkling, Sera asked, and I replied, "Since we're indoors, let’s be careful not to break anything, just a little," before handing her the bamboo helicopter. She seemed to know how to launch it, as she brought her palms together and pinched the handle of the bamboo helicopter between them.

<b>

And then,

<b>

"—Here it goes!"

<b>

It broke.

It shattered into beautiful pieces.

She might have thought she was controlling her strength, but it seems her STR worked more than expected. The bamboo helicopter made a cracking sound and scattered all over the store.

<b>

Neska-san, Logu-san, and our party members all looked surprised and turned their eyes toward the culprit. I smiled wryly and quickly brushed off the fragments that landed on my clothes.

<b>

"……Ugh."

<b>

As for the culprit, she looked at me with tears welling in her eyes, as if seeking help. That expression was exactly like a child who had broken a toy. I could clearly hear her inner voice saying, "What should I do?" Compensation, compensation.

And to think she’s called the "Sword Princess"… If someone who admires her saw this, their impression would surely change greatly.

<b>

Yeah. My wife may be a bit clumsy, but she’s very cute.
