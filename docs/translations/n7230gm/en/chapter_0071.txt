# 68 Construction Site

<b>

<b>

<b>

At the duke's residence.

<b>

As the four of us exchanged opinions about this and that, Mr. Lorenz's invited contractor arrived in the reception room where we were.

He looked to be in his fifties, a clean-cut man. His name seems to be Mr. Roberto.

<b>

It seems he was aware of me and Sera, who aren't as well-known as Fenon, and he kept making flattering remarks about us.

<b>

Since I stood out so much in the martial arts tournament, it's not surprising that my face is recognized. His excessive praise made my back itch.

<b>

However, I didn't feel any unpleasantness from it, and Mr. Roberto, despite being in front of the princess, didn't seem flustered at all. Perhaps he has enough experience to be called to the duke's residence.

<b>

After discussing the details of the building for several hours, we went with Mr. Roberto to the actual site to decide on the construction location.

He drove several stakes with red handkerchiefs attached to the tips into the ground and seemed to be getting ready, politely greeting us before heading back.

<b>

<b>

"This place is seriously amazing. I'm glad we came to see it."

<b>

It's located roughly halfway between a B-rank dungeon and an A-rank dungeon.

It's a wonderful location that can be reached in about a 10-minute walk from either dungeon.

Furthermore, this spot is elevated like a small hill, and from the highest point, we could overlook the entire surrounding area. The view is fantastic.

<b>

Tempest didn't have the function to build a new house, and I hadn't considered looking at a place like this before.

<b>

The small farming village that had become part of the scenery scattered throughout the game is gone, and it's unclear if this terrain even existed in Tempest.

For that reason, I'm feeling very fresh right now.

<b>

I decided to lie down and enjoy the natural cushion while looking up at the sky.

<b>

"Indeed, this is an ideal place for us who frequent dungeons. I'm looking forward to two months from now."

<b>

Sera said this as she sat down right next to me and looked up at the sky as well. Her bright red hair flowed gently in the wind. She looked like a painting.

<b>

"Time flies when you're leveling up."

<b>

When I said that, she glanced at Fenon and Shiri, who were admiring the scenery a little distance away, and said with a wry smile, "That might be true for you, Esuar."

<b>

"…I'm fine, but being inside a dungeon is more nerve-wracking than I imagined. It's a place where monsters could attack at any moment. It would help if you could be a little considerate towards Fenon and Shiri."

<b>

She said this with an apologetic expression.

It's unusual for Sera to show such a face.

<b>

"Since we go to the dungeon almost every day, do you think we should reduce the frequency a bit?"

<b>

"That's true. I can't say for sure since I haven't asked them directly."

<b>

...Hmm.

<b>

It's not like the world will end if I don't help them level up, so I'm fine either way. Just like with the Thunderbolt Trail, we're already at the forefront of this world.

<b>

Going into dungeons with them is enjoyable in a leisurely way.

It's also fine to enjoy battles alone.

<b>

"Fenon and Shiri would probably dive into dungeons without rest if Esuar wished for it. If we don't keep an eye on them, they might accumulate fatigue without realizing it."

<b>

"Ah... especially Fenon seems likely to do that."

<b>

"Right?"

<b>

As she said, it might be better to increase the number of rest days a bit.

Unlike in the game, dungeons in this world are literally a "life-or-death" place for the people here. Of course, I'm diving in with my life on the line now, but the difference in experience is clear. Especially regarding high-difficulty dungeons.

<b>

Even a B-rank dungeon, which I wouldn't consider high-difficulty, is a top-class dangerous place for them. Even though they've gained some experience in C-rank dungeons, if they dive into such places every day, they would indeed become mentally exhausted.

<b>

Right now, I'm the leader of this party.

<b>

As Sera said, I need to keep a close eye on the members. Unlike during the game, I'm not solo anymore.

<b>

I sprang up with a strong push and waved to Fenon and Shiri, calling out, "Hey!" They quickly ran over to me.

<b>

"What is it?"

<b>

"What are we playing?" Fenon said, looking at me with puppy-like eyes.

<b>

"I was talking to Sera, and I was thinking of reducing the frequency of our dungeon explorations a bit. Until now, we had one day off every seven days, but how about adding another day off? Specifically—let's say we take a break every three days of dungeon diving."

<b>

When I said that, Fenon's face lit up with joy, and she clasped her hands in front of her chest.

<b>

"If that's the case, how about we make those extra days off our outing days!? Of course, Esuar can come along too!"

<b>

She said this with such excitement, as if she couldn't even fathom me declining.

<b>

I had actually been considering going alone to an A-rank dungeon on that extra day, but spending leisurely time with them is also important. Besides, I can't bring myself to say something like "I'm going to the dungeon" to Fenon in her current state without feeling guilty.

<b>

"Haha, I got it. Then let's all relax on the extra day off."

<b>

"Yeah, that might be good. We don't have to force ourselves to go out; since we're building a new house, spending time at home is also nice, right?"

<b>

"When that time comes, I'll do my best with the cooking!"

<b>

Shiri, who had been listening to the conversation, also made a determined pose, flexing her muscles and tapping them with her other hand. It looks so soft and squishy. Please let me touch those soft-looking arms.

<b>

"…Ah, ahem."

<b>

To hide the slight impure thoughts that had arisen, I put on a serious expression and clapped my hands twice.

<b>

"We'll be frequenting this B-rank dungeon in Leinas for a while. Fenon and Shiri, don't let your guard down just because we're here. If you get hit in the wrong spot, it could easily send you to the afterlife. Also, Sera, even though you achieved good results in the martial arts tournament, I still see some rough edges. Don't be complacent; handle everything carefully, one step at a time. Understood?"

<b>

"Yes!" "Understood!" "Got it!"

<b>

The three of them responded with enthusiastic words.

Looking at them, I feel a sense of being the party leader.

<b>

Perhaps various trials will come our way in the future. They might be caused by illnesses like Fenon's or by formidable enemies that I struggle against.

<b>

But I felt that if I fought alongside them—if they supported me by my side, I could overcome any hardship.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Yes.

<b>

<b>

<b>

As long as they don't disappear from this world.
