# 108 Who Was Being Manipulated...?

<b>

<b>

<b>

In an attempt to protect me from Venom's attack, SR-kun had to bear the magic of annihilation— or so I thought.

<b>

I heard a thud from beneath my feet.

<b>

Someone who was not SR-kun, bleeding from the left shoulder, muttered, "Damn it..." but immediately pushed their hands against the ground and stood up.

The speed of their movement was abnormally quick, as if they had known in advance that they would receive a potentially fatal attack.

<b>

"—Tch, I let my guard down... I thought I could finally achieve a peaceful death..."

<b>

There was nothing from his left shoulder down. It seemed that Venom had destroyed it right at the shoulder joint, leaving his left arm abandoned on the ground.

<b>

"—Who are you...?"

<b>

I recognized the figure from behind.

However, my heart screamed, "That can't be!"

<b>

He shouldn't be here.

After all, one half of Rokudo Shuui should still be immobilized on Earth.

<b>

Yet he looked undeniably like the Rokudo Shuui I had been observing all along.

He picked up the white lotus that had been rolling on the ground with his right hand and, staggering, walked towards Venom, plunging the blade straight into the center of its eye without hesitation.

His physique, face— even his clothing were all different, yet his movements were unmistakably those of SR-kun.

Could it be that he really is?

<b>

Rokudo Shuui-kun pinned Venom down with his foot and stabbed again at the area where the effect of the white light was manifesting.

<b>

"Make sure to finish it off properly."

<b>

Without caring that I was there, he repeatedly stabbed Venom with the white lotus. Gradually, the depth of the blade increased, and eventually, it pierced through. This time, there was no doubt that Venom would not move again.

<b>

Then he fell backward. He didn't even attempt to break his fall, making a painful sound.

<b>

"What is happening...? —Huh!? I need to treat him quickly!"

<b>

For a moment, I was stunned, but I gathered the remaining strength to create an elixir to treat the person in front of me. I was about to sprinkle it on the wound. If I didn't act quickly, he would bleed to death.

<b>

However, my hand was stopped by something.

Despite there being nothing physically obstructing me, my arm wouldn't move even a millimeter.

<b>

"He doesn't need healing. This body needs to die once."

<b>

When I turned my head sharply in the direction of the voice, there stood a girl in a long, flowing kimono.

Though I had never seen her before, that overwhelming presence— the torrent of power coursing through her body was undoubtedly that of the Creator God of Earth— Lady Idea.

Her appearance seemed to match that of Rokudo Shuui.

<b>

"Why are you here? What is going on?"

<b>

Normally, we gods only meet in the divine realm.

It is almost impossible for a god to manifest in another world. Not only does it require the permission of the god of that world, but it also demands an enormous amount of divine power to manifest in another realm.

<b>

So, it was something that should not normally happen.

<b>

"Well, it was troublesome to call you to the divine realm."

<b>

Yet this Creator God did it simply because it was a hassle.

Her power is on a completely different level from mine. She is indeed the goddess who created the "Miracle Star," which serves as the standard for gods when creating worlds.

<b>

"Don't worry, I have SR taken care of on this side."

<b>

"Is he safe? He was injured, right?"

<b>

"Yes, all his wounds have been treated. Right now, he is talking with me in the other world— Ah, it seems Rokudo Shuui's body has died. I'll take care of the body here."

<b>

As she said this, Lady Idea reached out toward where Rokudo Shuui was. Immediately, his body vanished. Only a pool of blood and the white lotus he had clutched until the end remained.

For a being that was supposed to be half of him, it was a disappointingly anticlimactic end, and it made me sad.

<b>

"Regardless of the body, do you understand that a certain amount of divine power is needed for the transfer of the soul?"

<b>

"Of course."

<b>

For me, "a certain amount" is an understatement. Even if his body hadn't been destroyed by Venom, my divine power would quickly run out if I summoned a few people.

<b>

"I will summon him using my power."

<b>

I understood what Lady Idea meant. She was suggesting to summon the soul of SR-kun, who had swapped places with Rokudo Shuui and moved to the Earth side.

While I needed to hear his opinion, there was no way SR-kun would not want to be reborn in this world. Anyone could see that from his past actions.

<b>

"Indeed. Both souls wish to live in this world."

<b>

Lady Idea nodded, affirming my thoughts.

<b>

Then, after letting out a breath, she suddenly changed the atmosphere around her.

She crossed her arms and raised the corners of her mouth. A piercing gaze was directed at my eyes.

<b>

"Do you think I haven't noticed anything? Do you really think I would throw my child into a world without salvation?"

<b>

Suddenly, she began to talk about such things.

Seeing me frozen in place, Lady Idea chuckled softly.

<b>

"In this world modeled after a VR game— and making the inhabitants grow attached, you used Rokudo Shuui's heart to have him kill Venom. It was a very reasonable approach."

<b>

"…So you noticed after all. I apologize."

<b>

"Don't worry about it. I've already taken measures."

<b>

"Measures...? What do you mean?"

<b>

As I tilted my head, Lady Idea nodded in agreement.

<b>

"To begin with, do you think I allowed Rokudo Shuui's soul to be transferred out of pure goodwill? That I permitted his reincarnation into another world just because I wanted to fulfill my child's wishes?"

<b>

"…………"

<b>

I had thought that was the case, but it seems I was mistaken. I fell silent without answering.

<b>

"You seemed to think you were manipulating Rokudo Shuui, but that is not the case. From the very beginning— from the moment you proposed a contract to me, everything has been in my hands. It was you who was being manipulated."

<b>

"…I'm sorry, I don't understand your words, Lady Idea. What do you mean?"

<b>

"It's simple. I was merely doing what you did."

<b>

If I were to describe Lady Idea's expression now in words, it would be the smile of a victor.

<b>

And I, who was completely bewildered and stunned, was undoubtedly the loser. Since I hadn't even realized that a battle was taking place, there was no way I could win.

From the start, there was no chance against this overwhelmingly powerful Creator God, and I couldn't even entertain the foolish thought of winning.

<b>

"You harbor feelings of guilt towards Rokudo Shuui. You want to help him, the victim. You were saved by him, and just a moment ago, you were saved from your own crisis. You must be harboring feelings close to love for him, no?"

<b>

Receiving those words from Lady Idea, I stared back at her without affirming or denying. In my mind, I was desperately searching for the connection of her words— where her intentions lay.

<b>

"Now that the continuation of the world is possible, if there is an option to save Rokudo Shuui, you would have no choice but to choose it. Even if it meant exhausting all your divine power and falling to the level of a human."

<b>

What Lady Idea spoke was precisely the same as the tactic I had used on SR-kun.

To foster attachment and use it to fulfill one's desires. However, I still did not know how to save him or what Lady Idea truly wanted.

<b>

"Is there really such a method—? How exactly?"

<b>

Divine power was irrelevant.

No, it wasn't that it didn't matter, but right now, SR-kun was far more important to me.

I wished to be of help to him— I genuinely wished for it from the bottom of my heart.

<b>

"I will summon seven others, different from the Rokudo Shuui I have on this side, to your world. For the Rokudo Shuui who doesn't want to stand out, it will create the best environment."

<b>

At least for a hundred years, I will manage this world and receive divine power— Lady Idea added that, laughing with great delight.
