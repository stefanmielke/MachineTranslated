# A-125 Exploration Begins

<b>

<b>

The internal information of the new dungeon is only provided to those who have cleared an S-rank dungeon. In other words, it's not just us— the Vinzett siblings from the Rezel Kingdom, and Neska and Niz from the Palmur Kingdom can also enter this dungeon.

<b>

However, since they are still not at the required status, it might be too early for them to challenge this dungeon. But since they know that there’s no problem even if they die, it might be good for them in terms of studying rather than leveling up.

<b>

It seems that this new dungeon has appeared not only in Lindale but also in other countries. However, while it has appeared, they cannot enter due to the protective barrier.

<b>

It seems that only the Vinzett siblings have entered the dungeon, but they reportedly encountered monsters and fled. This means that it is understood in the Rezel Kingdom that it is a place that can only be entered by those who have cleared an S-rank dungeon. Well, even without that, since it is a newly appeared dungeon, every country must have sensed that it would be something more intense.

<b>

If dungeons have appeared in other places, I would like to go see them, but since I don't really understand what is currently in Lindale, I should first properly grasp this new dungeon. As for the dungeons in other countries, I’m afraid I’ll have to put them on the back burner.

<b>

"We'll level up on our own, so you big brothers should expand your activity range. It's already guaranteed that it's okay to die, just in case."

<b>

Today, Noah has also come to the dungeon. This means she has finished the death penalty of "not being able to enter for twenty-four hours if you die in the new dungeon."

<b>

Why, you ask? Because yesterday was spent all day with lectures and explanations. I’m sorry about that.

The ones who have come are Crescent, Jade, and a total of seven people including me from ASR.

And as Noah just suggested, today we will split into the Earth group and the other world group to explore the new dungeon.

<b>

It feels a bit lonely to explore separately from Sera and the others, but they seem to be positive about leveling up, and if I were there, I would end up defeating everything anyway. After all, if I leave it to Sera and the others, it will take some time.

<b>

"Well then, shall we go while making a rough map? For now, I want to clarify the relationship between the starting point and that area where a lot of houses are built."

<b>

"How about building something like a signboard? The presence of houses means it's not an instant dungeon."

<b>

"Ah, that's true."

<b>

While heading in the direction where we found the houses last time we entered the dungeon, we have such a conversation.

<b>

The dungeons in this world have all been in the form of instant dungeons, as Crescent said. This means that the internal information resets every time you enter. For example, if you dropped something in a dungeon, it would be gone the next time you came.

<b>

However, in this new dungeon, it has become possible to purchase houses, clearly indicating that it is not that type of dungeon. So, as Crescent said, setting up signboards does seem to be an effective measure, but

<b>

"But won't they be destroyed by monsters?"

<b>

"That's true."

<b>

Crescent and I nodded at Jade's words and sighed.

<b>

However, it’s possible that the area around the entrance is a safety zone where monsters find it difficult to approach or cannot enter, so setting up signboards nearby might still be effective. Currently, there are few landmarks, so it could be convenient.

<b>

In fact, I was just about to get confused, thinking, "Which way was the house again?"

It wouldn’t be surprising to get lost in a dungeon where emergency returns are not possible.

<b>

"Well, let's leave that for next time... For now, I want to defeat monsters, collect coins, and try buying a house."

<b>

After all, I’m curious about what the interior looks like, and I don’t think it would be a cold joke to say there’s no interior.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Esuar went that way~. Good luck!"

<b>

"Okay. Then Jade, I'll draw the aggro this way, so please hit it from behind."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

It's quite leisurely. After confirming the location of the house, we were hunting in the surrounding area, but Crescent and Jade's skills are top-notch, so there’s nothing to worry about.

<b>

We have defeated several monsters so far, but none of them seemed to be boss-level, and we haven't dropped a single coin yet. There might be a chance of a probability drop, but they didn’t feel boss-like in terms of strength.

<b>

If I had to say, this Cyclops we are fighting now seems to have the strength equivalent to an S-rank dungeon boss, but shrunk down to about five meters and increased in speed and power.

<b>

Since everyone here is a member who won’t make mistakes that would lead to direct hits, this judgment is based on the weight of guarding and deflecting.

<b>

For now, it’s certain that it has a lot of health. Quite tenacious.

I face the monster head-on while Jade attacks from behind. Just as Crescent joins the fray, the monster leaps sideways and tries to escape.

<b>

"I won’t let you get away."

<b>

I immediately activated Binding Arrow. The arrows rain down from the sky onto the enemy, and their trajectory becomes thorny vines that bind the enemy. Since Crescent and Jade are keeping the enemy at bay, I didn’t have to worry about missing.

<b>

After a fierce attack from the three of us, the enemy disappeared—coins appeared.

That’s the second one...! I want to collect three more by all means today.
