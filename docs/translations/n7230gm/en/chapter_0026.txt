# 25 Return, and

<b>

<b>

<b>

Having defeated the boss of the B-rank dungeon, the Cyclops, I did not collapse on the spot from the overwhelming fatigue.

<b>

Instead, I was suffering from the pain in my left arm, which was likely fractured, and the pain in my side that I hadn’t noticed due to the adrenaline.

<b>

I wanted to start treatment with a potion as soon as possible, but in front of me was the usual pale blue window.

There was a 30-second countdown timer and the drop items from layers 1 to 5――and the word Elixir.

<b>

"There's no way I can wait 30 seconds. …Let’s hurry back."

<b>

I could hear footsteps rushing towards me from behind, but I ignored them. I was the injured one here, and I wanted to get out of the dungeon quickly and focus on treatment. It would be a hassle if I got forcibly returned while healing.

<b>

I exhaled deeply, as if to release the fatigue built up in my body, and touched the 'Return' option under the countdown timer.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

When I exited the dungeon, it was pitch dark outside.

Of course, it was still before dawn.

<b>

Usually, when I return from the dungeon, the reception area is dark, but for some reason, the lights were on today. Could it be that the B-rank dungeon is special? I wouldn’t know since it was my first time here.

<b>

"SR! Show me your arm right now!"

<b>

When I turned to the voice, I saw Sera standing there with a stern expression. As soon as I turned, she poured some liquid on my arm.

I couldn't tell if it was a mid-level or high-level potion, but it was probably a potion. I mean, Sera was likely injured too.

<b>

Just as I was about to say, "You should rest too, Sera," she grabbed my left arm with both hands and applied pressure.

<b>

"Ow, ow, ow, that hurts."

<b>

"Just bear with it; this way the potion's effect will be stronger."

<b>

"I-I see."

<b>

So that’s how it is. Huh, wow. It really hurts.

<b>

I thought that once I sprinkled the potion, the broken bone would just go back into place on its own, but it seems it’s better to align it properly. I had assumed that in a fantasy world, it would just fix itself. It’s not all-powerful after all.

<b>

"Just leave it like that――Heal!"

<b>

Suzu placed her hand over my arm and cast a healing spell.

A soft, gentle light enveloped my arm along with Sera's hand. It felt slightly warm. Sera's hand was warm too, but this warmth was like that of a halogen heater. Of course, it wasn't that hot.

<b>

By the way, while my side was hard to see at a glance, my left arm was covered in blood.

The potion was dripping onto the ground along with clotted blood. Thanks to that, Sera's hand got dirty too. I felt bad about it.

<b>

"Thank you, Sera, Suzu. I’m sorry, but could you also take care of my stomach area?"

<b>

As I said that and lifted my shirt, they immediately began to treat me. While they were doing that, I took a mid-level potion from my inventory and drank it.

<b>

Ah, the pain is easing. It was a good decision to boost Suzu's INT.

<b>

"Honestly... you’re being reckless. When you got blown away, I thought my heart had stopped."

<b>

"Ahaha. I’m fine with that much. If it had been a leg instead of an axe, it would have been a different story."

<b>

I wouldn’t say I was on the verge of death even with bare hands. After all, I had just defeated it, and I wanted to look cool until the end.

<b>

"I felt like my heart was about to stop multiple times. SR's dodging is not something you can watch calmly."

<b>

Suzu, with a slightly sulky atmosphere and her lips pouted, said that.

<b>

"I was dodging pretty close to the edge."

<b>

"Close to the edge is an understatement. From a distance, it looked like you were almost hit!"

<b>

"Ahahaha. I’m really sorry about that."

<b>

Suzu muttered with a sulky expression, "Do you really mean that?" before casting another Heal on my arm.

<b>

"Shin. You have the Elixir in your inventory, right?"

<b>

I called out to Shin, who was standing there frozen on the other side of the girls treating me. However, he didn’t respond immediately to my words and only reacted when Laika shouted "Shin!" in his ear.

<b>

"Ah, yeah. Sorry. I still can’t believe it――we actually cleared the B-rank dungeon."

<b>

"Most of it was thanks to him. There’s no way we could have done it alone."

<b>

Laika said with a self-deprecating tone.

But that’s a bit off.

<b>

"You said it was thanks to me, but it would have been impossible without the Thunderbolt's Trail and Sera. So this victory belongs to everyone――now, Shin, could you check the Elixir?"

<b>

It seemed my earlier words hadn’t gotten through, so I repeated myself.

<b>

When entering a dungeon as a party, only one person inserts their license card into a special stone pillar. The drops are collected for the explorer who inserted their license card into the recess. This time, Shin was the one who did that.

<b>

Upon hearing my words, Shin began checking the item list in his inventory from the status window.

<b>

"……Found it. No way, it’s really an Elixir…"

<b>

He stared wide-eyed at the window.

Next to him, Laika was also peering into the window, while Sera and Suzu, even while treating me, seemed restless to take a look.

<b>

I understood their feelings of surprise and sentimentality, but the princess must be suffering in the meantime. It would be best to deliver the Elixir quickly.

<b>

By the way, I wonder if it’s okay to go to the royal castle at this time? It’s an emergency, so it should be fine, right?

<b>

As I was thinking that, a familiar deep voice called out, "Hey!" from the direction of the reception area.

<b>

"Did you guys really do it?"

<b>

When I turned my face, I saw a round bald head reflecting the moonlight――Regulus was there. Behind him were Dino and three soldiers.

<b>

I could understand Regulus being there, but Dino was completely unexpected. I instinctively straightened my posture.

<b>

"Yes. The Elixir is with Shin."

<b>

As I said that, Regulus, Dino, and even the soldiers raised their voices in joy, ignoring the time of day.

I was glad it wasn’t in the middle of the city. If this had been an F-rank dungeon adjacent to the royal capital, it would have caused a disturbance.

<b>

Among them, the soldiers A, B, and C were especially exuberant. They hugged each other and cried loudly, expressing their joy with their whole bodies as if they might run out of breath. The princess is quite popular.

<b>

After a while of celebration, Dino opened his mouth.

<b>

"You’ve done well, SR, Sera Bernot, and Thunderbolt's Trail. I’m sorry to bother you while you’re tired, but I need you to come to the royal castle right away."

<b>

I received praise from Dino.

In times like this, should I kneel and say, "Thank you for this great honor!"?――I didn’t have time to think about that, as Dino turned and began giving instructions to the soldiers.

<b>

"The carriage is parked nearby. Let’s head there immediately. I’m worried about the princess."

<b>

Dino said that to all of us. When I asked if such a large number could fit in the carriage, it seemed that the soldiers would be running alongside it.

They weren’t wearing heavy armor, and the distance wasn’t too far. Good luck, soldiers.

<b>

Thus, we were taken to the royal castle without any further ado.
