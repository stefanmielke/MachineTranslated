# 1 Death Sentence?

<b>

<b>

<b>

I, who had spilled filth in front of His Majesty the King, left the scene with the help of two soldiers.

<b>

I have no memory of the path I took.

The only thing I remember is that the metal armor felt cold and pleasant against my cheek.

<b>

And I was lying on a bed somewhere in what seemed to be a guest room within the royal castle.

<b>

As I lay there, I turned my face to the side and saw a bell that looked like it was made of gold and a glass filled with water on the side table. I sat up, took a sip of water, and swallowed it down.

<b>

“――Huh”

<b>

A lady in a maid outfit had said, “If you need anything, please ring this bell. I will come right away.”

Even in my hazy consciousness, I remember her words verbatim.

I think the guards also said something like, “Take your time and rest~,” but I don’t remember much.

<b>

Display the menu window.

<b>

Looking at it again, I’m not even sure if I can call it a “menu” anymore. There are too few items. There’s only status, inventory, and a clock function.

<b>

“Sure enough, there’s no logout option… Did I really reincarnate into a game world?”

<b>

What a mess.

<b>

After choosing the option for reincarnation, it stated that “you cannot return to the original world,” so I probably can never set foot on Earth again.

<b>

“Damn it! There’s still so much left undone in that world――”

<b>

Unfinished business and regrets――――?

<b>

“……Now that I think about it, I was escaping from reality and drowning in games.”

<b>

I have no parents or siblings. I didn’t even have a spouse or girlfriend.

I had people I could call friends in the game, but I had never met them in real life.

<b>

So, if I ended up in the very world I was escaping to, isn’t that a stroke of luck?

<b>

Weighing the pros and cons. I sorted them out one by one in my mind. Of course, even if I sorted them out, it wouldn’t change the current situation, but mood is important, right?

<b>

“Yeah. The more I think about it, the more it seems like a good thing.”

<b>

The fact that my levels and possessions disappeared doesn’t matter to me anymore.

The only problem is that the place I’m currently lying in is like the Imperial Palace in Japan. How did it come to this?

<b>

“Did I really vomit in front of the Emperor and the Prime Minister…?”

<b>

Oh no, I’m feeling nauseous again. This situation is too much for a NEET.

To flush away the rising anxiety, I gulped down the remaining water in the glass.

<b>

To distract myself, I decided to bring up the window and look at my status.

<b>

<b>

☆Status☆

<b>

Name: SR

Age: 18

Occupation: Unselected

Level: 1

Skills: ――

<b>

<b>

“The STR and other labels are gone.”

<b>

I have a rough idea of the growth rates from leveling up, so that’s fine. If the growth rates differ from the game, I’d be at a loss. Still――,

<b>

“It’s been about ten years since I’ve seen ‘Occupation: Unselected’…”

<b>

Back then, I was inexperienced in fighting monsters and often died even in E-rank dungeons. Nostalgic.

<b>

My name is SR, and that remains the same. Additionally, an age category has been added that wasn’t displayed in the game. It seems I’ve rejuvenated by fifteen years. I’m too happy.

<b>

As I was calming my mind while looking at the status screen, I heard a light knock on the door.

<b>

Startled, I quickly swung my legs off the bed. I straightened my back and replied with a nervous voice, “C-Come in!” feeling embarrassed even as I said it.

<b>

“Excuse me. How are you feeling? Brave One.”

<b>

The beautiful maid I saw earlier quietly opened the door and entered with graceful movements. She wore a black and white maid outfit, similar to those seen in Japanese streets.

With bobbed black hair, she looked to be in her mid-twenties.

<b>

By the way, what does “Brave One” mean?

<b>

“Thanks to you, I feel a bit calmer now. By the way, what do you mean by ‘Brave One’?”

<b>

“A Brave One is a Brave One. If you don’t like it, would it be better to call you by your name?”

<b>

“Please do that if possible. My name is SR. Besides, I’m not a Brave One…”

<b>

When I said that, the maid covered her mouth and giggled adorably. I almost fell for her.

<b>

“My name is Shiri. You’re quite the jokester, aren’t you, SR-sama?”

<b>

“No, I’m not joking…”

<b>

I scratched my cheek with my finger, unable to even manage a wry smile.

<b>

“It should say ‘Brave One’ in the occupation field. That’s the best proof.”

<b>

Shiri said confidently.

It would be quicker to actually show her.

<b>

“……Would you like to see the occupation field?”

<b>

“Is that alright?”

<b>

“Yes, it’s not like anything will be lost.”

<b>

As I said this and brought up the window, the maid walked over to me with a smile.

<b>

She placed her hands on her knees and leaned down to peek at the screen. The distance was very close.

A faint sweet scent tickled my nostrils, and I instinctively straightened my posture.

<b>

“――Huh?”

<b>

The maid’s expression froze in an instant as she looked at the status screen, and she turned pale.

<b>

“No way, Occupation――Unselected…?”

<b>

“I told you, I’m not a Brave One! ‘I’m not a Brave One!’”

<b>

Where did the quiet atmosphere from earlier go? She left the room in a fluster, her face ashen.

I could hear her footsteps retreating in a hurry from the other side of the door.

<b>

Left alone in the room.

<b>

“Eh? What? Do they think I’m a Brave One?”

<b>

No, no. I’m just a NEET.

In my original world, I was a virgin known as a wizard, but I’m not a Brave One.

<b>

“Is this a bad situation?”

<b>

I once read a light novel with a similar situation.

<b>

If I remember correctly, the protagonist was summoned to another world but was mistaken for useless and exiled. Or they ended up hiding and running away.

<b>

That protagonist was supposed to have hidden abilities or received cheat powers from a god. I recall them getting revenge or having a satisfying conclusion.

<b>

But I didn’t go through the divine realm at all, did I?

I don’t have any amazing abilities like in a hack-and-slash game, do I?

<b>

“Sure, I might have been strong in the game, but…”

<b>

I opened and closed my hands.

It’s definitely different from the game. It feels real.

If I get injured, I’ll obviously feel the corresponding pain, and the sensation of holding a sword or kicking a monster is surely different from what it was in the game.

No matter how much the game settings tried to make it as close to reality as possible, there must still be differences.

<b>

“……There’s no point in thinking about it. They probably won’t execute me immediately…”

<b>

I’m not confident, though.

<b>

……………………。

<b>

………………。

<b>

…………。

<b>

By the way, it’s taking a while.

It’s already been over thirty minutes since the maid left. Are they having an emergency meeting? If so, the topic is probably about my treatment.

<b>

I directed my gaze toward the window.

<b>

Escaping seems impossible.

Looking out the window, it seems my room is about three stories up. Even if I jumped and survived, my legs would surely be a mess, and I’d have to crawl away. I’d definitely get caught.

<b>

“Should I go out the door and escape――?”

<b>

I swallowed hard.

I tried to imagine an escape route in my head and remembered that I had no grasp of the layout of the royal castle.

Even if I tried to resist the soldiers, I wasn’t wearing any good equipment; I was just in the linen clothes and leather vest typical for beginners. Not to mention, I’m level one.

<b>

“……I’ll sleep. They say good fortune comes to those who wait. It might be a bad dream anyway.”

<b>

When I wake up, I hope I’m back on Earth or that the situation has improved.

<b>

Praying so, I slipped under the covers.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

About three hours later.

<b>

“No way I can sleep in this situation.”

<b>

If there’s someone who can sleep, they must have nerves of steel.

<b>

As I was tossing and turning in bed, I noticed that the view outside the window was dyed orange.

<b>

I let out another sigh, one of many I had lost count of.

<b>

I got out of bed and decided to walk around the room. The sound of my footsteps echoed softly.

I can’t calm down. I tried doing squats. It just made me unnecessarily tired.

<b>

For now, I want to talk to someone.

I haven’t felt the urge to urinate yet, but should I pretend to go to the bathroom and ring the bell?

<b>

Just as I thought that and reached for the bell, I heard a knock on the door.

<b>

Startled, I shivered, but I was calmer than before. After a brief pause, I replied clearly, “Come in.” I can do this.

<b>

“I apologize for the wait, SR-sama. If you’re feeling well, I will guide you to His Majesty.”

<b>

If this had been the first knock, it would have seemed like a very polite way to address me.

However, to me now, those words felt like a death sentence.
