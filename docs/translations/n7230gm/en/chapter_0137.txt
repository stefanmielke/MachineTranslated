# A-23 Shall We Get Started Soon?

<b>

<b>

<b>

When we arrived at the F-rank dungeon, Arnold and Jill were having a conversation, looking bored with their arms crossed in an open space next to the reception.

The beginners heading towards the F-rank dungeon were glancing at them from a distance, as if an invisible barrier was preventing them from approaching the two, who exuded an unusual aura.

I don't know if it's because of the strong aura of a powerful person or simply because of their noble-like attire.

<b>

Noticing us approaching, the explorers looked startled, and Arnold waved at us with a smile. Jill seemed a bit dissatisfied.

<b>

"Good morning! Sorry for being early!"

<b>

"You’re late, late! Five minutes late!"

<b>

Seeing the contrasting reactions of the two, I couldn't help but wonder if they were really siblings. No, is it because they are siblings that they are so different? It's a difficult question for an only child.

<b>

The three of us casually apologized without much remorse. Come on, give us a break for five minutes. It was unavoidable.

<b>

"However—Shin and Esuar really got along well, huh? I heard about it, but seeing it in person feels refreshing."

<b>

"They're both in the top one or two parties in the same country, and neither of them is thinking about kicking the other down. From my perspective, it's weirder to see you two talking with Esuar."

<b>

"Well, there are various things going on—oh, Shin! If you have time, how about we have a match?"

<b>

"Ah... if I have time—no, if I have the energy left, that is."

<b>

Shin replied with a wry smile, and it seemed Arnold was satisfied with that, cheerfully responding, "Then let's do it!"

<b>

As for Jill, who didn't look like Arnold's sister at all,

<b>

"Which one of you is first and which one is second?"

<b>

She pulled up Shin's earlier statement and asked in an interrogative tone.

It was probably to verify the truth of my statement from yesterday. But there are still people around, so...

<b>

"Let's go inside for now. Our conversation isn't something we can share with just anyone."

<b>

Saying that, Noah shifted her gaze to deter the surrounding explorers and tugged at the hem of my clothes, saying, "Come on, let's go."

Her mental age is quite busy, being both mature and childish at times.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

First, let's split up and defeat the slimes.

<b>

That was the plan, but Arnold and Jill offered to take care of them as a warm-up, so we, the Lindell Kingdom group, are taking it easy.

<b>

That said, this is the first floor of an F-rank dungeon.

The number of enemies and the size of the dungeon aren't significant, so it will probably be over in less than three minutes.

I won't even have time to make instant noodles. Well, to begin with, there are no instant noodles in this world anyway.

<b>

According to Arnold, it's better to leave the last one alive in a spot that won't interfere with the match.

<b>

That way, the countdown timer won't start until a stray shot hits the slime. So, it seems the plan is to be able to fight for a longer time.

<b>

"Ignorance is scary... They think three minutes is a good result. You don't plan on holding back, do you?"

<b>

"I won't. Even though I have elixirs, I won't use attacks that could cause fatal damage. I'll go with the Sword Saint profession."

<b>

"...Huh? You're not going with the Overlord?"

<b>

"I can't just unleash skills in front of those two who know nothing... This profession is a closely guarded secret, you know? So, I'm going with Sword Saint. If we're not using skills, this profession is the best for a straight-up fight."

<b>

"I see... That makes sense."

<b>

Hearing my words, Shin nodded as if he understood.

I've already explained the status to them, so if they have properly remembered it, they should have my status in mind.

<b>

☆Status☆

<b>

Name: Esuar

Age: 20

Profession: Sword Saint

Level: 91

STR: SS

VIT: SSS

AGI: SS

DEX: S

INT: SS

MND: SS

Skills: Presence Detection, Double Slash, Anticipation, Intimidation, Sky Sword, Adversity, Swift Feet, Defense Penetration, Phantom Sword, Destruction Sword

<b>

<b>

Compared to the Overlord with all stats at S, it's clear that the Sword Saint has the advantage in a fight without skills.

Most of the useful skills for close combat are gathered in the Sword Saint, and if you're not using skills, having high INT doesn't mean much.

<b>

—That said, thanks to the player bonus, my magical stats are unnecessarily high, even though I'm a physical class.

<b>

"Shin, do you want to warm up too? I can be your opponent."

<b>

"…Yeah. Esuar seems serious, and if I'm not careful, I might end up in the afterlife."

<b>

"I won't mess up like that."

<b>

"Just kidding—I know that much. So, Noah, I'll rely on you with the sword."

<b>

"Understood. You should warm up lightly too, or you might get caught off guard."

<b>

"Like cramping up."

<b>

With a charming smile, Shin moved a little away from me with Noah and began to spar.

Reacting to the sound of metal clashing echoing in the dungeon, the Vinzet siblings stopped their extermination efforts and watched the two warm up intently.

Hey, there are still four slimes left! Aren't you supposed to leave just one?

<b>

"Well, whatever. I should at least warm up while I can."

<b>

Keeping an eye on Noah and the others, I meticulously loosened my body—starting with my legs, arms, and waist—while imagining how I would fight.

I could attack first, but that wouldn't be showcasing my true abilities... I really want to finish them off with a counter. It's simply a matter of preference.

<b>

To be honest, I want to unleash all my skills as the Overlord and go "Woohoo!"

After all, with a profession that is perfect for showing off, I want to flaunt it to everyone.

<b>

"I've given up on that, though."

<b>

After all, this is not a game where you can reset; it's a reality where you can't continue once you die.

<b>

"I hope they get fired up after getting completely beaten once."

<b>

To continue exploring the dungeon, to show that they can make it this far—

That the peak isn't a place that can be reached so easily—

That if they continue to live lazy days, they won't catch up at all—

<b>

I hope they have the spirit to level up enough to come and take my Overlord title.

<b>

I want them to do their best without dying.

<b>

And like Shin and the others from the Thunderous Trail, I want them to believe that there is still a higher level to reach and aim for it.

<b>

That seems like a story for a little while longer, though.

<b>

<b>

As Shin and Noah's bodies warmed up, I took out my bow from my inventory and got into position. I steadied my breathing and sharpened my senses.

<b>

After making slight adjustments to my stance, I waited for a few seconds—

<b>

"Here we go."

<b>

When three slimes lined up in a straight line, I released the arrow. With a thud-thud-thud sound, the arrows pierced through the centers of the slimes.

<b>

The slimes vanished into particles without a fight, gathering the gazes of the other four. And those gazes smoothly shifted towards me.

<b>

"Shall we get started soon?"

<b>

I called out to the four briefly.

<b>

Now, with all your might, come at me and try to defeat me.

And engrave the power of the peak into your eyes.
