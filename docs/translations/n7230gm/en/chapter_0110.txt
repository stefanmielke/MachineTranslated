# 107 Carelessness

<b>

<b>

A gaping hole in my abdomen.

The heat I thought was a stimulus turned into pain, and my thought process rapidly declined.

<b>

Surely, if this had been a battle fought alone, I would have reached game over here without even properly using an elixir.

I wouldn't have been able to save the world, nor reunite with Sera and the others, and I would have never regained consciousness.

<b>

However, at this moment, there was certainly me and Venom here—along with someone else. Though I’m not sure if I can even call it "someone."

<b>

As I collapsed to my knees, coughing up blood, liquid splashed onto my head.

<b>

"Get ready immediately! I'll buy you ten seconds!!"

<b>

Telling someone with a hole in their abdomen to "manage in ten seconds"… what a cruel god this is.

<b>

"…Understood."

<b>

I spat the blood in my mouth onto the ground and replied softly.

<b>

Venom, who was in my line of sight, was covered in a barrier similar to the one I had seen before the battle. However, that barrier was swaying and unstable—thin.

It was clear that the ten seconds to restrain Venom was likely being squeezed out with considerable effort.

<b>

The wound on my abdomen was enveloped in light and was being treated, but just in case, I took an elixir from my inventory and poured it down my throat along with the blood pooling in my mouth.

<b>

I don't think there are any areas that won't be sufficiently healed now.

Wiping the blood from my mouth with the sleeve of my clothes, I glared at Venom.

<b>

"…Are you specifying the attack location with coordinates? Or is it like an invisible laser?"

<b>

There was no time to think deeply.

The ten seconds passed in the blink of an eye, and Venom easily broke through the barrier.

Noah's pained voice echoed in my head, but I didn't have the luxury to worry about that. Even if something happened to him, I couldn't do anything.

<b>

What I needed to do was defeat Venom—that's all.

<b>

Quickly, I took out three advanced potions from my inventory and held one between each finger except my thumb.

<b>

"Even though it's my first time seeing this attack, I can't respond at all."

<b>

First, I needed to analyze.

Correctly understanding the enemy's attack is essential to seize victory.

<b>

Confirming that Venom had begun to lower his eyelids again, I sprinted sideways with all my might. As I scattered the liquid from the bottle, I predicted the timing for Venom to open his eyes and jumped diagonally upward.

<b>

Then, the liquid at the spot where I had pushed off to jump suddenly vanished.

I landed while taking out another potion from my inventory. I ran in a circle around Venom again.

<b>

"It would have been much easier if the potion had vanished from the spot where I was when he started closing his eyelids. But I guess it can't be that simple."

<b>

Next, I crawled on the ground to dodge. What I confirmed was whether this attack affected the entire line of sight of Venom or if it was pinpointed.

<b>

Regarding this, it was the latter.

In other words, the new attack range of Venom had roughly the same volume as himself. With this, there were still various things I could do.

<b>

There was quite a gap before this attack activated, and as long as Venom couldn't completely predict my movements, I should be fine. As long as I didn't repeat the same movement twice, it shouldn't be a problem.

<b>

"I need to finish this quickly."

<b>

That said, the options for evasive actions weren't infinite.

<b>

When my options ran out, it would turn into a battle of luck. Could Venom guess my evasive direction? Even if there were a hundred types of evasive actions, if I exhausted them all, I would die with a one percent chance every time Venom attacked.

<b>

So,

<b>

"Attack is the only option!"

<b>

I stomped the ground with force and charged forward.

<b>

Dodging the more than ten fire projectiles shot from Venom just in time, I slipped into his range. With all my might, I swung my white lotus.

<b>

—But,

<b>

"—Damn, seriously?"

<b>

My attack did not deal any damage to Venom.

A glass-like hexagonal barrier appeared with a sound, blocking my attack.

<b>

Fortunately, I was able to destroy that barrier with a single blow, but the momentum of my attack was completely halted. The fact that I could barely destroy it with all my might meant that breaking it with magic would be difficult.

<b>

I distanced myself from Venom and ran again to avoid being targeted.

<b>

If that attack couldn't hit, I had to either perform an unpredictable attack or unleash two consecutive powerful attacks.

If both succeeded, I could fully utilize the effect of "White Radiance" from the white lotus.

<b>

While I was thinking about this, Venom's body began to blur.

Although everything else in my field of vision looked normal, Venom alone appeared to be blurring—meaning this was,

<b>

"An illusion here… how tough."

<b>

The blurring gradually intensified, and soon two distinct figures of Venom formed. One of them was slightly transparent—though it was called an illusion magic, it was essentially a clone.

<b>

The illusionary Venom slowly began to close its eyelids.

As soon as I confirmed that, I changed direction and started running the opposite way.

<b>

Then, suddenly, my body felt heavy.

<b>

"Combining gravity magic with this? I really don't want that!!"

<b>

I changed my running direction again. Just as Venom opened his eyes, pain struck the upper part of my left ear. When I checked the spot where I felt the pain with my hand, it was completely gone. I felt the slimy sensation of a cut remaining on my hand.

<b>

"—Ugh… that hurts…"

<b>

It hurt, but I had no choice but to leave this ear alone for a while. I couldn't use an elixir due to the time limit, and using a potion for such a wound would be pointless.

<b>

Relying on adrenaline, I dashed toward the main body.

As long as that body-slicing magic existed, I couldn't take my eyes off either Venom for even a moment. I needed to confirm the start of their movements; otherwise, my response would be delayed.

<b>

Numerous spells were unleashed from both sides, and occasionally gravity magic was added, but I had experienced this much in the game many times.

<b>

While running, I took out the red sword from my inventory and gripped it with my left hand.

As I got closer and swung the red sword toward Venom—just as I had anticipated, I was repelled without being able to destroy the barrier.

<b>

"How about this!?"

<b>

I narrowly dodged a rock projectile launched from the front and aimed for a spot where the barrier wasn't deployed, swinging the white lotus.

Even if multiple barriers could be deployed, they wouldn't be in time. My attack successfully left a cut on Venom's eyeball.

<b>

Though it had a body made solely of eyeballs, it was clear that Venom was indeed flinching.

This was the decisive moment!

<b>

"Whoaahhh!!"

<b>

Slice, slice, slice, slice, slice—!

<b>

Dodging the enemy's resisting attacks, I swung both arms with all my strength and shouted. If I could just endure this battle, I wouldn't mind if I fell apart afterward. With that mindset, I continued to swing the red and white swords.

<b>

I want to win—I don't want to lose—!

<b>

"End it!"

<b>

Perhaps due to the effect of my body shrinking, Venom seemed a bit more vulnerable than before. The size of the wounds relative to its volume was drastically different from in the game.

<b>

In any case, this was an opportunity I couldn't have wished for.

<b>

"—End it!!"

<b>

The illusionary Venom attempted to cast gravity magic, but I ignored it.

I continued to slash at the main body right in front of me, disregarding the ground that was caving in. I wished for this battle, this pain, and this broken world to end quickly.

<b>

During my attack, I felt my side being gouged, but I gritted my teeth and endured. I couldn't back down now.

<b>

No matter how much my body was damaged, I could no longer retreat. Surely, in this state, I couldn't drag this into a war of attrition.

<b>

Right now, I had to end this battle!!

<b>

"I won't lose!!"

<b>

Whether it was blood from gritting my teeth or from the wound on my side, I didn't know, but the taste of iron spread in my mouth.

As blood flowed from the corner of my mouth, I swung the sword relentlessly like a broken doll.

<b>

<b>

And—.

<b>

<b>

With a rumble, Venom's eyeball rolled onto the ground.

At the same time, the other illusionary figure dissolved into mist and vanished into the air.

<b>

Venom's gaze was misaligned and rolling in an entirely different direction from me. I tried using release magic and gravity magic from a short distance, but it was completely defenseless.

<b>

Slowly, Venom's eyelids began to lower.

<b>

"…Is it over?"

<b>

I murmured, panting heavily, and took an advanced potion from my inventory, sprinkling it on my injured areas and finally pouring some into my stomach.

<b>

Of course, I wasn't letting my guard down.

In the game, it would have vanished the moment it rolled on the ground, but this one still maintained its form.

<b>

"Noah, are you alive?"

<b>

As I asked, keeping my gaze on Venom, Noah appeared before the eyelid-lowered Venom.

Though half of her body had changed color, she had now recovered to about eighty percent. It seemed she had pushed herself quite hard.

<b>

"…I'm fine. If I rest a bit, I think I'll gradually recover."

<b>

"Then just lie down. You'll need all your strength to create a new world anyway, right?"

<b>

"Well, yes. But still, you really are amazing. To defeat a god of destruction while being human."

<b>

With a darkened face, Noah said shyly.

<b>

"Don't say it like I'm not human."

<b>

"Hehe, I'm just complimenting you. You truly are incredible—without a doubt, you are at the pinnacle of this world."

<b>

"Thanks for that."

<b>

It was nice to hear such things.

Though now that I had defeated Venom, there were only Noah and me left in this world.

<b>

As I thought that and looked back at the rolling Venom, I noticed that, very slightly, its eyelids twitched. Venom's body was facing Noah.

<b>

I let my guard down.

<b>

The memory of having fought Venom solo all this time—and the fact that Venom's body was facing a different direction—led me to mistakenly judge that I was in no danger.

Even if Venom was still alive, moving, and about to attack, I had convinced myself that I could protect myself.

<b>

"—What!? Run!!"

<b>

I shouted in panic. Before I knew it, I was kicking off the ground.

<b>

If I had thought calmly, Noah would likely have been able to withstand that attack from Venom. There was even the possibility that, like a hologram, Noah didn't actually have a physical form. After all, she was a god.

Even if that weren't the case, if I had kicked Venom like a soccer ball, I could have managed somehow.

<b>

But in my panic, I had thrown away the white lotus and red sword and chose to push her away. I had unconsciously chosen to save her.

<b>

My outstretched right hand pushed hard against her left shoulder.

As she was blown away, Noah looked at me with wide eyes and a surprised expression.

<b>

Everything around me appeared to be in slow motion.

<b>

I was in a state of not having my feet on the ground, turning my face sideways.

And there, just before Venom opened its eyes fully, was its figure. 

<b>
