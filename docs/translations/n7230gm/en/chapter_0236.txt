# A-119 Encounter with the Earth Dragon

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I tried to injure my arm with the white lotus, no blood came out; instead, something like particles of light floated out from the wound into the air. Apparently, this is a substitute for blood.

<b>

The somewhat complicated aspect of this dungeon is that it mixes the game Tempest with another world. It would be easier if health points were displayed like in a game, but this seems to adhere more to reality.

<b>

The moment this dungeon determines that a player has "died" is likely when they actually die.

Well, I’m not particularly concerned about taking damage, so it doesn’t bother me much.

<b>

“Hey, doesn’t that look like a boss?”

<b>

In my line of sight was a lizard lumbering across the ground—considering its size, it might be about twenty meters long, so it might be better to call it an earth dragon.

<b>

With a gray body, large horn-like structures were neatly aligned along its spine.

<b>

“Nice size, huh? Who’s going to take it on?”

<b>

“I fought earlier, so I’ll pass.”

<b>

“Then it’s rock-paper-scissors with Esuar!”

<b>

Before I could respond with "I’m up for it," Crescent was already asking Sera and the others, “Is there anyone who wants to do it?”

Sera, Shiri, and Fenon shook their heads vigorously, while Noah shrugged and gestured, “Go ahead.”

<b>

“Why is it assumed that we’re fighting solo…? Isn’t this the first time for Esuar and the others to see this enemy? Aren’t you scared?”

<b>

“Well, it looks weaker than Venom, and we have potions and elixirs—right?”

<b>

“Yeah. Plus, there’s the fact that dying isn’t a big deal.”

<b>

Maybe if we got seriously hurt here, a bit of fear might sprout, but I’ve already had Venom make a hole in my stomach in this world.

<b>

I put my all into the rock-paper-scissors, but I lost. I lost in the previous wolf contest too, making it two losses in a row. It’s sad.

<b>

“If you’re that down, it’s going to be hard to do this… Want to switch?”

<b>

“No, rock-paper-scissors is absolute. Just go ahead and do it.”

<b>

“Okay, I got it.”

<b>

Seeing our exchange, Shiri smiled wryly and said, “This feels too casual for dungeon exploration.”

<b>

Crescent took out her beloved crescent-shaped sword from her inventory and ran toward the earth dragon. Upon getting closer, I realized it was not twenty meters but probably thirty meters long. It’s huge.

Its glaring golden eyes had vertically elongated pupils like a cat, emphasizing its carnivorous nature.

<b>

“...Is it a boss? Which one is it?”

<b>

Crescent started by using the Sword Saint skill, Breaking Blade, on the enemy’s leg from a distance, and the enemy was easily wounded. It looked like it had tough scales, but apparently, it couldn’t withstand an attack from Crescent, whose stats were maxed out.

<b>

“GROOOOAAAR!”

<b>

Expressing its anger, the earth dragon swung its tail at Crescent, who was moving quickly in a circular motion. The tip of its tail had something spiky attached, and if that hit, it wouldn’t just be “painful”—it had a weight and speed that suggested much worse.

<b>

The earth dragon breathed fire, shot spikes, and even summoned a massive wall from the ground. However, none of its attacks hit Crescent, and the wall crumbled easily under her kick.

<b>

Even if the opponent were equivalent to an S-rank boss, it seemed like this was the case.

Moreover, I can’t really gauge the enemy’s strength just by watching its attacks. I need to feel the impact.

<b>

From what I could see, the defenses around its neck and heart seemed tough, and attacking those areas didn’t bring the enemy down. So currently, she was targeting its joints and abdomen.

<b>

“Has its color changed a bit?”

<b>

Fenon, who was watching alongside me, asked. Color?

<b>

“...It does seem to be getting a bit reddish, doesn’t it?”

<b>

When I first saw it, its body was gray, but now it seemed to have a slight reddish hue. It looked like the color of iron being heated.

<b>

“Crescent—Is the enemy getting hot?”

<b>

I cupped my hands like a megaphone and shouted toward Crescent, who was in the midst of battle. She quickly replied, “It’s getting pretty warm!”

<b>

It seemed like its movements were also getting a bit faster, so maybe it was entering a second form.

I thought it might be possible—when suddenly, the earth dragon fell. In the end, Crescent defeated the boss-like monster without taking any damage.

<b>

Well, if it was at a level where she struggled, it would probably be quite tough for Sera and the others, so maybe it’s just right.

<b>

“A coin dropped!”

<b>

In the center where the monster’s particles were disappearing, Crescent raised her right hand to the sky and shouted. In her hand was something that looked like a shiny golden medal.

<b>

I’m envious… I want that too! Where’s the next boss?
