# A-56 Future Predictions

By the command of Niz-kun, the soldiers guarding him exit. Since the target of protection is a member of the royal family, they initially had worried expressions, but when Niz-kun added, "Don't worry," they reluctantly left the room.

<b>

After confirming that the door had closed, I immediately summoned the job list window and adjusted my body so that Niz-kun could see it.

<b>

"So, this is my job list."

<b>

In the Tempest era, it wasn't something to boast about, but in this world, I stand out by several heads.

All my third jobs are level 90 or above, and both my second jobs and derived second jobs are all above level 60, with several maxed out.

<b>

Niz-kun blinked repeatedly as he looked at my window, then rubbed his eyes and leaned in closer. He blinked again.

<b>

"……What does this mean?"

<b>

The question that Niz-kun finally managed to squeeze out was filled with doubt.

He directed his gaze from top to bottom at the vertically arranged jobs. Sera and Phenon were watching his astonished expression and laughing joyfully.

<b>

"As you can see."

<b>

"Well, even so… is this realistically possible?"

<b>

"Well, if I try hard enough, I can do it. For now, let's keep my level confidential— and I think an announcement will come from the Lindell Kingdom soon, so look forward to that. This job list is probably worth remembering."

<b>

"I-I understand. For now, I get that you are an existence that deviates from common sense. To an unpleasant degree…"

<b>

Although he said that, the tone of his voice was somewhat restless, and I couldn't tell if he was truly accepting it as reality.

Whether he believes it or not depends on Niz-kun… but well, given time, he should be able to accept it as fact once he calms down.

<b>

Niz-kun didn't pursue this matter deeply; instead, he quietly looked down, resting his chin on his hand as if deep in thought. As for me, there are things I can answer and things I cannot, so I want to leave it at this for today.

<b>

It may seem like I'm dangling bait and leaving it alone, but it will be beneficial for him… and for this country later, so please bear with it.

<b>

"Tomorrow is the A-rank dungeon, right? Should we discuss that as well?"

<b>

I switched topics and said to Niz-kun with a smile.

He seemed to realize that I wasn't going to elaborate, and he gave a wry smile in response.

<b>

After discussing with Niz-kun, we headed straight back to the inn. Considering my life on Earth, it was an unbelievably luxurious place, but I had somehow gotten a bit used to it, leaving me with mixed feelings. If I were to return to my apartment from my previous life, I would probably feel it was terribly cramped.

<b>

And, the roommate remained Noah.

It might be rude to her, having descended to the lower world as a woman, but among the members, she was the one who didn't evoke any lewd feelings in me, which I appreciated. I definitely shouldn't get aroused here.

<b>

"I don't mind at all, though— *glance*"

<b>

"Don't read my mind, don't flirt with a married man, and don't lift your bathrobe!"

<b>

"Ahahaha!"

<b>

Even as I raised my voice in protest, Noah laughed heartily without a care. She's still the same brat, but for some reason, I can't bring myself to hate her. No, it's not like I think, "What nice thighs."

<b>

I let out a sigh as I watched Noah sitting on the bed, swinging her legs.

<b>

"If you keep messing around like that tomorrow, you'll get hurt. It's an A-rank after all."

<b>

Tomorrow morning is travel time, and we plan to dive into the dungeon in the afternoon. Both A-rank and S-rank dungeons take a fair amount of time due to their size and the number of monsters, so we had to schedule them on separate days. Therefore, the morning is relatively relaxed.

<b>

"No problem! After all, I'm a god, you know. It would be a problem if you underestimate me."

<b>

"You're a former god. Right now, you're just filled with knowledge, and there's no difference between you and us, right? If you let your guard down, you'll regret it."

<b>

"Hehe, nothing surpasses knowledge. I think you understand that better than anyone, big brother."

<b>

"…Well, that's true."

<b>

As Noah said, my power worked in this world because I had knowledge.

<b>

Knowledge to become stronger and knowledge to fight. My eyes were special too, so I can't say it was just knowledge. The invisible experience points are undoubtedly the main reason I could reach the top in this world.

<b>

"You should be careful too; if you let your guard down, you might get tripped up, you know? It's not guaranteed that Lady Idea will do nothing— the current administrator is her, after all. There might be new enemies… dungeons could be created, and along with that, new items could appear."

<b>

"Oh! If that happens, it would be fun! I love efficiency through repetition— but new challenges are also enjoyable."

<b>

"Maybe monsters will appear right on the roadside instead of inside the dungeon."

<b>

Noah raised her index finger, looking as if to say, "What do you think of this idea?" with a smirk.

<b>

But that seems a bit much… it would be too tough for anyone other than explorers.

There are stories like that in other games and light novels, but having dragons flying over the city and living in fear would be too much. Even for someone like me who can fight, I wouldn't like it.

<b>

"Hmm… it does sound fun to be in a state where I don't know what kind of monsters I'll encounter, but it would likely raise the death rate in this world dramatically. I don't think they would change the world to such an extent, right? It's not like there's an overpopulation problem."

<b>

"That's true… well, to begin with, there's a good chance that Lady Idea might not do anything at all."

<b>

That's right. This is just a hypothetical scenario.

<b>

But Lady Idea… if you have any intention of making adjustments to the world, please do so in a way that we can enjoy.

<b>

I looked up at the ceiling, thinking such things in my mind.
