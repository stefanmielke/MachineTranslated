# 60 〇King SR

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When you drop a slice of bread on the floor, the buttered side always lands face down.

<b>

It was a certainty that Sera would be downcast after hearing my story. This was a path that could not be avoided no matter what. I'm sorry.

<b>

I encouraged Sera by saying, "It's good that you found out before receiving the title," but she slumped her shoulders, clearly looking dejected. I'm not good at handling women, so I felt sorry for her but decided to leave her be and move on with the conversation.

<b>

"I've informed Fenon as well, so if the topic of giving the title 'Sword Saint' comes up, he will stop it. So, next is Suz."

<b>

Apologizing to Sera in my heart, I turned my gaze to the priestess girl. Although I call her a girl, she is considerably older than me now.

<b>

Perhaps because she was suddenly called by her name, Suz replied nervously, "Y-yes!"

It felt just like attendance being taken at school. Suz looks quite young.

<b>

"What are you laughing at?"

<b>

A voice immediately pointed that out.

Her eyes were more intense than usual, and perhaps because I had just seen the rehabilitation of that explorer, she looked a bit scary.

<b>

"I'm not laughing, I'm not laughing—so, Suz is a priestess, a sage, and a barrier mage. It's fine that you are already a level 80 priestess, but please raise your other classes to level 60 and become a 'Saint.' I think you'll mainly be supporting as before, but you can also use attack magic, so your tactical options will increase dramatically."

<b>

Suz placed her hand on her chin and quietly murmured the title "Saint" that I mentioned, as if savoring it. Then she raised her hand slightly to ask a question.

<b>

"SR said earlier that there are two conditions, right? I understand the level requirement for the designated class, so I want to know the other condition."

<b>

Oh, I hadn't talked about that yet.

I had completely forgotten to mention it while being distracted by Sera.

<b>

"The other one is related to dungeons. You need to clear B-rank dungeons 100 times and A-rank dungeons 50 times. To be honest, if you're leveling up, you'll reach those numbers quickly, so you don't need to worry too much about it."

<b>

Even back in the game, I naturally achieved those numbers without counting.

It seems that those who only fought against weaker opponents struggled quite a bit, but with Thunderbolt's trajectory or Sera, there shouldn't be any problems.

<b>

"That sounds like an enormous number..."

<b>

"If you can clear an A-rank dungeon even once, it's a festival! And you're saying 50 times... you really are something else."

<b>

"That's not something I decided! It's just the rules, so there's nothing I can do about it!"

<b>

If you have complaints, take them up with the Tempest management. Though that's impossible.

<b>

"I feel like we might be getting poisoned by SR if we think we can manage B-rank dungeons..."

<b>

"Hey, don't say we're poisoned!"

<b>

At my shout, Laika stuck out her tongue playfully. There's no way she's reflecting on her actions.

<b>

Regulus, who had been observing silently, joined the conversation with a troubled expression.

<b>

"So, what do you want me to do, SR?"

<b>

"First, I want you to unlock the currently sealed A-rank dungeons. Also, although it's a bit further down the line, I want you to prepare for when S-rank dungeons appear."

<b>

"Regarding the unlocking of dungeons, you guys should have no problem since you've cleared B-rank dungeons. Do you know where this S-rank dungeon is supposed to appear?"

<b>

"Yes, I'll explain that on the map later."

<b>

"…You really know everything, don't you?"

<b>

Regulus shrugged his shoulders in a way that suggested exasperation mixed with surprise.

<b>

<b>

Then I began to speak a bit faster to everyone present, sharing information about the skills they could acquire and specific discussions about which dungeons to avoid.

<b>

Why was I speaking quickly?

<b>

Because talking about dungeons made me want to dive in quickly. Given Sera's current state, it seemed better to go alone today.

<b>

After setting aside time for questions and noticing that no one was speaking anymore, I stood up from the sofa.

<b>

"Well then, let's wrap it up for today. If you have any concerns, feel free to come and ask anytime. I'll be home in the morning and evening."

<b>

Upon hearing my closing words, Thunderbolt's trajectory and Regulus relaxed their bodies and exhaled. It had been more of a discussion or an explanation session, but it seemed to have taken quite a toll on them.

<b>

I patted Sera's shoulder, who still looked like her soul had left her body, and said, "Please lock up." She responded with a mysterious "Huh," but can I interpret that as her understanding?

<b>

I told Shin and the others, "You can take your time until Sera comes out," and stepped away from the sofa.

<b>

"What’s up? Are you going somewhere?"

<b>

"Of course, I'm going to the dungeon. I want to restock on elixirs."

<b>

I had been talking with Fenon and the others until the evening yesterday, so I hadn't been able to spend much time exploring dungeons. Today is still early, and I should be able to make two rounds in the B-rank dungeon.

<b>

"You're something else... You really are strange. There's no one else who would approach a B-rank dungeon with such casualness."

<b>

"Yes, yes. This is what it means to be SR."

<b>

"Just don't overdo it, okay? ...Though it might be useless to say that."

<b>

As I was told this with a mix of exasperation from Thunderbolt's trajectory, I casually laughed, "Hahaha," and distanced myself from them.

My desire for dungeons was about to break through its limits. I want to go quickly. I want to defeat monsters quickly. I want to level up quickly.

<b>

—Just as I was about to leave the living room in a hurry, Sera, who had been sulking, suddenly perked up and called out to me.

<b>

"SR? Where are you going?"

<b>

Had she not been listening to the conversation until now? I'm going to the dungeon!

<b>

"I'm going to the B-rank dungeon. You should take a good rest, you must be tired."

<b>

Mainly from mental fatigue.

<b>

"Yeah, I suppose so. I'll take it easy for today."

<b>

"Yeah, I think that's a good idea."

<b>

...

<b>

............

<b>

...................

<b>

Um... Can I go now? I hesitated to leave the room after stopping for a moment.

<b>

As I waited for Sera to say something, she opened her mouth and said, "By the way..."

<b>

"What class is SR going to become? Are you going to be the same as us— a Sword Saint?"

<b>

Oh, I had forgotten to mention that too.

<b>

"I will of course become a Sword Saint, and I will also become a Saint. It's necessary to acquire bonuses. However, ultimately, I will likely become a magic class."

<b>

Fighting as a third-tier class is somewhat different from the battles relying on previous stats. Unlike first and second-tier classes, third-tier classes have a vastly different amount of skills they can use.

<b>

Excluding the Overlord, the third-tier class at the top of the tree can use skills from the branches of first and second-tier classes, and the new skills they learn are powerful. Battles using those skills will be the norm.

<b>

When I faced the Overlord Venom, I often fought either as the spirit archer that Shiri is expected to become in the future or in this magic class.

<b>

The pinnacle of magic-related classes consisting of sorcerers, heavy knights, and sages— it stands in opposition to the title of 'Hero' and was also the class I used when I defeated the Overlord Venom alone.

<b>

<b>

"I will become the 'Demon King.'"
