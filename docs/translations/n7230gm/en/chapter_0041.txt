# 39 Drag = Margus

<b>

<b>

<b>

The place that Fenon-san brought us to was, as I expected, the mansion of the Duke of Margus. In front of the iron gate, there were two soldiers clad in metal armor. Fenon-san and Shiri-san approached them and began talking about something.

<b>

"It's huge... Has Sera been here before?"

<b>

"No, today is the first time I've come this close. I've met the Duke of Margus at a party, though."

<b>

"Oh, so you know each other."

<b>

"I've only had a brief conversation with him. I don't know if he remembers me."

<b>

"I see. So that's how it is."

<b>

I wonder if it's like the relationship I have with the principal. I don't know.

<b>

While we were having that conversation, one of the soldiers hurriedly opened the gate and ran towards the mansion. It's noisy.

<b>

Thinking that they might have finished their discussion, Sera and I also approached them.

<b>

"Esuar-sama, please wait a moment. Since this was an unannounced visit, it seems they need some time to prepare."

<b>

When Fenon-san noticed me walking over, she smiled and said.

<b>

"That's fine, but are you really okay with this?"

<b>

"Yes. It seems my uncle is home, and I believe we will be negotiating in the reception room."

<b>

--Uncle? Does that mean the Duke of Margus is a relative of His Majesty?

<b>

"Is the Duke of Margus His Majesty's brother?"

<b>

"Yes, he is. The younger brother."

<b>

Hmm.

I don't really understand the structure of the nobility, but he's the brother of the king.

As I imagined in my head whether they might resemble each other in face or atmosphere, the soldier who had gone towards the mansion returned with a black-haired man in his late fifties, dressed in butler attire.

<b>

His hair was slicked back and styled, and just from that, his neat personality was conveyed. It was as if every single hair had been meticulously arranged.

<b>

The man first bowed gracefully to Fenon-san.

<b>

"It has been a while, Fenon-sama. I have heard a bit from my lord, but how is your health?"

<b>

"Yes. Thanks to the elixir, I have no ailments at all."

<b>

"That is wonderful to hear—everyone, I am Lorenz, the head butler of this mansion. Please feel free to ask for anything."

<b>

He probably knows Shiri-san through Fenon-san. After a brief mutual bow, he turned to Sera and me and bowed his head.

<b>

"I am Sera Bernault. I apologize for the sudden visit."

<b>

"I am the explorer Esuar."

<b>

Saying that, I lightly bowed my head.

Then, when I returned my gaze to the butler, he was looking at me with interest.

<b>

"So you are Esuar-sama. The rumors have reached even this place from the royal capital."

<b>

What rumors are those?

Is it about my title? Or has the fact that I came from another world been conveyed from the royal castle? I don't know.

<b>

"It has been since childhood that I last met Sera-sama."

<b>

"Was it? Sorry, I don't remember much."

<b>

"No, no, Sera-sama was still young at that time—ah, excuse me. First, let me guide you to the mansion. This way, please."

<b>

Lorenz-san turned slightly and gestured towards the path to the duke's mansion with his palm.

It was efficient, or rather, sophisticated—so much so that I began to suspect that the previous exchanges were merely time adjustments until preparations were complete.

I admire that kind of demeanor, but if I were told to do it, it would be bothersome.

I don't like being tied down to anything.

<b>

<b>

Even in a maid café, there are fewer maids than this—such a thought crossed my mind as we were greeted by a large number of maids.

<b>

Lorenz-san guided us to the reception room, just as Fenon-san had predicted. When I entered the room and checked the time, it was just before 7 PM.

To intrude during dinner time is quite disrespectful unless you're a princess. Perhaps she intends to have both accommodation and dinner. She has quite a bold personality.

<b>

We sat on the sofa in the reception room, four of us in a row, and enjoyed the coffee and tea brought by the maids for about five minutes—then Lorenz-san returned, accompanied by a man in his forties wearing a cloak primarily in shades of blue.

His luxurious clothing and facial features resembled those of His Majesty—there's no doubt about it. He must be the Duke of Margus.

<b>

His silver hair shone brightly, long enough not to lose to Sera or Fenon-san, and was braided at the nape of his neck. He didn't have the intimidating presence of His Majesty, but with those sharp eyes, even a small child might start crying if glared at.

<b>

As he entered, he gestured for us to remain seated.

<b>

"You may stay seated."

<b>

After saying that, he slowly sat down on the sofa opposite us.

Lorenz-san maintained a rigid posture in front of the door. He stood still, as if he didn't exist in this space, suppressing his presence.

<b>

After Sera, Shiri-san, and I introduced ourselves briefly, the Duke of Margus spoke directly to me without addressing Fenon-san or Sera.

<b>

"You are Esuar, I see. As I heard, you are quite young—I'm Drag Margus, the ruler of this land."

<b>

He leaned forward and extended a delicate hand wrapped in a white glove from within his cloak.

<b>

So there is a handshake culture in this world too—wait, is it really okay to casually shake hands with a duke?

<b>

I glanced at Sera and Fenon-san beside me, but they were grinning for some reason at my flustered state.

Why are they laughing? I don't understand.

<b>

"Thank you for your courtesy... I am the explorer SR."

<b>

Thinking it would be bad to keep Drag-sama waiting, I shook his outstretched right hand in return. His hand felt cold, almost like I was shaking a doll's hand.

Drag-sama awkwardly returned the handshake.

<b>

...It's a long handshake.

<b>

"Um... is there something?"

<b>

While still shaking hands, Drag-sama stared at me intently, for some reason smiling.

<b>

He maintained that smile and gaze on me while leaning back against the back of the sofa. It seemed the handshake was finally over.

<b>

Letting out a sigh of relief, I tried to release my hand. I tried to—?

<b>

...Huh?

<b>

"Whoa!?"

<b>

I inadvertently let out a strange voice.

No, this is strange! Why is only the hand still here!? Drag-sama has already returned to the sofa! You should come back with it!

<b>

In my hand, Drag-sama's hand was still being held. However, that hand was missing its forearm.

<b>

Was the arm of the inhabitants of this world detachable!? I see—wait, that can't be true!

<b>

Just as I completed a mental retort, Drag-sama burst into a loud laugh.

He must have found it quite amusing, as he wiped away the tears that flowed from the corners of his eyes with his fingertips while saying, "Sorry, sorry," without any sign of remorse.

<b>

"Even a hero who has conquered a B-rank dungeon can panic in unexpected situations—it's a prosthetic hand. I lost my forearm in a dungeon long ago."

<b>

As he said this, Drag-sama pulled out his arm from within his cloak.

Just as he mentioned, the arm he offered was curled up midway, missing its forearm.

It seems I have been teased. I might just hit him, old man.

<b>

"You haven't changed, uncle."

<b>

"Yeah. It's a waste not to do this to someone meeting me for the first time."

<b>

So you haven't changed—does that mean you always do this kind of thing?

I’m starting to get an idea of what kind of person he is. He seems to have quite a crazy personality.

<b>

At the same time, I understood what Lightning's Trail and Sera and Fenon-san meant when they said, "Esuar will be fine."

<b>

After all, I have an abundance of elixirs in my inventory that can completely heal not only illnesses but also missing body parts.
