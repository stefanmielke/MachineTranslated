# A-105 Phenon and Shiri

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next day. I decided to go out with Phenon and Shiri.

It seems that Sera, Crescent, Hisui, and Noah are going to the Explorer Guild as a group of four. The two former rankers want to see the explorers while also receiving guidance from Arnold and Jill. Sera and Noah are probably just accompanying them.

<b>

Well, it’s probably a consideration for Phenon and the others, who haven’t had a chance to see the city with me.

<b>

“Hehe, it feels like it’s been a while since I’ve experienced this kind of atmosphere.”

<b>

Looking up at me, Phenon spoke with a cheerful smile.

<b>

“I think we’ve gone out quite a bit in Lindale, though?”

<b>

“In other countries, the title of ‘Princess’ is quite heavy for you, Phenon. In fact, you do have bodyguards with you.”

<b>

As we strolled through the city, the three of us chatted.

With Phenon in the center, I was on the right side, and Shiri was on the left.

There seem to be bodyguards far behind us and on the roofs to the left and right. I don’t think it’s necessary, though. Well, if something were to happen to Phenon here, it would become an international issue, so it can’t be helped.

I’ll try not to think about that and just enjoy myself.

<b>

“Don’t you miss Japan?”

<b>

After leaving the accessory shop, Phenon asked.

I wondered what brought that on suddenly, but it’s true that recently, the topics from my original world have been increasing around me.

<b>

First, Crescent came along. Then Hisui.

And since I’m planning to call my parents to this world in the future, it’s only natural that there would be more discussions about Earth—Japan.

<b>

“Hmm… I think I’ve mentioned this before, but I wasn’t exactly good-looking in my previous world, and I couldn’t really hold down a job, nor did I have any real friends.”

<b>

If I had to say, I wish the food culture and electronic devices were more prevalent in this world. There are no smartphones here, so the only way to communicate is through communication magic tools. And those magic tools themselves are precious, so not everyone can own one.

<b>

“Rather, I think if I were sent back to my original world now, I would miss this world terribly. There are just too many important things here.”

<b>

Sera, Phenon, Shiri, and Noah. Of course, Crescent and the others too.

If I were to return to Earth, I would probably end up missing even Regulus and cry—no, that would be disrespectful to Regulus. My apologies.

<b>

And above all, the dungeons are just too much fun!

<b>

Moreover, as long as I’m fighting in those enjoyable dungeons, I don’t have to worry about my old age at all. Feeling like I’m in a position of advantage is one reason it’s enjoyable, but I originally liked Tempest, so that might not matter much.

<b>

This world needs me— and that makes me really happy.

Even if it’s a world created conveniently, I think that’s perfectly fine.

<b>

“I also care about you, Esar.”

<b>

Hearing my statement, Shiri smiled gently. If Phenon has an angelic smile, then Shiri’s smile could be described as that of a saint. In any case, both of them are cute.

<b>

“Hey, that’s unfair, Shiri! I also care about Esar!”

<b>

“I-I’m sorry, Phenon! I didn’t mean it that way—”

<b>

“Ahaha, you don’t have to worry about it, Shiri.”

<b>

These two are really breaking down the relationship between princess and maid. Of course, in a good way. There was already some atmosphere like that, but it feels even more relaxed now.

It seems that both Phenon and Shiri are trying to get closer. They’re working together in the same party, and… probably, Shiri will end up marrying me just like Phenon.

<b>

But well, this isn’t something I should interfere with, and I think they’ll be fine.

As I absentmindedly watched their interaction, Phenon suddenly turned to me.

<b>

“And! No matter what kind of appearance the past Esar had, I won’t mind!”

<b>

“Y-yes! Even if you weren’t working, I’ll work for you!”

<b>

Hey, hey, Shiri, are you telling me to become a freeloader?

I’d really prefer to avoid that, as it would make it hard for my heart to remain calm. I do think about not wanting to work due to reasons related to human relationships when I think of my job back in Japan… but still, I don’t want to live off someone else’s support.

<b>

Is living off insurance money considered being a freeloader? Such trivial thoughts crossed my mind.

<b>

“Well, in this world, diving into dungeons is like a job, so I don’t think that will happen. I’d probably keep diving even if I didn’t earn any money.”

<b>

“Not ‘like,’ but being an explorer is a proper job.”

<b>

“That means being an explorer is my calling.”

<b>

If I dive into a dungeon for a day, I can earn enough money to last a year. To be honest, I have more than enough money already, but it gives me peace of mind.

<b>

“Hehe, I never imagined I would end up living like this. Thank you, Esar. For coming to this world.”

<b>

“I’d like to thank you again as well.”

<b>

Saying that, the two of them smiled. It was a gentle smile.

<b>

It seems we’re going to a sweets buffet from here. The two of them, who love sweet things, are excited.

Seeing everyone smiling makes me incredibly happy. I’m really glad to have come to this world.
