# A-65 The First Encounter with Magic is Cheating Level

<b>

<b>

The match between the "Crimson Sword," led by Neska, and the four members of ASR, excluding me, was just about to begin. I set my profession to Sword Saint and decided to watch the match, ready to intervene at any moment.

With this, even if something unexpected happens, as long as I splash an Elixir, I shouldn't die for now. There's no guarantee, though.

<b>

I have no information about the opposing party other than that Neska is a martial swordsman. You could say I'm not interested.

On the other hand, our side has Sera as a martial swordsman, Shiri as a magic archer, and Phenon as a sage. Although all of them meet the requirements for a third job change, they chose their second job classes, which have higher stats because they have leveled up beyond level 60, rather than a third job that hasn't leveled up.

<b>

By the way, Noah, whose level exceeds 60 in all professions, including third jobs, is being rather childish... or is it childlike? Well, anyway, she has chosen the Demon Lord profession. It seems she has no intention of holding back.

<b>

"So, why is Niz-kun here too?"

<b>

"I heard it from the soldier who was guarding you."

<b>

Ah... I see. The soldier who was wandering around that inn wasn't guarding the high-class inn but was actually protecting us. I think it's unnecessary, but since Phenon is a princess from another country, they probably had no choice.

<b>

"Do you think ASR's four will win after all?"

<b>

While watching what seemed to be the guild master explaining to both parties, Niz-kun asked.

<b>

"I feel like it's going to be a one-sided victory for Noah. It depends on whether she goes all out or not."

<b>

"Eh...? She's your sister, right? Is she really that strong? I thought she was amazing during the last dungeon exploration, but..."

<b>

Well, she is a former goddess.

Due to that position, Noah knows various ways to fight. And she can incorporate that into her own body. It's my wild guess, but I think she has been thinking about how to teach others in case someone someday defeats Venom. She's a brat, but surprisingly serious.

<b>

"She can't beat me, though!"

<b>

"Why are you competing with your sister—oh, it looks like it's about to start."

<b>

After saying that with a mix of exasperation, Niz-kun pointed towards the training ground.

There, both parties were facing each other at a distance. They were already in a stance, weapons drawn.

<b>

Eventually, with the guild master-like person's shout of "Start," the match began—however.

<b>

"Wow... how unfortunate..."

<b>

On the first move, Noah's gravity magic was activated. It's like a battle against Venom.

Moreover, since the "Crimson Sword" was supposed to be experiencing that technique for the first time, they were understandably confused.

They seemed bewildered by the mysterious situation where their bodies were being drawn to the ground. No matter how they tried to move their bodies, they couldn't move as they wished, and since they didn't know the effective range, they didn't even know where to escape.

It's no wonder they were panicking.

<b>

"That's the Demon Lord's skill, gravity magic. To put it simply, it's a magic that makes your body incredibly heavy. Noah activated it where the 'Crimson Sword' is."

<b>

I explained to Niz-kun, who was watching the match with a blank expression uncharacteristic of a prince.

<b>

"And the magic arrow that just hit the guy in the chest is the magic archer's 'Magic Arrow.' Do you know that?"

<b>

"I think I know this one too, but Phenon's body is glowing red because of 'Body Enhancement.'"

<b>

"And Sera's—oh, it's over."

<b>

I was about to give a brief explanation of the four members of ASR, but it ended quickly due to Sera's sudden attack. The members of the "Crimson Sword" were already collapsed on the ground, and the gravity magic that had been released during Sera's attack was activated again.

<b>

The referee, the guild master (provisional), was looking back and forth between the four members of ASR and the five members of the "Crimson Sword" with a dazed expression, showing no signs of making a judgment on the match. I called out to Niz-kun, "Shall we go?" and we headed towards the place where the match had taken place.

<b>

The members of ASR noticed us approaching and changed their expressions. Sera looked dissatisfied, Shiri had a wry smile, Noah seemed satisfied, and Phenon appeared confused.

<b>

"Um... I just activated magic and it was over..."

<b>

Yeah, Phenon activated body enhancement, but the match ended before she could make an attack. If you have complaints, please direct them to Noah and Sera.

<b>

"I didn't really do much either."

<b>

"I only used gravity magic~"

<b>

"That was unsatisfying..."

<b>

Yeah. I guess they were trying to impress me because I didn't look strong, but now that enthusiasm seems to have vanished. I can't help but feel sorry for the "Crimson Sword."

<b>

Before the match started, I thought about their respective strengths and the difference in stats, but in the end, it felt like the match was decided by a single skill. Just like the Sword Saint's Broken Sword or the Spirit Archer's Binding Arrow, it's indeed difficult to avoid them when encountering them for the first time.

<b>

"You knew this would happen, didn't you?"

<b>

I asked Noah, who was smiling and had her hands clasped behind her head.

At that, Noah finally released the gravity magic and tilted her head, saying, "Well, of course."

<b>

"But as a sister who was made fun of by her brother, I couldn't just stay silent, you know?"

<b>

Noah expressed her opinion in a carefree manner like that.

Could it be that she was actually angry, even though she casually said before the match, "Should I join in too?"

<b>

I don't feel bad about it, but... I still feel a bit sorry for the "Crimson Sword."

I'm sorry, Neska.

<b>

In the match with me that will follow, I'll make sure to make it somewhat enjoyable...
