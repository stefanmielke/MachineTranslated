# A-4 The Idle Pastime of the Overlord

<b>

<b>

<b>

The Trail of Thunder.

<b>

The name of this explorer party, composed of Shin, Suzu, and Laika, has now become well-known both inside and outside the country, regardless of whether one is an explorer or not.

<b>

They obtained an elixir and saved the life of the first princess, Fenon.

Even just this part alone contains enough elements to become famous, but those guys chasing after me would never be satisfied with just this.

<b>

The Trail of Thunder announced that they discovered a new class after conquering a B-rank dungeon with Sera. As a result, they were awarded the title of 'Pioneers' by the kingdom, and in no time, their name echoed throughout the world.

<b>

They then conquered an A-rank dungeon that had never been traversed before—and furthermore, they won the international martial arts tournament held jointly by six countries.

<b>

Their overwhelming momentum, which left others in the dust, was truly like thunder.

<b>

Shin and the others' achievements astonished those around them, and the hope of a 'new class' illuminated the world. The trail they followed will surely become a legend.

<b>

While explorers express them as 'living legends,' I'm sure they themselves still feel unsatisfied.

<b>

To change the subject.

<b>

When they arrived in the royal capital, they were taken directly to the royal castle without even contacting us, and immediately began preparations for the ceremony.

It would take time for the crowd to settle down, and even if they came out into the streets, they would likely be surrounded by people like idols, making it impossible to have a conversation.

<b>

"Famous people have it tough, huh?"

<b>

As I grumbled in complete detachment, an axe was swung down with such force that it could split my body in half.

<b>

"Whoa, focus, focus."

<b>

I rotated my body on my left foot and dodged the attack of the B-rank dungeon boss—the Cyclops—as usual.

I had a painful experience with this guy before. I never want to taste that kind of pain again. My arm was broken badly back then.

<b>

"At this point, it's just bullying the weak, isn't it?"

<b>

"Don't say such things, Noah. It's dangerous if I let my guard down too."

<b>

"I feel like if it were you, big brother, you'd probably fight unconsciously even if you let your guard down."

<b>

"That's not true—I think."

<b>

I couldn't make a definitive statement. There are times when I'm lost in thought even during battle... so it's possible to say that I might be fighting unconsciously.

<b>

<b>

Currently, I am here with Noah at the usual B-rank dungeon where we can obtain elixirs.

I'm not diving in just for the elixirs, nor am I leveling up. It's merely a pastime.

<b>

I wonder if Fenon is now giving a few words of congratulations to Shin and the others.

Although they initially declined to participate in the ceremony, thanks to my persuasion, the two agreed to attend, so I can assume that I won't be scolded later by His Majesty or Count Bernot.

<b>

In exchange, I managed to secure some conditions from the two—no, three—but honestly, they feel more like rewards to me.

<b>

"In Japan, where you lived, big brother, wouldn't someone get stabbed with a knife in that situation?"

<b>

"Don't say such dangerous things..."

<b>

I ducked to dodge the horizontally swung axe while letting out a sigh.

I want to believe it's impossible, but I can't completely rule out that possibility, which is a bit scary.

<b>

<b>

If Fenon participates in the ceremony, her maid, Siri, will naturally accompany her to the royal castle. And since Sera will also attend the ceremony, the only ones left will be me and Noah.

<b>

The city is crowded, so I told the three that we would be diving into a dungeon, and their expressions visibly changed. They looked angry—not so much angry as pouting.

<b>

"Noah is being unfair."

<b>

"I want to go to the dungeon with Esuar too."

<b>

Sera and Fenon voiced their complaints, while Siri pouted her lips.

I understand the two who are supposed to get married, but for some reason, Siri also had a dissatisfied look. I assume she doesn't have any feelings for me and simply wanted to dive into a dungeon.

<b>

Well, that connects to the conditions, and I ended up having dungeon dates with each of them.

It's not at a fancy restaurant but inside a dungeon, which feels very much like me... I wonder if they're okay with this.

<b>

"Inside the dungeon, we can be alone together. Plus, big brother looks really cool when he's fighting."

<b>

Noah, watching my battle from a short distance, sent me a glance and said that.

Being told straight out that I'm 'cool' made me a bit embarrassed, so I replied shortly, "Thanks for that."

<b>

And then――

<b>

"Shall we finish this soon?"

<b>

I muttered in a voice only I could hear, then took out the White Lotus from my inventory and took a big step back from the enemy.

I shaped my empty left hand into a gun with my index finger raised, pointing it towards the sky. My right hand holding the White Lotus was drawn down as if pulling a bowstring.

<b>

"Go."

<b>

In accordance with my will, countless bright green lights were released upwards. They fell toward the Cyclops, swirling like shooting stars.

<b>

This is the skill 'Binding Arrow' of the Spirit Archer, one of the third-tier classes alongside the Demon King. Not only does it bind, but enemies hit by this binding arrow will continuously take damage as if wrapped in thorns.

Since it's an INT-dependent skill, activating it now will deal quite heavy damage.

<b>

I lowered my left hand, which was raised to the heavens, and pointed my palm at the struggling Cyclops.

A few seconds later, with a dull thud, the enemy dropped to all fours as if crushed by something. The axe it had been holding plunged forcefully into the ground.

<b>

This is the familiar skill of the Demon King—Gravity Magic.

While it doesn't have the instantaneous effect of Venom's skills, there's no doubt that it's a very useful skill.

<b>

The Cyclops, completely immobilized by the Binding Arrow and Gravity Magic, won't be able to escape easily, not even as a B-rank dungeon boss.

I swung the White Lotus down diagonally as if to practice, from a spot nearly ten meters away from the enemy.

<b>

My slash aimed at its neck dealt a fatal blow as if I were standing right in front of the enemy, ignoring the distance.

With that critical hit, the Cyclops showed no signs of suffering and simply vanished into particles.

<b>

The pinnacle of physical classes—the skill 'Destruction Sword' of the Sword Saint.

It doesn't impose the unreasonable fact of having cut, but simply closes the distance. However, without a doubt, it is the strongest skill among the Tempest.

<b>

Even from a distance, I can deal damage as if I were in close combat, so if the opponent has a Sword Saint, I must always be on guard. For me, who primarily focuses on close combat, it was a very troublesome opponent.

<b>

"You look like you're having fun."

<b>

As I witnessed the Cyclops' demise, Noah called out to me from behind. When I turned around, she was smiling and looking at me with delight.

<b>

"Yeah. I couldn't fight like this in a game."

<b>

After all, you can't change classes inside a dungeon.

<b>

When I was diving solo, I could only unleash the skills of the Demon King if I was a Demon King, or the skills of the Sword Saint if I was a Sword Saint.

<b>

But now, it's different.

Now that I've obtained the class of Overlord, I'm different.

<b>

"Being able to use the skills of all classes is just too invincible."

<b>

I wonder what would happen if I acquired all the skills of a level 100 third-tier class like the Demon King's 'Master of Magic.'

Please look forward to it... (meaningful)
