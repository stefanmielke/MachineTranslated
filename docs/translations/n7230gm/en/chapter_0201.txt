# A-84 One Gear

<b>

<b>

<b>

After the match with Crescent, I healed her with a high-level potion, and we returned to the party house with the usual members.

<b>

Since His Majesty and the Chancellor—people from the kingdom—know that Crescent is from the same hometown as me, they started to misunderstand that the strength of people from Earth is somehow abnormal. I properly denied that, as I would be troubled if they treated her like a fragile thing. I made it clear that we are the top one and two, and that probably no more residents from my world will come to this one.

<b>

A change of topic.

<b>

Crescent's wounds have healed, and although she did suffer some fractures, she didn't sustain any major injuries like losing an arm. However, she seems to be mentally exhausted, so I told her to rest without pushing herself. I decided to ask Siri, a fellow female, to take care of her.

<b>

So, currently gathered in the living room are Sera, Phenon, and Noah. It seems that the Lightning Trail has been stirred by witnessing a fierce battle and wants to discuss future plans with the party.

<b>

As for us, we were leisurely drinking tea after finishing dinner.

<b>

In times like this, back in my original world, we would probably be talking with the TV on, but there’s none of that in this world. I actually prefer it this way since we can concentrate on the conversation.

<b>

"Earth people really have a lot of amazing talents, huh? I don't feel like I could win against them if we have the same status."

<b>

"If we're talking in terms of experience, then that’s probably true. We might have the advantage in physical strength here, though."

<b>

But in this world, where the concept of levels exists, is that really the case? Physical abilities can increase without doing any muscle training. If status doesn’t mean anything, Earth people might actually be surprisingly strong.

Well, that aside.

<b>

"Since she’ll be with us for a while, can we just add her to our party for now? She has the strength to manage solo, but it must be lonely."

<b>

"There's also the option of leaving her with the Lightning Trail, but she’d probably feel more secure with her brother. I don’t mind."

<b>

Noah agreed first, saying that, and Sera and Phenon nodded along with "Got it" and "Of course." I was relieved that it didn’t get complicated.

I believed that Siri would agree as well, so I started thinking about future plans with Crescent joining ASR.

<b>

However, that’s something.

<b>

The dungeon that I could clear easily by myself has become even easier. Considering Sera and the others' level-ups, it’s clear that splitting into two groups would be better, but that would defeat the purpose of being together.

<b>

I guess I’ll just be glad that I can spar with Crescent during my free time.

I realized that my body had gotten rusty from the previous match, and it would be a win-win for both of us.

<b>

"Let’s take it easy until Crescent gets used to this country—this world—and then we can head to the Rezel Kingdom. Depending on Crescent, I think three months should be good."

<b>

When I suggested that, Sera nodded without hesitation.

<b>

"I don’t mind. I want to level up to catch up with ASR, and I’d like to get along with her too."

<b>

"Right. Let’s hear a lot about ASR from the other world!"

<b>

No, no, no! I’d rather not have that, please!?

Back then, I avoided interactions with people—or rather, I was too focused on getting stronger... Well, I was probably feeling guilty for escaping reality through gaming. I must have been scared of revealing that I was a pathetic person by talking.

<b>

"I understand how you feel, brother, but you mustn't forget that your actions became the catalyst for saving this world, right? No matter how small, no matter how tucked away, there’s no such thing as a useless gear. Even if it seems out of sync, everything is interconnected and moves the world."

<b>

In your case, brother, you’re quite a powerful gear, though—Noah said with a smile.

When I hear that, it somehow makes me sound like an amazing person, but I’m a NEET... Right now, if someone asked me, "What’s your occupation?" I could confidently answer, "I’m an explorer!"

<b>

"I’m just one gear too, this world is one gear, and even Lady Idea is one gear. The way you lived in Tempest, which you felt was an escape, might have unknowingly helped someone."

<b>

"Don’t lift me up like this... I can’t give you anything to make you happy, you know?"

<b>

When suddenly praised, I can’t help but worry that the other person might have some ulterior motive. Is it because my personality is twisted...? No, no, maybe that’s not entirely wrong.

<b>

"Did you think I was a god who only acted for rewards?"

<b>

"‘Former god’—you’re living as a human now, right?"

<b>

"Hehehe... Well, yes. I’m a human, just like you guys."
