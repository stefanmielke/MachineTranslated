# A-64 Pre-return Trial of Strength

<b>

<b>

<b>

The days after receiving encouragement from my friends passed quite busily.

I helped Nīzu-kun with his report writing, went to an S-rank dungeon with the five of ASR to conquer it, and toured the city of Aldia, among other things.

<b>

Originally, it felt like a way to kill time until the expansion of my house in the Lindale Kingdom was completed, but I think it was fulfilling enough for a filler.

There were times when I worried about what was to come, but my friends helped me resolve those feelings. Well, they didn't actually solve it, but they showed me a way forward.

Even after conquering all the S-rank dungeons, it's uncertain what will happen in this world. However, there are people who care about me this much nearby. I can't just keep moping around.

<b>

"Are we having a mock battle with the 'Crimson Sword'? That's fine with me."

<b>

Around noon the day after we returned to the royal capital of Palmur from conquering the S-rank dungeon in Aldia.

Neska-san visited the inn where we were staying, looking somewhat embarrassed, and asked, "Would you have a mock battle with my party?"

Since the house in Lindale would soon be completed, I didn't know when I would meet Neska-san again. Since I had nothing else to do, I immediately agreed.

<b>

"Oh, I'm sorry for deciding without asking. Is it okay with Sera and the others?"

<b>

"Sure. I didn't have any particular plans."

<b>

"I'm fine with it too~"

<b>

"I'm okay as well."

<b>

In response to my question, Sera, Noah, and Fenon each replied. By the way, Shiri nodded in agreement with Fenon.

<b>

"Since everyone seems to be okay with it, shall we go ahead? But... what do we do? Us five against your party—ah, how many do you have on your side?"

<b>

"We also have five."

<b>

"I see. Then the numbers are just right."

<b>

"Hahaha, indeed, if you only look at the numbers, it seems fair."

<b>

Neska-san said with a wry smile and let out a deep sigh.

<b>

"As for the difference in strength, it's like heaven and earth. And the four in my party don't understand that... If possible, I'd like to show those clueless ones the power of Esuāru-sama."

<b>

"Ah... So only Neska-san among the 'Crimson Sword' has seen that match."

<b>

This means that the other four have only heard about me through others.

I recall that feeling of having my strength doubted, reminiscent of when I first conquered a B-rank dungeon... I think I was called a "goldfish's tail" by the explorers.

If I remember correctly, I demonstrated my strength by participating in a martial arts tournament back then, right? I also recall having a lot of fun in the match against the Thunderbolt's trajectory and getting a bit carried away. Those were nostalgic memories.

<b>

"It really irritates me when Esuāru is seen as weak. I understand that feeling."

<b>

Sera said that and nodded, while Fenon agreed, saying, "That's true."

<b>

"Haha... Well, I don't intend to hide it anymore, and if you want me to beat you up, I can do that. However, I don't want it to be thought that the party only stands because of me, so could you have Sera and the other four participate in the mock battle as well? I think you've seen Sera and Noah's fight, but Fenon and Shiri are quite strong too."

<b>

While their skills may still be inferior to Neska-san's, Fenon and the others have higher stats.

In terms of strength, speed, and durability, Fenon and the others are superior to anyone in this country.

<b>

"I-I see... So even Princess Fenon is included..."

<b>

"Yes. If you underestimate us just because we're a mere princess and maid, you might end up regretting it, you know?"

<b>

Well, it's the same for Fenon and the others; they shouldn't let their guard down either.

Just because their stats are superior doesn't mean they can win easily. In fact, if it were just Fenon or Shiri, they would probably lose to Neska-san.

<b>

Player skill is an important factor for that reason.

<b>

"Wow, so you're Esuāru. You seem pretty ordinary."

<b>

"You don't look very strong."

<b>

We were supposed to meet at the guild's training ground, but as soon as I joined up with the four members of Neska-san's party, a couple of them with somewhat harsh expressions made those comments. The other two didn't say anything in particular and just looked at me with a "hmm" expression.

<b>

"Stop it! If you insult Esuāru-sama, I won't forgive you!"

<b>

Neska-san, who leads the 'Crimson Sword', said that, and the two replied, "It's not an insult~," and "It's just an opinion," while laughing. Well, they didn't mock my wives, so I guess it's fine.

Neska-san is probably being considerate of me, but in reality, it wasn't something that could be called an insult, and it wasn't worth getting worked up over.

At least, that's what I thought.

<b>

"Alright. Then I'll crush these two first—"

<b>

"Hey, hey, what good does it do for you to get angry?"

<b>

"Because these guys are talking about Esuāru..."

<b>

Sera said that and pouted slightly. It seems she's sulking. Cute.

<b>

"That's right, Sera. I'll join you too."

<b>

"Hey, Fenon, don't join in!"

<b>

"I-I won't stay silent either!"

<b>

"Then I guess I'll join in too~."

<b>

"Wait, wait, why are you all so combative!? Let's handle this more peacefully!"

<b>

Why is it that a simple trial of strength mock battle feels like a fight!?

Since it's a fun event, let's enjoy it more!

<b>

But somehow, the atmosphere from the opposing couple also felt like, "Oh? Are we going to do this?" and it seemed like we might just jump straight into the match.

That's fine, but I hope we don't end up with injuries that require an elixir... Since it's a party battle, it won't just be a match with wooden swords, so there will be some injuries, but magic can't be held back like weapons.

<b>

If anyone from ASR ends up bleeding, I might not be able to conduct the mock battle gently after all.
