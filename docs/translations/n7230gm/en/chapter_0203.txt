# A-86 I Want to Save the Princess with All My Heart

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing the discussion at the Explorer Guild, I arrived at the hall with the reception area, where I found not only explorers enjoying their ale at the table but also a girl who seemed out of place in the surrounding atmosphere. Well, that would be Noah.

<b>

"Welcome back, big brother. Did the discussion end?"

<b>

"Yeah, it’s over. — So, what are you doing here?"

<b>

"I came to kill time since there's nothing to do at the party house! The Thunderbolt's Trail is a dungeon, and Phenon and Shiri went to the royal castle."

<b>

"Hm? What happened to Sera?"

<b>

When Crescent asked this, a bearded explorer answered in Noah's stead.

<b>

"The sword princess went to the training ground — by the way, you’re a new face, but are you a member of ASR?"

<b>

"Well, something like that."

<b>

With that, Crescent started a conversation with the unfamiliar explorer without hesitation. Well, there were plenty of characters with such appearances in Tempest, so she might be used to it. There were even weirder skins out there.

<b>

But you know... even though Crescent is joining the party, her purpose for diving into dungeons in this world is no longer to make money. She has already maxed out all her jobs, so there’s really nothing for her to do except support Sera and the others.

<b>

The members of ASR and the Thunderbolt's Trail have currently obtained all the secondary job status bonuses, and some have obtained the level 30 bonuses for their third jobs, while others have not. I have leveled up the Demon Lord, Sword Saint, and Spirit Archer to level 100. Only the Saint remains, but if I take my time with dungeon exploration, it will likely cap out on its own.

<b>

Well, since we’re adding one more to the existing five members, someone will have to sit out — no, since Crescent is here, we could split into two parties and act separately.

<b>

"Just because I came to this world doesn’t mean I have to live as an explorer."

<b>

"Hm... well, that’s true. If Crescent isn’t particularly interested in dungeons, she can use this place as a refuge."

<b>

"Yeah, yeah, that’s right. I think it’s important to interact with various people like this. If you just stay holed up at home, you won’t have any encounters."

<b>

Is this brat talking to me about my past life... I can’t even retort.

<b>

"I’ll make sure not to become a NEET."

<b>

When I said that, Noah laughed happily.

<b>

I joined up with Sera, who looked refreshed after beating up some explorers at the training ground, and we returned to the party house as a group of four. Shiri and Phenon had already returned, and even the members of the Thunderbolt's Trail were relaxing in the living room.

<b>

"Huh? Shin and the others are here too. Are you done with the dungeon?"

<b>

"Yeah, welcome back. We’ve been diving into dungeons a lot lately, so I figured it would be risky to push too hard and make mistakes, so we retreated today."

<b>

"That’s right. Shin was getting a bit too eager, so I forced him to come back."

<b>

"Shin has been feeling competitive with Crescent-chan. He was frustrated after getting completely wrecked."

<b>

In response to my question, the members of the Thunderbolt's Trail each replied.

Sitting across from them on the sofa, Phenon and Shiri were smiling wryly. By the way, Shin had turned red and looked away. Ha, caught out!

<b>

"Well, Crescent has more experience, so don’t worry about it. If you die in a panic, it won’t do you any good."

<b>

"I was told the same thing by those two... Well, first I need to be able to win against Sera at least 80% of the time before worrying about Crescent."

<b>

"What’s your current win rate?"

<b>

"I think it’s about even, 50-50."

<b>

"Oh... you guys are really having a good match."

<b>

The two of them are currently acquiring status bonuses at a similar pace, but their records fluctuate between 6 to 4 and 4 to 6, maintaining a balance. There’s a better rival than Crescent. Well, Shin is probably full of motivation because he couldn’t even land a hit right now.

<b>

"Well, you know, being competitive is incredibly important in battles like this. Of course, having teammates who can advise against going too far is just as important."

<b>

Crescent said this and turned to Sera, seeking agreement.

She nodded and then looked at me.

<b>

"When Esuar helps Phenon, the fundamental reason was also 'I don’t want to lose,' right?"

<b>

"Hehe, that’s very Esuar-like, isn’t it?"

<b>

At Sera’s words, Phenon smiled brightly. Is that really okay, Phenon?

<b>

"Yeah... Esuar-san, it would be better to say something like 'I want to save the princess with all my heart'..."

<b>

At that time, I was told the same thing by Sera... my bad.
