# A-118 Village? Discovery

<b>

<b>

<b>

As a result of Jade risking herself to verify the degree of pain, it became clear that in this dungeon, which does not lead to death, the sense of pain operates just like in reality. Although it has the same specifications as the game Tempest, it seems that pain is not treated the same way.

<b>

This is somewhat reassuring.

<b>

Getting used to mild pain in this place means that when I experience actual pain outside, my body won’t stiffen up.

However, for now, I feel a bit anticlimactic.

<b>

The enemies aren't that strong, and even though it's a vast world, that's all there is to it for now. There are still many places I haven't seen—rather, I don't even know how expansive this dungeon is, so it's foolish to judge it that way.

<b>

“Hmm?”

<b>

As we walked in a straight line with seven people from the starting point, I spotted something in the distance that wasn't a natural object. As we got closer, it became clear that it was a building, and then I realized it was a house, and that there were dozens of them lined up.

<b>

A town...? No, it seems more like a village, but could there be NPC-like characters here?

Cautiously, we approached the village with the seven of us—however,

<b>

“It seems uninhabited.”

<b>

It's not accurate since we didn't knock on the door, but at the moment we got close, there was no sign of people at all.

There were roads neatly arranged in a grid pattern, totaling seven by seven. It was clear without counting each house that there were forty-nine buildings in total.

<b>

It feels devoid of life... All the houses are clean, and the architectural styles are varied; it doesn't feel like they were built by people. It might be due to the impression that Lady Idea prepared this.

<b>

“L-look, Esuar! Some text has appeared!”

<b>

“Hmm? Oh, you're right.”

<b>

Sera stood in front of the entrance of a stone house, and a pale blue window floated before her.

As I walked closer and asked, “What does it say?” she tilted her head and read the text aloud.

<b>

“Um... it says, ‘3-A No Owner. Price 5 Coins’... What does it mean by coins? Can't we use money?”

<b>

“I think it means there's a currency that can only be used within this dungeon.”

<b>

Jade answered Sera's question. I think so too—but how do we obtain these coins in a world without people?

If we think in standard terms, it would be through treasure chests or drops from monsters.

<b>

Hmm... For now, what I understand is that we can acquire this house, but we can't do it right away. After all, we don't even know what these coins are.

<b>

Noah, the original deity, also seems to be unsure, as she crossed her arms and hummed.

<b>

“Maybe they drop from boss-type monsters.”

<b>

“Can you tell which ones are bosses?”

<b>

In a normal dungeon, they would clearly indicate with words like “Challenge the Boss,” but what is a boss in reality? Oh, wait, it’s not reality, though.

<b>

“Who knows?”

<b>

“Doesn't it feel like they’re boss-level in terms of strength?”

<b>

“Well, that thought is fine.”

<b>

In any case, since we plan to defeat all the monsters we encounter, it might not matter whether they are bosses or not. It could be difficult to defeat them all if a massive outbreak occurs, though.

<b>

Ah, I hadn't thought about that.

<b>

In the original dungeon, the number of monsters was determined by level, but that doesn't apply in this world. There’s a possibility that hundreds of them could attack at once.

<b>

“For now, it might be better to head back after this for today. The people outside don’t know the current situation, so they’re probably worried.”

<b>

“““Ehh”””

<b>

My voice, along with Crescent and Jade's, overlapped. It was perfectly the Earth members.

<b>

“It might be hard for Phenon and Shiri to say it, and Noah would probably prioritize Esuar, so if I don’t say it, Esuar and the others will likely keep pushing forward, right? If it’s the Esuar I know, they’d probably say something like, ‘Let’s go look for the boss!’”

<b>

Damn, how well does Sera understand me? I want to confirm if they drop coins. I want to see what they are. And if I can confirm that they drop coins, I want to actually buy a house.

<b>

Next, I’d want to gather coins and buy all the houses in this village and think, “Which house should I stay in today?” That sounds fun.

<b>

“Sera, if you say here, ‘I want to defeat the boss too!’ Esuar’s favorability will skyrocket!”

<b>

“Yes! Esuar, I want to defeat the boss too!”

<b>

Crescent's sweet temptation caught Phenon, and Shiri next to her timidly raised her hand and said, “Me too.”

<b>

“Well, if my big brother wants to go, I won’t stop him.”

<b>

“We can report about the boss together, so it should be fine, right?”

<b>

Noah and Jade also expressed their agreement, and this turned into a six-to-one situation. Sera, who should be saying the right thing, had a frustrated expression.

<b>

“...I-I want to defeat the boss too!”

<b>

“Are you trying to raise your favorability? You don’t have to do that—”

<b>

“Shut up!”

<b>

In any case, we decided to continue the exploration. To those waiting outside, I truly apologize.
