# 80 Ring and Necklace

<b>

<b>

<b>

After the party celebrating my first anniversary of summoning, the unchanging daily life returned once again.

The Thunderbolt Trail resumed its activities towards conquering A-rank dungeons, and I was leveling up in a different A-rank dungeon while educating Sera and the others.

<b>

Thanks to that—or rather, since the Thunderbolt Trail is in a waiting state to conquer, I have already obtained all the bonuses for secondary and derived secondary jobs. My status has already been refined to the point where I can conquer S-rank dungeons.

<b>

☆Status☆

<b>

Name: Esuar

Age: 19

Occupation: Magic Archer

Level: 63

STR: B

VIT: C

AGI: B

DEX: A

INT: S

MND: B

Skills: Stealth, Projectile Magic, Magic Arrow

<b>

<b>

With such status, conquering S-rank dungeons is easy.

However, if I were to fight Venom, I would need to have all the bonuses from the third job as well.

<b>

Well, there’s no need to push myself to challenge the Overlord Venom.

More than that, I need to face reality now.

<b>

“I’m not good at choosing presents like this…”

<b>

Today is my solo day off.

<b>

Normally, I would be diving into an A-rank dungeon, but today I came to the city of Renus. The purpose, of course, is to buy rings for Sera and Phenon. I also plan to buy a necklace for Shiri.

<b>

I intend to give Sera and Phenon a bouquet as well, but since I don’t want them to wilt, I plan to purchase it just before giving it to them.

<b>

These will be presented when the A-rank dungeon is conquered and the S-rank dungeon appears.

This also carries the implication of “I’m heading into a dangerous dungeon, but I hope to continue relying on you.”

<b>

I researched their schedules in advance and confirmed that they would be relaxing at home today, so I can shop without sneaking around. That said, I have become somewhat famous due to the martial arts tournament, so I do attract some glances.

<b>

I decided to buy the presents at a store that is favored by Duke Margus, the lord of this city.

It’s not that I’m trying to use Duke Margus’s influence to get a discount; it’s just that there are so many stores that I have no idea which one is good, so I thought it would be safe to ask him.

<b>

For someone like me, who is originally a commoner, the luxurious appearance of the store seems intimidating to enter.

After taking a few deep breaths, I entered the store, and immediately a young male clerk approached me. When I mentioned the introduction from Duke Margus, the clerk quickly changed.

A woman in her thirties, who seemed to be the manager, appeared.

As soon as she saw my face, she showed a look of astonishment. However, being a store introduced by a duke, her surprised expression was not vulgar.

<b>

“It is a great honor to have you, Hero Esuar. What are you looking for today?”

<b>

“Ah… I’m sorry. I don’t really like being called a hero, so if possible, just my name would be fine. Today, I’m looking for a necklace and two rings.”

<b>

When I said that, the female clerk bowed deeply and apologized, saying, “I apologize for the offense.”

No, no, you don’t need to apologize that seriously. I may have received a title and might have connections with powerful people, but I’m just a commoner who is fine with instant noodles for every meal.

<b>

“For now, I’d like to see the necklaces.”

<b>

“Understood. I will be your guide today. My name is Meriru. Please take care of me.”

<b>

“Yes, thank you for your guidance.”

<b>

I have no idea about the types of gemstones, and I don’t really know women’s preferences, so it’s helpful to have someone lead me in situations like this. When I’m choosing for myself, I tend to think, “Let me look at it slowly!”

<b>

You don’t need to use honorifics with me—oh, but she is indeed—while having such conversations, Meriru picks out recommended items for me.

<b>

The items introduced are all priced over 10 million yen, but since it doesn’t hurt my wallet at all, I don’t mind. In fact, since I was struggling with how to use my money, I should spend it to help boost the economy.

Fortunately, since I’m showing my connection to the duke, I shouldn’t be overcharged.

<b>

The necklace for Shiri is not one that Meriru introduced; it’s one that I intuitively thought would suit her.

<b>

It features a golden chain with a decoration resembling a hawk or eagle, with an emerald green gemstone set in its eyes.

<b>

The price tag read 1.5 million Or (15 million yen), but thanks to the invisible pressure from the duke’s family, they gave it to me for 1 million Or.

Since it’s a present, I had no intention of negotiating the price, but it felt awkward to refuse Meriru’s consideration, so I thanked her.

<b>

And now, the problem of the rings.

<b>

“They say it should be three months’ salary…”

<b>

I muttered in a small voice so that Meriru wouldn’t hear.

Considering my salary back in Japan, the items I could buy at this jewelry store are limited, and if I think about three months’ worth of my current income—there are no products in that price range because the amounts are too high.

<b>

I guess I should choose based on shape, color, and whether they would suit them, ignoring the price.

<b>

Ah! This is tough! But I don’t want to compromise with “This will do!”

<b>

I continued to seriously observe the products while listening to Meriru’s explanations, with my arms crossed.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

“Choosing presents takes this much energy… Fighting a boss in a dungeon is still better.”

<b>

After finishing my shopping, I headed home via an A-rank dungeon.

Although I’m not diving into a dungeon, if they see me returning from the direction of the city, they might get suspicious.

Since I want to surprise them, I want to pull off a successful prank.

<b>

The rings for Sera and Phenon are exactly the same in design.

<b>

They are crafted to look like petals of Yukarimusubi, with gemstones wrapped inside, and the moment Meriru introduced them, I decided, “This is it!”

<b>

The only difference is the type of gemstone.

Sera’s is a red gemstone that seems even deeper than ruby, while Phenon’s is a white gemstone with a luster like a pearl. Both are colors I’ve never seen on Earth.

<b>

In terms of price, let’s say it’s enough to build a fairly luxurious house.

<b>

“I hope they’ll be happy…”

<b>

I feel anxious. But at the same time, I’m excited.

I can’t help but imagine what kind of reactions they will show—it’s enough to make me feel like the day will end just thinking about it. Until the Thunderbolt Trail conquers the A-rank dungeon, I need to be careful not to let it slip.

<b>

“I’m looking forward to it.”

<b>

From the window of my house, I see Phenon smiling and waving at me. That joyful expression spread even to me, who was far away.

Feeling my cheeks relax, I waved back.
