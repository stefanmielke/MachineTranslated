# A-81 Resolving Through Battle?

<b>

<b>

That night.

After saying goodnight to my companions, I sat on the sofa with Crescent. Of course, we weren't sitting side by side; we were facing each other.

<b>

While sipping the tea that Shiri had prepared, our conversation naturally revolved around this world. The last time we talked, it was a rushed explanation, so I had omitted the details, and when discussing the future of this world, I expected good opinions to come from Noah at the same level.

<b>

"So, is the 'Overlord' class currently a unique job only for you, Esuar?"

<b>

"Well, that's how it is. Apparently, if you defeat me, you can obtain it, but do you want to wager your class on it?"

<b>

"Hahaha... Well, even without the class, I wanted to spar with you again, so I’d like to request the Overlord for that time!"

<b>

"Understood. That said, I've already fought and won against your 'Moon' copies as the Overlord, you know?"

<b>

"I didn't want to hear that... And copies are just too fantastical."

<b>

"That's a bit late to say."

<b>

"True."

<b>

As we chatted about trivial matters, the clock passed eleven at night.

Shiri had said she would stay up until we went to bed, but I had asked Phanon to make her go to sleep forcefully. It might be a habit of hers as a maid to take care of us, but that would prevent us from having a leisurely conversation.

<b>

"However, I'm really glad you came. There was the loneliness of not having anyone from my hometown, but more than that, it was the lack of a worthy opponent. Venom is gone, and even the former god here—Noah—doesn't seem that great in combat skills."

<b>

"I don't think I can compete with you, Esuar."

<b>

Crescent said this with a wry smile, but her skills are undeniably real. Without this eye I received from Noah, I wouldn't actually know who is stronger—though I don't plan on losing. If I do lose, I'll just keep practicing until I win.

<b>

"For now, I'll lightly talk about my future plans. After hearing that, decide how you want to spend your time. You can act alone or with us."

<b>

"Got it."

<b>

After confirming Crescent's response, I talked about wanting to conquer all the S-rank dungeons. Currently, I had completed the dungeons in the Lindale Kingdom and the Palmour Kingdom, and I was thinking of heading to the Rezel Kingdom where the Vinzett siblings are.

<b>

If she were an ordinary person, I would encourage her to act together with me, considering that solo actions might be dangerous, but honestly, there probably isn't anyone or any monster in this world that could defeat her. Even if it were ten against one, she would easily take them down.

<b>

So, I prioritized her will, but her answer was to "act together." I thought she might say something like, "I want to enjoy the real Tempest," but is she actually a bit lonely?

<b>

"That's not entirely wrong, but even though it's a world I'm familiar with, I still feel anxious. The only acquaintance I have is you, Esuar, and in a fantasy world—well, I might get stripped and attacked by ruffians..."

<b>

"Ah... I see. You're scared because you might end up killing someone with your own hands."

<b>

"Why are you assuming I'll be on the receiving end of an attack!? That's rude towards a delicate maiden!"

<b>

"—Hmph."

<b>

"You laughed through your nose!? W-well, I did defeat Shin and the others, but there might be stronger people in other countries!"

<b>

"By the way, Shin and the others won the international martial arts tournament where representatives from various countries participated."

<b>

"No escape!? Are you actually a bully, Esuar!?"

<b>

Crescent complained in a high-pitched voice. I might have teased her a bit too much. I reflected on that.

I apologized sincerely and decided to have a more serious conversation.

<b>

"Honestly, I can't imagine you losing at all—but there is one thing that I think would be bad if it happened. I actually suffered from it myself. However, I'm honestly troubled about how to overcome it."

<b>

Upon hearing my words, Crescent tilted her head with a troubled expression. It seemed she wasn't quite getting it.

I could wait for a while until Crescent figured out the answer herself, but since it was getting late, I decided to give her the answer sooner.

<b>

"It's damage. In the game, there was some level of pain setting, but it was quite light."

<b>

I really thought I was going to die when I got punched by a Cyclops after coming to this world. That was when I experienced my first life flashback.

<b>

"I see. I thought I was somewhat used to it since I had set the feedback to the maximum, but in reality, it does interfere with movement, doesn't it?"

<b>

"Yeah. A clear example would be internal damage, right? If you cough up blood, it becomes hard to breathe."

<b>

"Ugh, that's gross..."

<b>

"I'm not saying you have to get used to that much, but I recommend trying to take some attacks while in a safe state with allies. Even if your arm gets blown off, you can get it back with an Elixir."

<b>

Saying this jokingly, she crossed her arms and furrowed her brow. I hope she isn't seriously thinking about cutting off her arm—I'd rather not see that scene, so if she really wants to do it, I hope she does it somewhere I'm not.

<b>

As I was thinking that, Crescent's face brightened—

<b>

"Then, if I challenge you, Esuar, everything will be resolved! Please beat me up like in the old ranking battles!"

<b>

She suddenly said that.
