# 59 The Value of the "Sword Saint"

<b>

<b>

<b>

Two days after the martial arts tournament ended.

I invited Jinrai no Kiseki and Sera――and then Regulus-san to my house.

<b>

It seems that Sera had a family party yesterday. Probably a celebration for her achievements in the martial arts tournament. Even though she lost to her sister, Rei-san is still the individual champion, so it must have been a joyous occasion for the family.

<b>

On the other hand, I had an early visit from Fenon-san and Shiri-san, so I was leisurely having tea and chatting with the two of them.

We discussed not only the martial arts tournament but also future plans. The conversation contained many topics that couldn't be shared elsewhere.

<b>

Ideally, it would be quicker to discuss future matters including Jinrai no Kiseki and Sera, but while Sera is fine, it seems that Shin and the others are not particularly close to the princess, so it would be easier for everyone to talk separately.

<b>

So today, I gathered the usual members, excluding Fenon-san and Shiri-san.

Regulus-san may not have spent as much time with us as the "usual members," but since we already share secrets, it’s easier to consult with him, so I invited him.

<b>

Perhaps because I invited them under the pretext of "providing additional information about professions," despite sitting on a presumably comfortable sofa, their bodies, except for one, seemed tense.

<b>

"Relax a bit, will you? If you’re like this, there’s no point in separating you from Fenon-san and the others."

<b>

"I say that, but… the things that come out of your mouth require some mental preparation; it’s tough on the psyche."

<b>

"Yes, yes. Of course, there’s a feeling of excitement."

<b>

"---But the fear outweighs it, doesn’t it?"

<b>

Jinrai no Kiseki, sitting across from me, responded with a strained expression.

Fenon-san and Shiri-san also looked bewildered when I brought up this topic.

<b>

Regulus-san, the oldest in this group, was sitting to my right. He looked down and muttered while covering his face with his palm.

<b>

"I guess I should listen too… right?"

<b>

It was a question that sounded almost like a soliloquy.

<b>

"It seems it would be easier to move if guild members knew about it. Since you are at the top among them, Regulus-san, it would help me if you were aware of the situation."

<b>

"Is it another type of information that can't be shared with His Majesty?"

<b>

"I will announce it eventually. Jinrai no Kiseki will."

<b>

I expect them to act in a way that befits the name "pioneers." Shine in my stead.

<b>

Shin replied with a wry smile, "I don’t mind that, but…" Good attitude.

<b>

"For now, let’s keep this under wraps. Now, let’s get to the main topic."

<b>

As I said this, Jinrai no Kiseki and Regulus-san gasped.

However, for some reason, Sera had been calm since she arrived at my house and showed no signs of nervousness even now as I was about to start talking.

Could it be that she gained confidence from the martial arts tournament and is no longer easily shaken by minor things? Regardless of the reason, it makes it easier for me to talk.

<b>

"Until now, you all have used the terms lower class, upper class, and derived upper class, but today we will stop calling them that. From now on, please refer to them as first class, second class, and derived second class."

<b>

At my words, Sera looked puzzled.

However, the other four seemed to have caught on quickly, their eyes widening and mouths moving in shock without making a sound.

<b>

The first to speak was Suzu.

She hesitated for a moment before asking, "I can’t believe I’m asking this, but…"

<b>

"Is there a third class above the upper class?"

<b>

Including Suzu, Shin, Laika, and Regulus-san looked at me with tense expressions. Sera was staring at me with a blank face.

<b>

"That’s exactly it. As expected, you all catch on quickly."

<b>

I won’t mention it, but there is one person who is not included in "you all." I won’t say who, but it’s the one with red hair.

<b>

"Wait, wait, wait… Are you serious?"

<b>

"I was surprised by the derived upper class—no, derived second class, but I didn’t expect to be surprised again like this."

<b>

"I really shouldn’t have asked…"

<b>

After Shin and the others showed their varied reactions, the person who had been excluded from "you all" finally spoke up.

<b>

"So, you mean it’s a super upper class—?!"

<b>

Well, that’s true. But let’s unify it under the term third class.

If I tell her about the Overlord, she might start saying "super super upper class." Yeah, that sounds like something she would say.

<b>

That aside.

<b>

"I plan for you all to prepare the foundation to become third class while conquering A-rank dungeons. After that, you’ll transition to third class and then tackle S-rank dungeons—that’s the flow. So—"

<b>

As I was about to get into the specifics, Shin interrupted me in a flustered manner, "Wait, wait!"

<b>

"What did you just say!?"

<b>

"I plan for you all to prepare the foundation to become third class while conquering A-rank dungeons."

<b>

I repeated the exact same words. However, Shin seemed unconvinced and leaned forward.

<b>

"It’s about what comes after that!"

<b>

"You’ll head to S-rank dungeons as third class. It’s tough to level up to third class with just A-rank dungeons, right? Unlike second class, the level cap is 100."

<b>

"Stop! Stop! SR stop! That’s too much information!"

<b>

"Please, spare me… What am I supposed to tell His Majesty…"

<b>

Oh boy… things are heating up.

Sera seems to have entered a state of mental shutdown, and Regulus-san looks like he’s about to cry.

<b>

Let’s calm down and resolve the questions one by one.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

In this world, S-rank dungeons do not yet exist.

<b>

And that’s understandable—no one has achieved the condition for the appearance of S-rank dungeons, which is "conquering A-rank dungeons."

The reason they panicked is that I suddenly started talking about dungeons they had never heard of. I completely forgot about that.

<b>

After finishing a rough explanation of S-rank dungeons for the five of them, I decided to discuss today’s main topic—the most troublesome one. I want to get the unpleasant part out of the way first.

<b>

As I was saying "uh" and "um," trying to figure out how to convey it, Sera confidently placed her hand on my shoulder.

<b>

"Trust me, SR. No matter how unreasonable or absurd the content may be, I will take it in stride. After all, I am the woman known as the second Sword Saint. I won’t be shaken by something like this."

<b>

With a smug smile, Sera said.

<b>

That’s not it, Sera. The problem isn’t the content of the conversation.

It’s something much simpler, and it will plunge only you into despair.

<b>

"As expected of the Sword Saint. So that’s why you weren’t nervous."

<b>

"Hehe—I aim to behave in a manner befitting the name of the Sword Saint."

<b>

This is bad. She’s digging her own grave.

I need to talk before my words become a fatal blow.

<b>

"Sera, Shin, Laika."

<b>

With an extremely serious expression and tone, I called the names of the three.

They all closed their mouths and turned their gazes toward me.

<b>

"There are two conditions to reach third class. First—level up three specified professions to level 60. The professions you will aim for are Kenkou, Gouketu, and Budou Kenshi."

<b>

Shin and Laika nodded quietly, as if to say, "I see."

The three professions I just mentioned have already been raised to over level 30 due to my instructions.

<b>

"Professions worthy of the Sword Saint—super swordsman…? No, that’s a bit off…"

<b>

Sera had entered a world of her own imagination. While I feel like leaving her be, I can’t do that.

I placed my hand on her shoulder, just as she did earlier, and said, "Listen carefully."

<b>

<b>

"The profession you will aim for is—'Sword Saint.'"

<b>

<b>

As I said this, I felt the air in the room freeze for an instant――or so it seemed.

<b>
