# A-7 The Use of Mind Reading

<b>

<b>

<b>

I want to ask you ASR for a job.

<b>

The guild master of the neighboring town, Raileth, said this to the five of us. However, his gaze was mainly directed towards Sera and Phenon. He probably thinks that these two hold the decision-making power.

<b>

Being on the sidelines during such times is actually quite comfortable. It's not that it's none of my business, so I can't just run away.

<b>

I also participated in the conversation without speaking, using Noah's mind-reading ability.

The little brat kindly picked up my thoughts like "Ugh, this is such a hassle" and "I haven't fully enjoyed the festival yet," which froze the atmosphere at times, but somehow we managed to end the conversation smoothly.

<b>

<b>

"A group of pickpockets, huh... With so many people around, it’s true that bumping into someone doesn’t stand out much."

<b>

Sera walked beside me, resting her chin on her hand and closing her eyes, furrowing her brow. Don't walk with your eyes closed, you idiot.

<b>

"We were asked to help calm down fights, but we should also keep an eye out for theft, right?"

<b>

The expression on Shiri's face as she said this was unusually serious. Just like Sera, she has a strong sense of justice.

<b>

According to Raileth, it seems that thefts are currently rampant in the royal capital.

<b>

The number of incidents has been increasing as the ceremony approaches—meaning as more people gather in the capital—and it seems there were over a hundred reports of theft yesterday.

<b>

From the flow of the conversation, I thought he was asking us to help find the culprits, but Raileth said, "I can't have someone with your abilities do that."

We were told that while enjoying the festival, we only needed to subdue anyone causing trouble.

<b>

In simple terms, it feels like we're helping the knight order.

<b>

"We were already on alert in the area, so even though we were asked to do a job, it doesn't really change what we have to do."

<b>

Even if Raileth hadn't asked us, if a serious fight broke out, I would have intervened anyway. Even if I tried to ignore it, Sera would probably charge in.

<b>

"But if there are a lot of criminals in this town—it makes me a bit uneasy. Everyone else is probably feeling anxious too, so I hope they get caught soon."

<b>

Phenon looked around with a troubled expression.

In her case, even though she is mainly active as an explorer now, she might feel a sense of responsibility due to her status as royalty.

<b>

"…Hmm."

<b>

It is indeed unsettling.

To resolve this quickly—it's probably not wise to just obediently follow Raileth's instructions. I need to take action on my own.

<b>

"If this continues, we won't be able to enjoy the festival to the fullest, right?"

<b>

Noah said, grinning and looking up at me.

Without needing to think, she is reading my thoughts right now. That's why she has that mischievous "I'm not a brat!" expression on her face.

<b>

"Alright, alright, I got it, Lady Noah. I understand, so get to work."

<b>

"You're still as demanding as ever, big brother."

<b>

"You're not even a person, are you?"

<b>

"I am a person! At least right now, I'm completely the same as you guys."

<b>

"More like a half-human, half-brat."

<b>

"Geez... You're such a dummy, big brother."

<b>

I lightly tapped Noah's head, which made her sulk immediately, her face showing dissatisfaction above her nose while her mouth was smiling. When I tried to pat her head again, she made a pouty face and her cheeks turned red.

<b>

It's quite amusing—but for now, let's finish our job. It's not the task Raileth asked us to do, but still.

<b>

"I'll buy you anything at the stalls later, so I'm counting on you."

<b>

"Seriously... I can't help it."

<b>

Though she sounded like it was a hassle, her tone was a bit cheerful as Noah began to lead us forward.

Her small back looked reliable, just like a former god.

<b>

I tried to follow her, but I felt someone tugging at the hem of my clothes from behind. When I turned around, six accusatory eyes were staring at me.

<b>

"What were the SRs talking about?"

<b>

"I absolutely have no idea. Can you explain it to us?"

<b>

"I could tell you were flirting, though."

<b>

Sera, Phenon, and Shiri spoke to me in order, their words filled with pressure.

For some reason, I felt like my movements were restricted, as if I had been hit by gravity magic. Are they all demon lords?

<b>

"S-sorry. It was just a habit."

<b>

Noah reads my mind without permission, so often conversations are established without me even having to say anything.

From the perspective of the people around us, they probably have no idea what kind of conversation is happening.

<b>

While it's an advantage for me, who doesn't want to stand out, it's not so good for my companions... We can't share strategies.

<b>

"Big brother, that person over there in the blue pants and white shirt, the one with the black shoulder bag."

<b>

As I was trying to explain to the three of them, Noah trotted over to my side. It seems she has already found a lead.

<b>

"I'll explain properly, so just wait a moment."

<b>

While saying this to Sera and the others, I took out a wooden sword from my inventory and immediately put it back in. It was a fleeting moment, lasting less than a second.

<b>

The Sword Saint's "Breaking Sword"—using it in the city is seriously unfair.

<b>

In my line of sight, the man in the white shirt that Noah had just pointed out was clutching his stomach and collapsing to his knees.

Even though I had held back quite a bit, with my STR, he wouldn't be able to stand up easily after being struck by a wooden sword. It wouldn't be surprising if a few ribs were broken.

<b>

A crowd had formed around the man, keeping a bit of distance. It’s no wonder they were surprised since someone suddenly collapsed.

<b>

"What happened? Was that done by the SR?"

<b>

"There didn't seem to be any signs of a fight..."

<b>

Because I hadn't explained properly, they were looking at me with blank expressions. They were cute.

<b>

"Since it's a festival, we definitely want to enjoy it to the fullest, right? Just like Phenon said earlier, I also feel uneasy in a town where criminals are lurking."

<b>

Of course, fights might break out, but that's something that happens at any festival. However, theft is different.

<b>

While glancing at Noah, who was approaching the fallen man and speaking to him, I continued explaining to the three of them.

<b>

"Earlier, Raileth mentioned 'group crimes,' right? So, if we catch one person, we can interrogate them and take down the whole organization."

<b>

If we do that, the knight order will handle the usual business of mediating fights, and we will be free from our duties.

We can fully enjoy the festival and watch Shin's parade calmly.

<b>

"But I think the knight order would at least interrogate them..."

<b>

"With something like theft, they might not be able to interrogate too harshly. If it were murder, they might go to the brink of killing, but—surely you don't mean to half-kill them and then douse them with potions, keeping them in a state of limbo between life and death, right—"

<b>

"Of course not, you idiot! That would be too cruel!"

<b>

"I-it was a joke! Ah, ha ha ha ha!"

<b>

You definitely weren't joking, Sera. That's scary.

<b>

"We don't need to do anything like that; we have Noah with us."

<b>

No interrogation, threats, or corporal punishment are necessary.

We have a brat who can use mind-reading—"I'm not a brat!"—a former god with us.

<b>

"Just by asking questions, the answers will come back."
