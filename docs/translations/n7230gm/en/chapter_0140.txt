<b>

The next day.

<b>

The five of us from ASR and the Thunder Trail met with the contractors early in the morning for a meeting about the new building being constructed in the royal capital.

<b>

Three men, who seemed to be dignitaries, attended to us, but all three were trembling and sweating profusely, making it exhausting for us to watch.

From the very beginning, they were like, "Y-y-y-y-yes, nice to meet you!" If it had been a cute girl, it might have been endearing, but hearing it from a bearded old man only elicited a wry smile. Please, just reincarnate.

<b>

Anyway, we spent a little time, but we successfully paid the deposit, and the discussion ended with the agreement to pay the remaining amount upon completion. I believe it will be a building that everyone can be satisfied with.

We decided to leave the minor adjustments during construction to the Thunder Trail remaining in the royal capital, and we aimed for Renas.

<b>

"Well then, our usual long journey is about to begin, so what shall we do?"

<b>

It takes about eight hours by carriage to travel from the royal capital to the commercial city of Renas.

I can't count how many times I've thought, "If only there were cars in this world," but I've surprisingly gotten used to this inconvenient situation. Rather than getting used to it, it feels more accurate to say I've come to terms with it.

<b>

The seats in the carriage are arranged in a U-shape, with Noah and Sera sitting next to each other, and Shiri and Fenon sitting next to each other, while I have the spacious seat all to myself, facing the direction of travel.

<b>

Besides us, there is one coachman handling the horses and one knight sitting next to him for unforeseen circumstances.

It seems unusual for the first princess of the country to have only one knight as her escort, but from our perspective, having more people would only be a hindrance, so it's a bit of a nuisance, to put it mildly. Thus, it has turned into a compromise on both sides.

<b>

"Well, how about we talk about our new home in a safe manner?"

<b>

What Shiri means by "safe" is content that wouldn't be problematic if overheard by the coachman or knight.

Of course, we can't talk about marriage, dungeons, or our dealings with the Thunder Trail.

However, it would be tedious to even adjust our way of speaking, so I leave it as it is.

<b>

"Speaking of which, Fenon, you asked the king for servants, right? What kind of people will come?"

<b>

"Yes. I requested that there be a small number of capable individuals, as too many would be noisy. I also conveyed your request for them to be easy to talk to and reliable, Mr. Esuar."

<b>

"Oh, thank you. So it'll be a surprise on the day itself."

<b>

"I'll be able to tell right away if they're up to no good. In that case, I'll send them back."

<b>

"Depending on the situation, they might end up in prison."

<b>

They are having a rather ominous conversation with cute faces.

I didn't mention that Noah can read minds, but the coachman and knight are probably trembling right now.

<b>

Seeing the two of them smile mischievously, Shiri, who had been smiling wryly, suddenly clapped her hands as if remembering something.

<b>

"What will we do in Renas? Will it be the same as before?"

<b>

"Huh? Are you talking about the dungeon?"

<b>

Could it be that we are about to conquer an A-rank dungeon or something like that?

<b>

"No, I meant about where we will live. We are building a house separate from you Esuar folks, so I was wondering if it would be there again."

<b>

Oh, that.

<b>

The house where Noah and I live is located on a hill a bit away from the city, assuming we would be going to the dungeon.

<b>

Fenon and the others are building their house within the city of Renas, so they will gather at the house where Noah and I live before heading to the dungeon—it's a bit of a hassle for Shiri and the others.

<b>

"Hmm... it's still difficult for Fenon and Sera, even if it's just Shiri."

<b>

It's mainly due to their status.

<b>

I feel like I've been acting weak lately, which is making it harder for me to move around.

After being reincarnated into this world, I wanted to enjoy a bit of freedom and had everyone cooperate with me, but this feels counterproductive.

<b>

"Just Shiri won't do. That's unfair."

<b>

"That's right! If Shiri goes, then I will go too! I don't care about what others say!"

<b>

"Now, now, both of you, you're going to trouble big brother."

<b>

With a triumphant expression, Noah said this, and not only Fenon and Sera but also Shiri shot her a sharp look. It sounded like a soothing remark, but you were definitely provoking her.

<b>

In times like this, I wondered if I should say, "Stop! Don't fight over me!" but I figured such lines only come from manga or novels, and it feels a bit strange for a guy to say that, so I held back.

<b>

"Even if I try to hide it, it doesn't feel like 'freedom' in the end. So once we have a new house and return to the royal capital, I think we should move—at least that's what I believe. Arnold and Jill already know, so it would be impossible to keep hiding it."

<b>

So for now, I decided to keep a low profile in Renas—when the three of them stood up, looking like they were about to burst with joy, asking, "Really!?" Noah looked a bit bored, though.

<b>

"Ah, I can't keep dragging you along with my selfishness forever. Well, if I work hard and the king and the count don't recognize it—"

<b>

"In that case, it's time for a foreign escape!"

<b>

"Indeed! Well, I don't think it will come to that with Esuar."

<b>

My future brides are decisive, aren't they?

<b>

...Brides, huh.

<b>

Just thinking about it made me a little embarrassed. When will my romantic level ever rise...? I wish it would show up in my status. Probably level 1, though.

<b>

As I was alone, writhing in shame, Noah, without seeming to care about me, called out, "Hey."

<b>

"For now, I'll celebrate Sera and the others' marriage, but make sure to leave some room for welcoming the other two, okay?"

<b>

At those words, Fenon and Sera smiled in a somewhat heartwarming manner. Noah wore a smile like a child anticipating a field trip tomorrow, while Shiri's face turned bright red as she looked down, clearly flustered.

<b>

Isn't that practically a confession? And Shiri got dragged into it too. What kind of expression should I have in response?

<b>

"I'll become a man worthy of everyone."

<b>

Without making a definitive statement, I let those words suffice.

I want to respond to the affections of the new two after Sera and Fenon, who have liked me for a long time. Sera might not mind, but I can't be satisfied unless I do it this way.

<b>

...Still, four, huh. It feels like I've not only exhausted my popularity from my previous life but also used up my share for the next life.

<b>

Sorry about that, future me.

<b>

I might end up living a life with no ties to women, but perhaps I'll be blessed with talents in games and reincarnate into a fantasy world with monsters and thieves, something unimaginable in Japan.

<b>

However, there's no need to fear the new world.

<b>

There may be hardships, but it should surely lead to a wonderful life. That's what those with experience say.
