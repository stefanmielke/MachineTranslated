# A-58 A Rank Dungeon

<b>

<b>

<b>

About three hours after departing from the royal capital.

We arrived at our destination, Aldia.

<b>

From this town, it takes about a 15-minute walk to the A Rank Dungeon and about a 20-minute carriage ride to the S Rank Dungeon.

C Rank and D Rank dungeons are even closer, but we don't have any particular business with them this time, so we won't be diving in.

<b>

Upon entering the town, we decided to split up for a while.

Nees-kun and Neska-san went to greet the lord who governs this town, while the three of us—me, Sera, and Noah—headed to the inn guided by a soldier.

<b>

I thought I should also greet the lord, but Nees-kun said, "Esuaar-kun, you guys take it easy. You don't like this kind of thing, right?" With such considerate words, I gratefully decided to take him up on his kindness.

<b>

<b>

Currently, the three of us from ASR, including me, are gathered in a room at the inn, idly passing the time while waiting for Nees-kun and the others to come back. They said they would return in about 30 minutes, so they should be arriving soon.

<b>

"Do you have any plans regarding this raid?"

<b>

As I sat in a chair, swinging my legs, Sera, who was sitting on the bed, spoke up.

<b>

Plans, huh... I hadn't really thought about it much.

<b>

"Putting Neska-san aside, we definitely need a guard for Nees-kun, right? When diving into an A Rank dungeon, it should be fine if one person is on guard. For the S Rank, I'll have Sera and Noah guard, and I'll go solo."

<b>

"That might be a good idea. Are you not going to let Neska fight?"

<b>

"Of course, I'll let her fight. I want to see what the top of the Palmur Kingdom is like, and Neska-san has probably had some experience with the lower levels of A Rank."

<b>

Although she will be fighting solo and not with our usual party members... well, it should be fine. If it comes to it, I can step in to help.

I wonder how capable Neska-san really is, I thought as Sera timidly raised her hand and looked at me as if she wanted to speak. "Go ahead, Sera-kun," I said in a teacher-like manner.

<b>

"Esuaar was talking in the carriage about wanting to level up a profession, right? If it's a late-stage secondary profession, that should be fine, but what if it's a low-level profession?"

<b>

"Oh wow! That’s true!"

<b>

Oh no, I completely forgot about that.

If that's the case, it might be a bad idea to let her fight alone. Exploring dungeons is a glamorous job for me, but it's still a matter of life and death.

<b>

"Then when I let Neska-san fight, I'll take the lead and have her assist me. If it looks dangerous, I can protect her, and since I don't want her to fight all the time, it should be fine."

<b>

The original goal is for her and Nees-kun to understand the contents of the A Rank and S Rank dungeons.

Even though we are in a cooperative position, there are limits to how much I can push my own desires onto them.

<b>

"As this is an A Rank dungeon in our own country, you should understand that as long as you are cautious about the front and back in these cave stages, there shouldn't be any problems. However, if you get caught in a pincer attack, it becomes difficult to escape, so be careful about that."

<b>

First floor of the A Rank dungeon.

On either side of Nees-kun, who is wearing somewhat overly decorated armor, are Sera and Noah.

At first glance, it looks like he has flowers in both hands, but one is my wife, and the other is a former god. And above all, Nees-kun looks too tense to worry about such things.

It's his first A Rank dungeon, so it's understandable.

<b>

"The second and fourth floors have flying monsters that move quickly. In their case, rather than getting caught in a pincer, you should be wary of attacks from blind spots. They also attack from a distance, and if you're not focused, it's hard to hear the sounds."

<b>

As I casually walked through the dungeon, explaining this, Neska-san, who was walking beside me, spoke up apologetically.

<b>

"Um, if my memory serves me right, I believe our party reached the highest floor of this dungeon... Did Esuaar-sama come here before?"

<b>

Oh no, I spoke without thinking again. That was close.

From her reaction, it seems she hasn't experienced reaching the fourth floor? Or maybe she hasn't even reached the second floor yet?

<b>

"Well, let's just say that's a secret. How far did your party get?"

<b>

"We only made it to the third floor."

<b>

In response to my question, Neska-san answered while keeping an eye on her surroundings. Good tension. But I think it's fine since Sera and Noah are on guard behind us.

<b>

In any case, it seems she has sufficient combat experience against the enemies on the first floor. This time, she seems to have come as a martial artist and said her level is over 50.

<b>

"As I said before we entered, I want to see you fight, Neska-san. Can you handle it alone? If it seems difficult, I'll assist you."

<b>

I don't want to force someone who is reluctant.

If she's not enthusiastic about it, it doesn't seem to mean much to watch, and I wouldn't want to be disliked over this.

<b>

"I'll do it! Please let me!"

<b>

Despite my concerns, Neska-san seemed full of determination, gripping the sword in her hand tightly.

I'm not a teacher, but why does she seem so spirited like a new recruit on their first assignment?

<b>

Well, she seems to be a front-line job originally, so I'm a bit worried, but I think I'll just watch over her at first.

<b>

"Understood. If we encounter enemies, I'll step back, so please take care of it."

<b>

Just in case, I'll activate body enhancement with Byakuren when the battle starts.

If she gets seriously injured because of this, I would feel crushed by guilt.
