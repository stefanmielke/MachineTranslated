# 12 Another Motivation

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Thank you for the ten days of escort."

<b>

It was just past midnight. After finishing the rounds of the D-rank dungeon, I bowed my head to Sera.

<b>

Swordsman, brawler, archer, knight, priest.

I was able to raise the levels of these five professions to exactly level 30 over the past ten days. I had raised my level a bit in the F-rank dungeon before getting an escort, but I think I did well.

<b>

"First of all, this is a penalty for me. You don't need to thank me, SR."

<b>

Since that day when I said I 'disliked' her, I haven't had any conversation with Sera other than business-like exchanges. We originally had few conversations, but it feels like it's decreased even more.

<b>

"Also, the guild master called for you. He wants you to come to the guild tomorrow or the day after."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

I wonder what it's about? Considering that there's time to spare, it doesn't seem to be an urgent matter... well, I'll find out when I go.

<b>

Since it's late at night, the surroundings are very quiet. If neither of us speaks, the sound of rustling trees and the chirping of insects can be heard clearly.

Sera's figure, illuminated by the moonlight, looks like a work of art.

<b>

She is staring at me intently.

Is she waiting for me to say something?

Or does she want to say something?

<b>

I don't know.

<b>

"Are you going to dive into the dungeon again starting tomorrow, Sera?"

<b>

For now, I tried to start a conversation that seemed harmless.

Then she replied normally, neither glaring nor ignoring me.

<b>

"Well... Tomorrow, I think I'll visit a friend for the first time in a while. After that, I'll probably go back to the dungeon."

<b>

Visiting a friend.

I could easily guess who that person was.

<b>

The daughter of a count.

The words I shouted at the guild receptionist, 'I don't have time.'

And Sera had also mentioned wanting to go to a B-rank dungeon.

<b>

With this information, anyone who knows the circumstances would inevitably realize.

The person she is visiting is the first princess of this country, Lady Fenon.

<b>

If Sera knew that I was aware of the princess's situation and was acting on it, what would she do?

<b>

Somehow, I feel like she would say something like, "Let me go with you."

As someone who struggles with party combat, I would prefer to avoid that since it would likely be a close match as it is. If I'm allowed to use her, then that's a different story.

<b>

"... I see. It seems you are aiming to conquer the B-rank dungeon, Sera, but it would be wise to avoid reckless dungeon exploration for your own sake."

<b>

"Your actions seem much more reckless, though."

<b>

"No, no, I am a cautious person, despite how it looks. I believe I understand my own abilities properly."

<b>

Sera didn't particularly argue with my words and simply replied, "I see," shortly. She might be thinking about something else in her mind.

<b>

Hmm. She really is precarious.

<b>

At this rate, not only will she not conquer the B-rank dungeon, but she might also charge into a C-rank dungeon alone and lose her life. It seems I won't be able to just turn a blind eye to that.

<b>

... It can't be helped. It may be a thin hope for her, like a spider's thread, but I'll make one suggestion. If all goes well, it might slightly increase my chances of conquering the B-rank dungeon.

<b>

I raised my index finger and said to Sera.

<b>

"Trust what I say."

<b>

She tilted her head with a puzzled expression, but I continued without caring.

<b>

"Don't betray me."

<b>

This time, I raised my middle finger and formed a peace sign.

<b>

"What on earth are you talking about? What have you been saying since earlier?"

<b>

Finally, I raised my ring finger.

<b>

"I will never do anything dangerous."

<b>

She looked at me with a bewildered expression.

<b>

"If you can keep these three promises, I will teach you how to become stronger."

<b>

Upon hearing those words, she didn't respond with any words. Instead, her Adam's apple moved up and down. Surely, over the past ten days, she has acknowledged my strength to some extent.

<b>

"If you are willing, Sera, please come to the guild at 8 AM the day after tomorrow. I will also head to the guild that day."

<b>

"... Understood. I'll think about it."

<b>

And then, silence again.

<b>

"Are you going to the dungeon again from the morning tomorrow, SR?"

<b>

This time, Sera initiated the conversation.

<b>

"Yes. Starting tomorrow, I plan to level up my advanced class in the C-rank dungeon."

<b>

Technically, it's a derived secondary class.

<b>

Upon hearing that, she widened her eyes a bit and let out a sigh as if exasperated.

<b>

"I see. If it's you, SR, you might actually be able to conquer the C-rank dungeon."

<b>

"Who knows?"

<b>

Of course, I intend to conquer it. I won't say anything unnecessary. If she starts talking about talent again, it might reignite a fight. I don't think such words would come from her now, but just in case.

<b>

Well then. It's late, and the conversation has run its course, so I should wrap things up.

<b>

"Well then, let's meet again if we have the chance."

<b>

"Ah. Thank you for the past ten days."

<b>

"That's my line."

<b>

"--- Hehe. That's true."

<b>

Sera gave me a slight smile at the very end.

<b>

<b>

☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆

<b>

<b>

The next morning, I arrived at the C-rank dungeon in the south of the royal capital, just as I had declared to Sera. As the dungeon rank increases, the number of explorers visibly decreases. It must be a difficult dungeon for them.

Yet, the number of gazes directed at me has increased. They are curious looks. Of course, I ignore them.

<b>

Right now, I have five options for secondary classes. There are two options for derived secondary classes.

<b>

A regular secondary class can be obtained by leveling one primary class to the required level, like a swordsman.

<b>

So, what is a derived secondary class?

<b>

This is a profession that can be obtained by leveling two primary classes to the required level of 30. The types are as follows.

<b>

<b>

A martial swordsman from a swordsman and a brawler.

<b>

A sage from a magic user and a priest.

<b>

A barrier mage from a knight and a priest.

<b>

A magic archer from an archer and a magic user.

<b>

<b>

Derived secondary classes do not change in status compared to regular secondary classes, nor does the level cap of 80 change. So why is the difficulty of changing classes higher than that of regular secondary classes? The reason lies in the skills.

<b>

For a secondary class like a swordsman, only the swordsman's skills can be inherited, but for the derived secondary class of martial swordsman, both the swordsman's and the brawler's skills can be used.

<b>

"For now, I guess I'll go with martial swordsman."

<b>

I secretly changed to the derived secondary class in a place away from the eyes of others, a little distance from the C-rank dungeon's reception. In the skill section, I properly have the 'Presence Detection' skill learned from the swordsman and the 'Evasion' skill learned from the brawler.

<b>

The Evasion skill allows me to reduce the time lag from when I see the enemy's attack to when I start dodging. For someone like me who specializes in evasion, it's like giving a demon a metal bat. I shouldn't be saying this myself.

<b>

I think about the player bonus I gained from the five primary classes and the status of the derived secondary class in my mind.

<b>

<b>

☆ Status ☆

<b>

Name: SR

Age: 18

Profession: Martial Swordsman

Level: 1

STR: E

VIT: F

AGI: E

DEX: F

INT: G

MND: F

Skills: Presence Detection, Evasion

<b>

<b>

I'm still at level 1, but the G category should be almost gone from the status. And I have already confirmed that the player bonus is functioning properly over the past ten days. The existence of the player bonus has turned into certainty for me.

<b>

Even so, my status is still insufficient to challenge the C-rank dungeon, but my combat experience that I have cultivated should make up for it.

<b>

There are at most 20 days left until the princess's life deadline.

<b>

I want to save the princess—my feelings haven't changed.

However, in addition to that, I now have one more motivation to aim for the B-rank dungeon.

<b>

<b>

Hot-tempered, a bit scary when glaring, and ears turning red when embarrassed, I hope that my caring friend won't have to be sad.

<b>

<b>

"Let's do our best."

<b>

I slapped my cheeks with both hands.

Whipping my tired body, I headed toward the C-rank dungeon.
