# A-76 Before the Match

<b>

<b>

"In other words, that girl over there was in the world where Esuar was—there's no mistake about it, right? Lady Idea also said something like 'child of my world.'"

<b>

As I conveyed the situation to the four members while keeping a bit of distance from Crescent, they all showed strained expressions. By the way, Crescent was testing her skills against the wall. Since she was using the Breaking Blade, her class is still the Sword Saint as usual.

<b>

"You don't need to be that nervous. It's not like we're going to kill each other."

<b>

In fact, it seems that Lady Idea will ensure no one gets hurt, and for this match, the risk of Shin and the others dying is non-existent. It's truly a match that can be approached with a game-like mindset.

I tried to lighten the mood for the four who were about to start the match, but Laika interjected, "Then why was Esuar nervous when talking to that girl?"

<b>

"Well, that's... how should I put it... the downside of avoiding social interaction? Something like that. It wasn't a problem over there (at least in the game), but if you're suddenly summoned to another world, you can't help but interact with people, right?"

<b>

"So you received some harsh treatment as soon as you got here, huh?"

<b>

"That's about the gist of it."

<b>

Back then, there was a lot of fuss about whether Sera would accompany me as a guard or not... Well, that became the catalyst for us to be able to act together like this now. Life is unpredictable.

<b>

But that's beside the point.

<b>

"I confirmed with Crescent, but unlike my case, it seems she hasn't returned to level 1 and is at her original level. In other words, her stats are equivalent to mine now."

<b>

"Seriously...? Well, if it's the world you were in, I guess it's not that surprising."

<b>

"I would have preferred a Cyclops... haha."

<b>

Following Shin, who slumped his shoulders in disappointment, Sera looked down at an angle and let out a dry laugh.

Since Lady Idea said, "Fight," there probably isn't a way for us to escape from here. There's no sign of a window appearing, and although I haven't tried, I shouldn't be able to use emergency return either.

<b>

"Since Lady Idea called out, 'Inhabitants of Noah's world,' I probably won't be able to do anything this time, so, well, good luck! I'll be watching while eating the snacks I have in my inventory."

<b>

"Your smile is really annoying! Acting like it's none of your business!"

<b>

Well, it is none of my business. With the assurance that Lady Idea is watching over us, it's somewhat like a form of entertainment.

<b>

Oh, speaking of which, I almost forgot to convey an important piece of information to Shin and the others. It was so obvious that I completely overlooked saying it.

<b>

"She's the second strongest person after me in the original world. Not just her stats, but her skills are top-notch too."

<b>

"Is the strategy meeting over? We're ready anytime!"

<b>

Once the conversation reached a pause, Crescent called out from a distance. It seemed she had been observing us and waiting for the right moment to speak. I distanced myself from the ASR members and walked toward her.

<b>

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Crescent."

<b>

"Ahaha, I told you before, but since you're Esuar, you can be more confident, you know?"

"Well... ahaha..."

<b>

It's not that I'm unhappy about being praised, but when I'm in front of her, the version of myself from the game days is pulled out from the depths of my heart. Crescent seems to be living in this world, so I need to adapt quickly. I don't want to show a pathetic side in front of Sera and the others.

<b>

Well, I'm not completely socially awkward, so I want to believe that I'll be fine once I get used to it.

<b>

"Oh, and Crescent, about this world—"

<b>

I started to explain to her that "this place resembles a game but is reality." There is bleeding, and pain is no different from reality. People die, and there is no resurrection. This time, thanks to Lady Idea's arrangements, there is no danger, but this state won't last forever.

<b>

After finishing my explanation, Crescent looked serious and said, "Well, that makes sense," as she turned her gaze to the sword she held.

<b>

In the game, I only thought about how much damage it dealt, how it could be reused, and what effects were attached, but what we are holding now is undoubtedly "a tool for killing living beings."

<b>

Among those "living beings," of course, humans are included.

<b>

"Somehow, looking at this sword, it doesn't seem that dangerous, does it? I might be more scared if a kitchen knife was pointed at me."

"Hahaha, I can understand that."

<b>

Is it a difference in reality? Or a difference in the sense of the world?

<b>

"If you'd like, you can use a wooden sword for this match. I have about five of them, so I'll lend you one."

<b>

"But wouldn't that mean I'd be the one getting killed instead? The opponent has regular weapons, right?"

<b>

"Lady Idea will take care of that. Besides, they are still at the stage of just starting to touch third jobs, not even capped yet, right? In terms of skills, it's like two at three digits and two at four digits."

<b>

By the way, the talk about three digits and four digits refers to individual rankings in Tempest. For someone who was at the top, it must feel like Sera and the others are still at a beginner level.

<b>

"Oh, then it seems fine. I'll gratefully accept the sword. Since I might hesitate to attack, I'll use this until I get used to it."

<b>

Saying that, she dramatically knelt in front of me, bowed her head, and extended both hands forward. With a wry smile, I placed the wooden sword in her hands, and she murmured in a tone that seemed to add "gozaru" at the end, "Thank you for this blessing."

<b>

I kind of want to see her reaction when she meets a real noble.
