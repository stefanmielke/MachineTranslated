# A-127 In the Cave

<b>

<b>

<b>

A dungeon-like place called a cave discovered in a new world known as a dungeon.

Yeah, even I don't quite understand what I'm saying. In any case, we found a cave in the dungeon that Lady Idea newly created.

<b>

It's dimly lit, and voices echo; if you listen closely, you can faintly hear what seems to be footsteps coming from the darkness ahead. It's hard to believe there are people here, so it's highly likely that monsters inhabit this place.

<b>

Currently, Hisui is acting as our light source, but it might be better to bring something like an oil lamp next time. With a lamp, we can place it on the ground and fight, but if we rely on magic to maintain visibility, our actions will inevitably be restricted.

<b>

Well, I don't intend to turn back just because of that.

<b>

"Aside from the lack of light, this dungeon seems like it could be anywhere."

<b>

"That's true~. Oh, isn't that the first monster? Detecting presence is easy in situations like this~."

<b>

"Not like it's a first villager or anything... Is it a goblin?"

<b>

"It is a goblin... and it's got a cool weapon."

<b>

As we walked through the cave, we spotted three figures that appeared to be children ahead, but they turned out to be goblins. We had sensed the presence of monsters, but they were surprisingly underwhelming. They were about 110 centimeters tall—common monsters that appear in other low-rank dungeons—but all three were equipped with large Western swords and round metal shields.

<b>

I guess it's a bit silly to wonder where they got such weapons.

<b>

"I'd prefer if goblins carried clubs like goblins should."

<b>

Crescent shrugged as if exasperated. The goblins seemed to have noticed us before we recognized their figures and appeared ready for combat.

<b>

"That was obvious."

<b>

"Well, we have the light on. It's only natural they noticed us. It's true that we have an advantage because of our skills, though."

<b>

While Hisui held the light in her left hand, she gripped a white lotus in her right. I also took out a white lotus from my inventory, just like her.

<b>

"There are three of them, so should we each take one? They don't seem like regular goblins, so they might put up a bit of a fight."

<b>

"Eh, I wanted to take on all three~."

<b>

"Don't be selfish. Both me and Esuar are holding back."

<b>

Everyone seems too eager to fight. Not that I can say anything about it.

I lit the light in my left hand and jumped over a small stream about two meters wide to the other side. One of the goblins jumped over to our side in response to my movement.

<b>

With its agile movements, it was clear that this was no ordinary goblin.

<b>

"Alright, I'll leave that to you~. If you get in a pinch, just call for help~."

<b>

As I teased them, both of them replied, "Please call out if Esuar-san gets in trouble too (okay?)". They seemed quite relaxed in front of the monsters.

<b>

However, that composure quickly vanished.

The distance to the monsters was about fifteen meters—within that distance, the goblin closed the gap in an instant.

<b>

"---Whoa, that's fast!? This guy's quick!"

<b>

I blocked a downward strike with the white lotus and pushed back to create some distance.

<b>

This might be the fastest monster I've seen so far. Sure, compared to Venom's beam-like attack, it's slow, but in terms of physical movement, it's definitely top-tier. Its strength is considerable, and without a proper status bonus, it seems like a heavy burden for Sera and the others.

<b>

I didn't expect a mere goblin, not a Goblin King or Goblin Lord, to be this strong, so I was quite surprised.

<b>

"Uh, uh, uh? Maybe facing three at once with one hand was a bit risky? I won't lose, but it would be scary if I got ambushed."

<b>

"And it's using proper swordsmanship~. It feels knight-like?"

<b>

While keeping the goblin in my sight and being cautious, I glanced towards Hisui and the others, who had already begun their battle. They seemed somewhat surprised, but their expressions were relaxed.

<b>

After exchanging blows with the goblin a few times, I entered a phase of testing how much it could actually do. Sometimes it would deliver a heavy strike, and other times it would try to overwhelm us with numbers, hiding behind its shield to make its next move unpredictable.

<b>

Well, in the end, it's just a monster. Compared to when I was facing a Tempest Lancer, this feels like child's play.

<b>

If ten of them rushed at once, I might get grazed by one of their attacks.

After enjoying the battle with the goblin, I decapitated it. Then, I turned my gaze towards Crescent and the others, who were still in combat.

<b>

"Ah, oh no!"

<b>

Crescent had been hit by a goblin's attack.

It seemed she had been hit by a thrown shield, and in the confusion of that unexpected action, she had been slashed on the arm. However, as expected of the leader of a top-ranking team and a professional gamer.

<b>

"Wow! Mika, that's lame! Unlike me, you have both hands free and you're getting attacked by a goblin!"

<b>

"That's not true! It just grazed my clothes! I didn't take any damage!"

<b>

"That's such a childish way to put it."

<b>

I think it's mutual? Hisui's way of speaking was pretty childish too.

<b>

"Enough already! Let's just take them down quickly!"

<b>

Crescent said with a sulky tone as she sliced into the goblin's body. Hisui had also finished off her goblin almost simultaneously. I was surprised, but in the end, everyone cleared the battle without taking any damage. Crescent's clothes had only been lightly cut.

<b>

That was quite an interesting enemy, and perhaps we can expect more from the monsters that appear in this cave.

After all, even the goblin that appeared first was like this. It would be only natural for even stronger enemies to show up from here on out.
