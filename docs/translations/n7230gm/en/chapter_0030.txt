# 29 Things I Want to Do

<b>

<b>

<b>

Lord Dino arrived in the room with a maid pushing a cart, and the first thing that happened was the exchange of money. Each of the five received a pouch filled with gold coins and signed for their receipt.

<b>

And next, the titles.

<b>

I thought we would receive something like a certificate of commendation, but contrary to my expectations, what Lord Dino handed over was a silver bracelet.

<b>

It was intricately decorated, with turquoise gemstones embedded in the bracelets of the Thunderbolt Trails, while mine had a red gemstone.

He explained the names of those gemstones in detail, but they were unfamiliar to me, and I quickly forgot them. I'm not good with foreign words.

<b>

The Thunderbolt Trails immediately put theirs on, so I followed suit and slipped my hand through the bracelet. I would take it off as soon as we left the royal castle. It was bothersome.

<b>

Serra, who was left out, watched us and said things like, "That's great!" and "That's amazing!" but her face clearly showed she was sulking.

Perhaps Lord Dino was considerate of her feelings, as he quickly wrapped up the topic of titles and changed the subject. I want to learn that kind of judgment.

<b>

"Now, shall we discuss the dungeon's攻略?"

<b>

Finally, it has come.

<b>

Lord Dino exchanged glances, and the maid who had been waiting in the room stepped out.

He maintained a calm expression throughout the conversation, but I had no idea what would happen from here on.

<b>

In the first place, I didn't know much about this person.

<b>

Is he a compassionate person, a cold-hearted one, a calculating person, or an aggressive one...? Since I had little interaction with him, there was too little information to imagine.

<b>

According to Shin and Serra, he is not inflexible and is relatively adaptable. It seemed that Shin's approval of my strategy was because he was dealing with the Prime Minister.

<b>

"Lord Dino. We would prefer not to discuss the攻略."

<b>

Shin immediately made that statement to Lord Dino.

Starting off with such a bold statement... or rather, is that how you should speak? What happened to the honorifics?

<b>

"…Hmm. So, does that mean you have done something special that others cannot know about? I believe it would not be beneficial for the kingdom if you were to monopolize that information. …Also, while it's fine here, please use proper language outside, as there are eyes around."

<b>

Shin was indeed scolded.

Raika, sitting next to him, gave his knee a light slap, followed by Suzu giving him a firm pat on the back. He bowed his head and said, "I'm sorry."

<b>

"I will be careful—. Now, as for the continuation of the conversation—"

<b>

"You can speak in your usual manner. However, let's practice so that you can switch depending on the situation."

<b>

"Yes... thank you very much."

<b>

"Very well. Now, let's hear the continuation."

<b>

With Lord Dino's words, the atmosphere was reset.

Shin straightened his back and began to speak while looking directly at Lord Dino.

<b>

"We did something special to conquer the B-rank dungeon, as Lord Dino mentioned. I don't intend to go into details, but I can provide a general overview."

<b>

"Does that relate to the fact that Lord SR and you were leveling up your lower-class jobs?"

<b>

"You knew that, huh?"

<b>

When Shin said that, Lord Dino responded with a look that seemed to say he was exasperated.

<b>

"Of course. You were the only party with the potential to save the princess, so it is only natural to pay attention to you."

<b>

As for me, it seemed Regulus had consulted with Lord Dino about me.

<b>

"…The information we hold is— a new job."

<b>

"—What!? Is that true!?"

<b>

Lord Dino placed his hands on the table and stood up energetically. He quickly sat back down on the sofa while saying, "I apologize," but his expression showed excitement.

<b>

"Ah, there are four of them— in exchange for this information, I would like you to accept two conditions."

<b>

Shin held up two fingers as he spoke. Lord Dino gulped.

<b>

"…May I hear the conditions first?"

<b>

"Of course. The first condition is that the discoverer of the new job is publicly announced as the Thunderbolt Trails by the kingdom."

<b>

"…Hmm. That is certainly your right. I would arrange it that way without needing to ask. Now, what is the second condition?"

<b>

"The second condition is that you will not pursue this dungeon攻略 any further in the future... that is the condition."

<b>

When Shin said that, Lord Dino looked taken aback, his mouth agape in surprise. The conditions were likely easier than he had imagined.

<b>

"…Is that all?"

<b>

"Yes. If you can adhere to these two conditions, I will discuss the new job with you."

<b>

Upon hearing that, Lord Dino rested his chin on his hand and quietly closed his eyes for a moment.

He was probably in his mid-forties. He had a handsome face and held a responsible position as Prime Minister. I thought he might be liked by women who prefer older men— I evaluated him in my mind.

<b>

"…Understood. I have been entrusted with this matter by His Majesty. I will accept the conditions."

<b>

After about a minute of thought, he spoke the words of agreement.

<b>

Alright!

With this, my plan of "Let's draw attention to the Thunderbolt Trails so that I don't stand out!" can be realized. Please don't mention my naming sense.

<b>

This was precisely what I had proposed as a condition for giving advice and training to the Thunderbolt Trails.

<b>

I wanted them to become the discoverers of the derived secondary jobs and gather public attention. Fortunately, they were already prominent as the kingdom's top party, so they gladly agreed, thinking there wouldn't be much change.

<b>

Furthermore, since the derived secondary jobs are stronger than other secondary jobs, it would mislead the public into thinking, "The conquest of the B-rank dungeon was thanks to that job."

<b>

However, there was one flaw in this plan.

<b>

Even if I could deceive the public, some people who knew the circumstances would realize, "That's strange."

<b>

After Shin finished explaining the method of obtaining the new job to Lord Dino, his gaze shifted from Shin to me.

<b>

"Is that so…"

<b>

Please don't look at me. If you're going to talk, please face Shin.

<b>

"I found it strange. The Thunderbolt Trails are indeed a strong party, but they did not have the capability to conquer a B-rank dungeon. Even if they had switched to a new job, given the reports, they wouldn't have had the time to level up. This means that someone other than them must have already reached that powerful job and accomplished the conquest of the B-rank dungeon."

<b>

He must have already reached a conviction in his mind. Continuing to feign ignorance would be meaningless.

<b>

Of course, Lord Dino would figure it out.

<b>

After all, the method to switch to a derived secondary job involves leveling up various lower-class jobs, and I had executed that before the Thunderbolt Trails.

Moreover, the Thunderbolt Trails began leveling up their lower-class jobs shortly after I discussed it with the guild.

There was no way Lord Dino, who was keeping an eye on their movements, wouldn't know that.

<b>

I steeled myself and decided to join the conversation.

<b>

"The discoverers are indeed the Thunderbolt Trails. You will keep your promise, right?"

<b>

"…Yes. That means it must have been a bother for Lord SR to receive the title as well. However, this is also a request from a certain person. I hope you can understand."

<b>

It seemed that Lord Dino understood that I did not wish to stand out in this charade. He said that apologetically.

<b>

Still, I wonder who this "certain person" is?

<b>

Since he went out of his way to conceal the name, he probably wouldn't answer even if I asked him. I gave up and moved on with the conversation.

<b>

"That's fine. Instead, please make sure to spread the derived advanced jobs properly. Don't think of monopolizing it in this country; make sure it is well disseminated to other countries as well."

<b>

Lord Dino nodded clearly at my words.

<b>

"Of course. After all, explorers have no borders, so it would be difficult to hide it even if we wanted to. However, is that alright with you, Lord SR? It seems you have no benefits from this."

<b>

"I'm not really thinking about gaining anything... Well, if I had to say, there is something I want to do."

<b>

"Oh? What is that? If it’s not too much trouble, I would like to know."

<b>

At Lord Dino's inquiry, I raised the corners of my mouth.

<b>

Since coming to this world, I had been running around to save the princess's life, but even amidst those hectic days, I had been thinking all along.

<b>

Why was I reincarnated into this world?

<b>

What is the intention of the one who reincarnated me— whether it be a god or whatever?

<b>

And how do I want to live in this world?

<b>

I simply thought about what I wanted to do. And I found it.

<b>

"I wish for the overall level-up of this world. Let's make the value of elixirs plummet."

<b>

Just as I helped the princess, I want to save people from illness and injury.

<b>

While that is part of it, the main reason I desire this is, "Please don't rely on me."

After all, I am from another world, so I want the people of this world to manage things on their own. I don't want to bear troublesome responsibilities. I want to live freely.

<b>

For that reason, I need Shin and the others to work in a way that befits the name of pioneers.
