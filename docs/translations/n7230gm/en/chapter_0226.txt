# A-109 The Love Patterns of Thunderbolt's Trajectory

<b>

<b>

<b>

About Shin's love patterns.

<b>

I tried to probe him, but his guard was firmer than I expected, and he didn't open up easily. The only information I managed to gather was that he seems to be relatively positive about the idea of marrying Suzu and Laika—that's all. Quite vague.

<b>

While keeping an eye on Suzu and Laika, who seem to be learning "gracefulness" from Phenon, I was talking to Shin, but it seems their conversation has ended, so I quickly started to move.

<b>

I told Shin, "Well, I'm going to talk to them over there," and wrapped up our conversation, but it seemed he figured out what I was heading over to do and followed me with a dissatisfied look.

<b>

"You don't have to come with me, you know?"

<b>

"I'm here to make sure you don't say anything weird!"

<b>

"Weird? Like what?"

<b>

"Uh, well, you know, about the two of them, like that."

<b>

Are you drunk? Or are you in your late twenties and going through puberty? Well, I can't really criticize, but since I'm already married, I can afford to be a bit more assertive.

<b>

Leading the mumbling and unclear Shin, I headed over to Laika and the others. Well, it's not like I forced Shin to come along; he just tagged along on his own.

<b>

When they saw me approaching, they waved with smiles. Then, upon seeing the party members, they looked puzzled.

<b>

"Shin seems a bit down, what's wrong?"

<b>

"Have you already gotten drunk? How pathetic."

<b>

"That's not it."

<b>

Shin answered bluntly, and the two tilted their heads. Then they looked at me as if seeking an answer. Well, I’m not the kind of guy who would just spill everything here.

<b>

"More importantly, what were you two talking about with Phenon?"

<b>

I asked, concealing that I had heard the details from Shin.

They then said something similar to what Shin had just mentioned. It seems they weren't hiding it after all.

<b>

"Well, we're at an age where it's about time, so I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to settle down."

<b>

"Exactly. Esuar should tell that idiot over there to 'get married already.'"

<b>

Hmm. It seems the two are indeed positive about getting married. Whether their focus is on Shin is uncertain, but it's not like they have completely disregarded him.

<b>

For now, I followed Suzu's words and said, "You should get married soon."

<b>

"You traitor..."

<b>

"When did I betray you? I always wish for your happiness, Shin."

<b>

"Which mouth are you saying that with?!"

<b>

Shin raised his voice at my words but soon slumped his shoulders in defeat. It seems he understands well that he is in a disadvantageous position. Yes, yes, analyzing the situation is basic.

<b>

"Have you two found someone good?"

<b>

I asked to probe further, and both of them looked blankly at me, while Shin's expression turned bitter.

<b>

"That chicken over there."

<b>

"We've known each other for so long; doesn't he understand us better than anyone else?"

<b>

The two readily acknowledged that the other was Shin. So why aren't they together...? Could it be that Shin is the one rejecting it?

<b>

"Well, I mean... how many years do you think we've been together? Doesn't it feel a bit too late? We may not be siblings, but it feels like that."

<b>

"Are you still saying that?"

<b>

"Just give up already."

<b>

Aren't the women a bit too strong? The leader of Thunderbolt's Trajectory is flustered.

<b>

I looked at Shin being cornered by Laika and Suzu. However, it didn't seem like he genuinely disliked it... If it's just pure embarrassment, I might just laugh at him.

<b>

"Shin doesn't have any complaints about Laika and Suzu, right?"

<b>

"Well, that's true..."

<b>

"Laika and Suzu are suddenly pushing for 'marriage,' so he's probably feeling anxious. I think it would be better to start as a couple first."

<b>

It might be a cliché opinion, but I'm not exactly an expert in romance either, so this is about my limit.

After hearing my words, Laika and Suzu turned their eyes toward me. It didn't feel like they were saying, "Oh, well," but rather had a look that seemed to ask, "Why?"

<b>

"This idiot has already made a move on us."

<b>

"Exactly. Even if it was in a drunken state. Considering that, aren't we already like a couple?"

<b>

At the voices of the two women, Shin awkwardly averted his gaze.

What do you mean "it's not a relationship to talk about love"? What do you mean "siblings"? Don't mess with me.

<b>

I gently placed my hand on Shin's shoulder and squeezed it tightly.

<b>

"It hurts, it hurts, it hurts! Don't crush me!"

<b>

"Ultimately, I want to respect Shin's opinion, but if the reasons for not being with them are 'it's too late' or 'it's embarrassing,' then just get together already. No one needs your embarrassment."

<b>

"What's with the way you're saying that?! And I'm telling you it hurts!"

<b>

Since Shin's eyes were starting to water, I released my grip. The world's top party leader is pathetic.

While Shin shot me a resentful glance and rubbed his shoulder, he glanced at the two women.

<b>

"Well, if you two really insist..."

<b>

Shin muttered that quietly, and the two nodded in satisfaction. No, no, this isn't good, is it?

<b>

"Make sure to express your feelings properly. Being so passive won't get you anywhere."

<b>

I suppose I'm usually the one who should be on the receiving end of such lines. But I'm already married.

But then again, there's the matter of Shiri and Noah... well, let's put my own situation aside for now.

<b>

After finally telling Shin to "do your best," I left the scene, but later Laika and Suzu came to thank me, so I guess I wasn't wrong.

<b>

Shin will probably say something once he calms down a bit more.
