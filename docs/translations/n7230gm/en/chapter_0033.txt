# 31 Gunununu...

Chapter 2, Start!

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Walking for thirty minutes on the cobblestone path illuminated by streetlights, I finally arrived at my destination, my home.

<b>

"I'm home!"

<b>

I passed through the entrance and shouted into the house in a tone mixed with a sigh. There was no response, but I could certainly sense a presence. After all, the lights were on.

<b>

Recently, I've been feeling stressed out because I haven't been able to go to the dungeon as I wanted. I could say that leveling up is my reason for living in this world, yet why do I have to attend meetings like a company employee from the morning?

<b>

And this house is also a factor contributing to my stress.

<b>

The house I currently live in is ridiculously large. It’s absurdly big.

<b>

In terms of area, it’s probably ten times that of a typical single-family home, and the building itself is unnecessarily large. The number of rooms makes me wonder, "What purpose could this possibly serve?" I still don’t know how to use most of them.

I can see more than half of the rooms becoming storage spaces in the future.

<b>

"You seem quite tired."

<b>

When I reached the living room, Sera, dressed casually in shorts and a shirt, greeted me.

She was sitting on a bright red sofa that matched her hair color, elegantly crossing her legs. While trying not to look at her thighs, which shone even more under the room's light, I replied shortly, "Yeah."

On the glass coffee table in front of me, there was one teacup and a plate of cookies.

<b>

"Where's Fenon?"

<b>

Usually, Fenon would be sitting across from her, along with the maid, Shiri, but neither of them was in sight.

<b>

"They both went home. They said to say hello to Esuar."

<b>

"Ah... I see, they are a bit later than usual."

<b>

Checking the time from my status, it was already past 10 PM.

The darkness outside wasn't much different from the usual around 8 PM when I come home, so I hadn't noticed at all. It seems I ended up chatting longer than I thought.

<b>

<b>

About a month has passed since I conquered the dungeon.

<b>

Diving into dungeons, sleeping at inns, and then going back to the dungeon—my days, which were filled with death in various meanings, came to an end with the acquisition of elixirs, and my life dramatically changed.

<b>

First and foremost, my living situation.

<b>

I had prepaid for thirty days at an inn that prioritized efficiency over comfort, but before those thirty days were up, I ended up moving into this house.

<b>

Moreover, despite having obtained a large sum of 10 million or, the cost of this house was free. Rather than having bought it, I was ordered by His Majesty to live here.

<b>

The reason is Fenon.

<b>

About a month ago, she confessed to me, saying, "I’m in love with you," but it wasn't a request for an engagement right away. Apparently, she intends to spend a lot of time together to win my heart.

<b>

I wonder why she is so infatuated with me... If it's because I'm her lifesaver, I think Shin would suffice as well—women's hearts are mysterious. Did she hold back because of Suzu and Raika, who are acting together with him?

<b>

And due to that reason of "spending a lot of time together," I ended up living in this huge building within the royal castle grounds.

If the royal castle is a house, then my residence is the size of a doghouse.

<b>

It would have been nice if His Majesty had gone mad and declared, "I won't let my daughter have you!" but unfortunately, it seems rather that His Majesty is positively considering it, leaving me with no escape route. How did it come to this?

<b>

There's no way I could say to His Majesty, "I'm not interested in the princess at all!" and I also don't have zero interest in her, which makes it even more hopeless.

<b>

I do return to the royal castle to sleep, but other than that, I'm staying in this house with the maid, Shiri.

<b>

In this lifestyle, what really bothers me is her calling me "Hero-sama."

<b>

In exchange for stopping her from calling me "Hero," I was forbidden from calling her with "sama." So, I usually call her "Fenon-san."

<b>

"How's the preparation going? Is it looking good?"

<b>

"Well... it should definitely be better than now."

<b>

I plopped down on the sofa opposite Sera and sighed towards the ceiling.

<b>

Recently, I've been practically cooped up in a private room at the Explorer's Guild. While I do dive into dungeons for a breather, it feels more like stress relief than fun. All of this is because of that hag—no, the Guild Master.

<b>

"Regulus should just think for himself since he was given the knowledge."

<b>

"That just means he relies on Esuar a lot. Being relied on by the Guild Master of the royal capital is something most would be happy about."

<b>

"I don't want that; it's a hassle."

<b>

As I complained, she frowned and chuckled.

<b>

The reason I'm cooped up in the Explorer's Guild is that the current dungeon rules are being partially changed.

<b>

The announcement of the derived secondary occupations is just a week away—and with that, first occupations will also be able to enter dungeons other than F-rank.

I was summoned to create those detailed regulations.

<b>

For example, to dive into an E-rank dungeon as a first occupation—meaning a lower class—one must level up the lower class to 30, change jobs, and have a record of conquering a D-rank dungeon as an advanced occupation—that's how it goes.

Newbies losing in E-rank dungeons usually comes from a lack of combat experience.

<b>

There were also regulations based on levels, and I reviewed the rules for C-rank and B-rank dungeons with an eye on the future.

<b>

For someone like me, who prefers to move their body over using their head, this past month has been nothing short of a trial.

<b>

But finally, today it ends. The new rules are complete.

I think I'll take a nice long bath and go to bed early today.

<b>

I wanted Sera to go home, take care of her business, and dive into bed, but for some reason, she showed no sign of wanting to leave. She was casually reaching for the cookies.

<b>

Since it felt awkward to tell her to go home, I shifted the conversation.

<b>

"So, how's it going? How much has Fenon grown?"

<b>

Sera is currently helping Fenon level up.

<b>

It seems the princess has a more tomboyish personality than I thought, and to spend more time with me, she started saying she would become an explorer herself.

<b>

Of course, everyone, including His Majesty, opposed it, but she didn’t change her mind and forcefully pushed her opinion through. Perhaps everyone has become a bit lenient towards her since she was on the brink of life and death.

<b>

"I've raised all lower classes except for swordsman to 30. If I have six more days, swordsman will reach 30 too."

<b>

"Oh, that's great. At that pace, you must have been diving from morning till night, right? That must have been tough."

<b>

"Heh, it's better than practicing swings alone outside."

<b>

What she’s referring to is when she was guarding me.

<b>

"Haha, I feel bad about that. Was Fenon okay with it?"

<b>

"She was just cheering me on from behind... well, she was just talking, so it seemed like no problem."

<b>

"I see."

<b>

They seem to get along well, and just talking is probably enough. Plus, since Fenon had been bedridden due to illness, it might be just right for her rehabilitation.

<b>

Currently, they are leveling up in a D-rank dungeon.

<b>

With Sera's level, she should be fine solo, and a D-rank dungeon shouldn't pose any danger to Fenon. In that regard, Sera seems to be more nervous than I am.

<b>

...So, how long does Sera plan to stay?

<b>

"Hey, it's about time—" "Ah, speaking of which!"

<b>

As I was about to speak, Sera hurriedly interrupted me.

<b>

"Shiri seems to be a level 50 advanced class—Divine Archer. She looks quiet, but her skills are quite impressive."

<b>

Oh... that's certainly surprising.

Imagining that beautiful maid with a bow makes for quite a picture. If there were a painting of that, I wouldn't mind hanging it in my room.

<b>

"I'll consider having her join the party. She seemed worried about Fenon, and she’s already talked about bonuses by chance."

<b>

It seems Shiri waits outside while the two are diving into the dungeon, just like Sera did once. The reason is that if she dives in too, the experience points would be split into three, hindering leveling up.

<b>

Is that really something to rush to talk about?

<b>

"It's getting late, so—" "I-I must be hungry! I'll make something!"

<b>

She interrupted me again. What does she want to do?

<b>

"I had skewers at a food stall on the way back and had a light meal at the guild, so I'm fine."

<b>

"Oh, I see..."

<b>

Sera said in a voice that seemed to fade away, lowering her gaze.

And in that gap, I finally succeeded in bringing up the main topic.

<b>

"I'll take you home, so you should go back today."

<b>

The elegant posture she had just moments ago was nowhere to be seen. She placed her fists on her knees and gripped them tightly. Her bitten lower lip had turned white. If this were a manga or anime, she would probably say "gununu."

<b>

"Gunununu..."

<b>

She actually said it! Like in a manga!

<b>

"Hey, what's wrong? Did something happen?"

<b>

I asked the strangely behaving Sera. Then, she slightly moved her lips. It seemed she was mumbling something, but I could only catch a faint "—kunai."

<b>

"Hm? What did you say?"

<b>

"—I don't want to."

<b>

"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."

<b>

Her voice became slightly louder, but I still couldn't hear. My eyesight is certainly good, but my hearing is just average.

As I tilted my head, she shot me a sharp glare.

<b>

<b>

"I said I don't want to go home tonight!"

<b>

<b>

Sera blushed, shouting with an expression that seemed to hold back her embarrassment.

<b>

...Huh? How did it come to this? Following Fenon, now Sera too?

<b>

My mind was filled with question marks and exclamation points, unable to form coherent thoughts. I could only stand there, dumbfounded.
