# A-77 Because she's my bride!

"Well then, I'll leave it to you! The outcome will be decided when one of us admits defeat—does that sound good?"

"That works for me. Let's leave the rest to the referee, Esuar."

<b>

Crescent and Shin are facing each other a short distance away, talking. Behind Shin are two party members and Sera, but it seems they are leaving the conversation to Shin.

I naturally ended up being the referee—well, I don't mind doing that. I'm just bored anyway.

<b>

This B-rank dungeon is a grassland type—originally, it's a dungeon with not many obstacles, so both sides have no choice but to confront each other head-on. In other words, it's a situation not much different from a PvP battle.

<b>

Sera looked at me with a worried expression, so I waved my hand and raised my voice.

<b>

"Give it your all! Challenge me as if you're fighting against me!"

<b>

"There's nothing but despair!"

<b>

Sera immediately reacted to my words. Well, it's kind of a losing event, so it can't be helped.

If Shin and the others manage to land an attack on Crescent, it will probably be within the first minute. After that, everything will be adapted—now, I wonder what kind of match this will turn out to be.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

At my shout of "Start!" Sera and Shin charged towards Crescent. They didn't just charge straight ahead; they approached diagonally in an X formation.

<b>

"Oh, it seems like Esuar was right; their stats haven't been raised yet."

<b>

As she said this, she took a big step back—then, with a strong push, she leaped over their heads in an instant. She then dashed towards where Laika and Suzu were like a rabbit fleeing.

<b>

"Now, what will you two do?"

<b>

Without paying any mind to Shin, who hurriedly returned, Crescent arrived at Laika and the others in an instant and called out to the two, who were flustered.

<b>

"We're scattering!"

<b>

"Understood!"

<b>

Although Crescent showed no signs of attacking, the two hesitated and spread out, wary of her incredible speed.

Crescent did not chase after the fleeing duo but slowly turned around.

<b>

"Stat-wise, it's not enough time. Well, I have a rough idea of your speed, so next, let's see your techniques."

<b>

Saying this, she began to bounce in place with a steady rhythm. Then, with a sound like a bang, her figure disappeared from the spot. Well, to be precise, she didn't disappear; she was just that fast.

<b>

She approached, moving left and right in large motions, playing with her enemies at a speed incomparable to Shin and the others.

<b>

It seems she not only inherited the stats but also kept her equipment. As usual, her AGI was raised to SSS by her rings and armor. Plus, with the 20% increase in AGI from "The Peak of Martial Arts," learned at level 100 as a Sword Saint, it's no wonder she's fast.

<b>

From my perspective as someone who participated in ranking battles as a Demon Lord, dealing with a Sword Saint with MAX AGI was a hassle. Those guys are just too fast. Well, I had the upper hand in firepower, though.

<b>

Faced with the swiftly moving Crescent, Sera and the others seemed at a loss as to how to act. However, she relentlessly closed in on Sera and launched a horizontal slash.

<b>

"—Guh!?"

<b>

Crescent slightly reduced the speed of her sword swing and attacked Sera's abdomen, but that attack was barely blocked by Sera's sword.

<b>

However, just because she blocked it doesn't mean she was unscathed; she was lightly sent flying due to the difference in power. Sera was physically larger, but she was blown away effortlessly. As expected of a game world.

Sera spun around and adjusted her posture in mid-air before landing next to Shin.

<b>

"Her reaction speed is not bad. It seems you're not very used to this kind of attack, are you?"

<b>

"I'm not just not used to it; this is my first time! It's truly incredible... the people from Esuar's world!"

<b>

"So it's your first time! That's impressive!"

<b>

"Hehe... you say that while intentionally slowing down to a speed I could handle."

<b>

"You could see that much!?"

<b>

It seems Crescent was genuinely surprised that her hand was seen through.

I could see it too! I understood it too!

While I was burning with rivalry against Sera in my heart, she seemed pleased to be praised and puffed out her chest with a smug expression.

<b>

"Fufufu—after all, I am Esuar's disciple—and—your bride!"

<b>

...What on earth is this girl suddenly saying?

<b>

"…Huh? Your bride?"

<b>

Suddenly starting a bride move, both Sera and I, as well as Shin, who was in the middle of the match, were left dumbfounded. Crescent looked at us with that expression, but I avoided her gaze and covered my face with my hands to darken my vision.

<b>

At least let's reverse the order of the introduction... It sounds like "bride" is more important than "disciple." Normally, that would be a nice thing to say, but considering we are currently in combat with an enemy, it is clearly wrong.

I never expected a mental attack to come at the referee.
