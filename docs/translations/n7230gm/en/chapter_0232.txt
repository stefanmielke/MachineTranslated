# A-115 The New Dungeon is...

<b>

<b>

<b>

Relying on the information brought to us by Regulus, we hurried to the site.

<b>

Of course, my father and mother stayed behind. I can't take them to a top-tier dungeon in their level 1 state. They wouldn't die, but still.

<b>

As Regulus had told us, it was located to the west of the royal capital—appearing along the road.

<b>

However, it felt more like a stage than a building, standing less than a meter tall. It seemed like there was a wide stone pavement spreading out in a circular shape after stepping up two levels.

<b>

Surrounding it, the knight order was lined up at equal intervals, seemingly on guard to prevent anyone else from entering carelessly.

<b>

"Excuse us for intruding."

<b>

I wondered if this greeting was appropriate as I entered the security area without any issues.

Accompanying me this time were ASR, Thunder's Track, and two members from Earth.

<b>

Thunder's Track, probably unable to enter since they haven't cleared an S-rank dungeon, came along to confirm that. They likely just wanted to see it up close as well.

<b>

"It feels like a larger version of a regular dungeon without decorations."

<b>

"Yeah. I like it simple."

<b>

As they said this, Crescent and Jade ascended the steps. The circular stone pavement seemed to have a diameter of about fifty meters, and the center, about twenty-five meters in diameter, emitted a faint glow. It looked bright even at night.

<b>

After that, the ASR members, including myself, stepped onto the stone pavement, and Thunder's Track was about to follow.

<b>

"—Whoa!?"

<b>

Shin was bounced back as if he had collided with a wall. It seemed he had charged in headfirst, crouching down while holding his forehead. With his high stats, it shouldn't hurt that much.

<b>

"I had a feeling that would happen."

<b>

"It was a good call to let Shin go first, Suz."

<b>

You guys... You do like Shin, right? You're planning to marry him, right?

Isn't it a bit cruel to send him in first to check for dangers? I felt a little sympathy as a fellow human. Tough luck.

<b>

"Probably, you need to be an S-rank conqueror to go any further. Unfortunately, it seems you all can only go this far—sorry for bringing you all the way here."

<b>

As I told the three after descending the two steps, they shook their heads with laughter.

<b>

"That was our intention from the start, so it's fine. We're planning to wander around the royal capital for the first time in a while."

<b>

"Yes, yes. We'll make sure to hear all about the inside later."

<b>

"Well, I'm looking forward to what kind of dungeon it is—but we have plenty of dungeons we haven't cleared yet. We'll tackle those first before we can confidently clear this one."

<b>

I feel like that depends on the difficulty of this dungeon.

<b>

Thunder's Track probably has enough money, and if they're just thinking about leveling, this non-lethal dungeon might be a viable option. The problem is whether there are monsters they can defeat.

<b>

"Eh? Is it okay to go in already?"

<b>

I turned back towards Regulus and asked, and he shrugged before nodding.

Sera, seeing the guild master with a troubled expression, smiled wryly and spoke to me.

<b>

"Does Esuar not feel any tension? It's your first time in a dungeon, right?"

<b>

Well, it is my first time. I know it's my first time and that the difficulty is high, but that's about it.

<b>

"Because you don't die here, right? What is there to be tense about... Ah, no, I do feel a tension of excitement, of course."

<b>

I have a vague wish of "I hope it's like this," but if I say it out loud and it turns out to be different, the disappointment would be immense, so I'll keep it to myself.

<b>

"I think it's good that you're being yourself, Esuar. Right, Shiri?"

<b>

"Indeed, that's really true."

<b>

While Pheno and the others made comments that spoiled me, Noah grinned and said, "As expected of a dungeon-loving person." Should I give you a head rub, you?

<b>

Just as I thought that, he ran away. Don't read my thoughts.

<b>

"Well, let's go ahead and check it out."

<b>

The flow from here was something I had decided on before arriving at this place.

<b>

Since only five people can enter the dungeon, we, being seven, decided to split into two groups. Though, it just meant splitting into the usual ASR members and the Earth group.

<b>

But before that, the four of us—Crescent, Jade, me, and Noah—planned to enter first, check the situation inside, and then return urgently.

<b>

"I hope there are challenging enemies. If there are no Venoms and we can't feel the thrill of a near-death battle, it would be really boring. I'm so grateful to Lady Idea!"

<b>

"I wouldn't say it's boring, but... I feel similarly."

<b>

"Same here."

<b>

After agreeing with the Earth group, we finally stepped into the transfer area.

We stepped in, but—

<b>

"Hm? Something feels off."

<b>

Normally, when we stop for a moment, a stone pillar for inserting the license card would rise from below, but there was none. Instead, particles of light floated up from the ground.

<b>

"Does that mean we don't need a license card? But then, how do we prove we've cleared an S-rank—ah, but we couldn't even get here in the first place."

<b>

"I see."

<b>

As we chatted in our usual tone, the scenery suddenly changed.

<b>

The view that had been in sight moments ago was unchanged. The stone pavement was underfoot, there were no people around, and while the detailed scenery was different, there were paths, plants, and faint mountains visible in the distance—

<b>

"—Haha... Lady Idea, this is amazing."

<b>

In a daze, I couldn't help but say that.

<b>

The mountains visible in the distance were not just scenery. I could see creatures resembling dragons flying around nearby. And that wasn't all.

<b>

I also saw other monsters, not dragons, flying around.

This was unprecedented in previous dungeons. Typically, there is one type of monster per floor. Exceptions are usually only for bosses.

<b>

In other words, this dungeon—no, this world is—

<b>

"An open world...!"
