# A-67 I Am Human

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing my business in the Kingdom of Palmoor, I was in a state where I could return home at any time, but due to Ms. Neska's request, we ended up having to fight against the party of the "Crimson Sword."

At first, the other members of ASR fought, but they were sunk in front of Noah's gravity magic. Then, the match began, with me alone against the five members of the "Crimson Sword."

<b>

Since Noah used a powerful magic that could kill in one hit, I thought I would try to make the match last longer... but now, what should I do?

<b>

"I'll create an opening! Neska, aim for that!"

<b>

"I understand—wait, isn't that impossible!? Although Lord Esuar looks full of openings, he can counterattack from anywhere!?"

<b>

"Just make it work somehow!"

<b>

"Can Kal even create an opening for Lord Esuar in the first place!?"

<b>

"Probably not!"

<b>

"Then why did you suggest that!?"

<b>

It seems that the man's name is Kal. I don't know if it's a nickname or his real name.

As the match progressed, the atmosphere shifted from a serious mood to a more relaxed one. At first, they approached me seriously, but now they were starting to devise strategies even with me right in front of them.

<b>

The reasons for this could be, first, that the weapon I'm using is a wooden sword, which poses little danger, and I haven't launched any attacks that could incapacitate them.

Second, I basically haven't attacked and have been in a defensive stance.

And lastly, this is just a guess, but I think they might be enjoying the fight against an opponent whose strength they can't match.

<b>

As I waited for the next attack, the man called Kal rested his sword on his shoulder and spoke to me with a sigh.

<b>

"Wow, but Lord Esuar, are you really human?"

<b>

"From any angle, I look human, right?"

<b>

How rude. Do I look like a monster?

Well, since I'm a reincarnated person from another world, it would be difficult to answer if asked if I'm just a human.

<b>

"Hahaha! That's true! So, as a fellow human, I also have the potential to become like you!"

<b>

"That's up to your efforts from now on."

<b>

It's all about the effort "from now on." Leveling up to a second job is one thing, but leveling up to a third job is tough. You need the determination to clear S-rank dungeons every day.

<b>

In response to my words, Kal rubbed his finger under his nose and muttered, "Sounds good." He seems quite motivated. I'm glad he's enjoying this world.

However, they have stopped attacking. It hasn't even been an hour yet, but have they already run out of steam?

<b>

—Perhaps my inner thoughts were showing on my face. Ms. Neska told me, "I'm thinking about how we can make you sweat."

I see. However, in this situation, making me sweat would be quite a high difficulty.

<b>

"That might be a bit difficult. Even though it's five against one, the number of times we've 'broken through' is vastly different between you and us. And more than anything, our experience in combat is different. It's not a world of 'thousands' but 'tens of thousands.'"

<b>

Moreover, I was fighting against ranked players who have done extensive research. There's no way they haven't seen strategies that come to mind in this situation.

<b>

"If it were someone else, I'd laugh and say 'impossible,' but after being beaten up like this, I can't tell if it's a bluff or the truth."

<b>

Kal said that with a mix of exasperation.

Indeed, at my current age, it does seem unnatural. If I were over thirty in my previous life, it might have had more persuasive power. Ah, what a blunder.

<b>

"Hahaha... well, what should we do? Should we continue?"

<b>

After awkwardly laughing it off, I turned to Ms. Neska and the others to ask.

Then they gathered in one place and began to whisper among themselves. It no longer felt like a match, but since there's nothing at stake and no audience besides us, they should be free to do as they please. The guild master acting as the referee looked exasperated.

<b>

"Then, could you please attack us, Lord Esuar? We're prepared for some minor injuries, so feel free to use your skills. We'll focus on defense."

<b>

After a minute or two had passed, Ms. Neska said that.

After fighting for nearly an hour without using a single skill, it seems she finally realized that I was holding back on using my skills. However, attacking—hmm.

<b>

"Sure. So, how should we go about it? Should I adjust it to be a training exercise?"

<b>

"Just go all out, Lord Esuar! Even if you use skills I don't know, I won't complain!"

<b>

Somehow, I had been called "Lord" without realizing it.

The term reminded me of Sera, so I glanced at where they were waiting, and I saw Sera glaring at Kal with an intense expression.

<b>

...Hey, hey, is she feeling competitive against a guy? How cute.

Well, putting that aside—since I was told to go all out, I'll switch to the Overlord class. Even though it's during a match, it's not like I can't change my class like in a dungeon.

<b>

After fiddling with the window, I switched from Sword Saint to Overlord.

Then, I called out to the "Crimson Sword," who had formed a tight formation with Ms. Neska at the front.

<b>

"Alright, here I go!"

<b>

"Yes! We're ready at any time!"

<b>

In stark contrast to just a moment ago, Ms. Neska had a very serious expression. Kal and the other members looked the same.

From the movements of Ms. Neska's eyes, I could tell they were probably predicting how I would move—but too bad. I'm already within range, so there's no need for me to move.

<b>

First, gravity magic.

<b>

"—Ugh, this skill again!? There must be an area of effect! Spread out—"

<b>

Then, Binding Arrow.

<b>

"Watch out! An arrow from above—Ughhh!"

<b>

"I can't escape—!"

<b>

And finally, the Destruction Blade—there.

In the real world, the Binding Arrow is quite painful, so I quickly released it. It feels like being tied up with thorny strings, so it can't possibly not hurt. The Destruction Blade only knocked away their weapons, so even if there was pain, it would only be in their wrists.

<b>

Ah, being able to use skills freely is truly wonderful. Speaking of which, the Cyclops in the B-rank dungeon had no way to counter this combo.

<b>

...Yeah.

<b>

For now, let's go heal them.
