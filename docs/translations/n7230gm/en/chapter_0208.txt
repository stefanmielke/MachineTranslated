# A-91 Kime Hisui

<b>

<b>

<b>

I’m worried about my parents, but above all, I’m concerned about Hime Ski.

<b>

When I first came to this world, I was so confused that I threw up right there, so I worry about Hime Ski’s mental state.

Well, unlike me back then, she has Crescent, who was in the party with her, so I think it’s somewhat better. However, I can’t really judge how she feels about coming to this world since I don’t know much about Hime Ski’s personality.

<b>

About an hour had passed when I asked the party members who were in my room to step out, and in their place, Crescent and Hime Ski came in.

<b>

“How are you? Have you calmed down a bit?”

<b>

Pushed in the back by Crescent, Hime Ski entered the room looking apprehensive. When I called out to her, she replied shortly with “Yes.”

<b>

“I asked Mika, but is it really not a game world?”

<b>

“Ah, I see, Hime-chan doesn’t trust herself, huh!”

<b>

“Because Mika sometimes jokes around.”

<b>

“I choose the time and place, you know!”

<b>

Crescent shouted in protest.

Speaking of which, Hime Ski called Crescent “Mika.” It feels nostalgic.

I had them sit side by side on the sofa, and I took a seat across from them at the table.

<b>

Now then… what should I start talking about?

Crescent has probably explained the situation to some extent, so I don’t think I have much new information to offer.

So,

<b>

“Do you have any questions? I’ll answer anything I know.”

<b>

I asked. After all, I don’t know what they want to know.

In response to my question, Crescent made a comical reaction as if she had stumbled.

Next to her, Hime Ski was giving Crescent a look that seemed to say, “You’re such an idiot.”

<b>

“What’s with that?”

<b>

“It’s not ‘what’s with that’! This is the moment where you say something like, ‘You must have been surprised by the suddenness; don’t worry. I’ll protect you!’”

<b>

“Eh… I’m not that kind of character. Besides, I haven’t said anything like that to you either.”

<b>

“Hime-chan is cute! She’s a delicate maiden!”

<b>

I don’t want to use the term “delicate maiden” toward a player ranked third in individual battles. That’s just deceptive.

While I was having a sort of argument with Crescent, I noticed Hime Ski was staring at me intently. Oh right, I had left the question hanging.

<b>

“Have you thought of anything you want to ask?”

<b>

“Why do you speak casually to Mika but use honorifics with me?”

<b>

…Well, I did say I’d answer anything, but I didn’t expect that kind of question.

<b>

“I’m young now, but when I was over there, I was in my early thirties. In the game, age didn’t matter, so I unified everything with honorifics. If you’d prefer a more casual tone, that’s fine too.”

<b>

I’ve gotten used to speaking casually after all.

<b>

“Then please do.”

<b>

“Feel free to be casual, Hime Ski.”

<b>

“Um… okay, I’ll do my best.”

<b>

After hearing my age, that might be difficult for her.

Crescent said she was twenty-four, and Hime Ski is her junior. Moreover, since she passed away before Crescent, her age is probably in her early twenties.

Compared to me, there’s at least a decade gap, so it would be tough for her to suddenly be told, “Let’s speak casually.”

<b>

“It seems you can’t think of many questions, so I’ll ask you one. — So, Hime Ski, are you glad to have been reborn in this world?”

<b>

That’s a fundamental question.

<b>

If she said she didn’t want to come to a world like this!

If she wanted to be allowed to sleep peacefully!

What on earth would I do then?

<b>

Would I have to ask Idea-sama, “Forget it. Please let Hime Ski ascend”? I want to leave everything to Crescent.

<b>

“I’m very happy about that. I was originally weak, but since coming here, I feel very light and have no discomfort anywhere. Also, Tempest was my favorite game, so my excitement is stronger than anything else.”

<b>

If possible, I’d like to tell my parents that I’m having fun. But Hime Ski concluded her words like that.

However, it seems she understands that it’s something she can’t do.

I heard that both of her parents are alive, and if I were to tell living people, “Your child is doing well in another world,” that would be a huge problem.

Rather, it could lead to her getting caught up in some strange religion, causing negative effects.

<b>

“T-That, and—Hime Ski is a bit embarrassing, so if you could call me Hisui…”

<b>

“Hmm? Is that your real name?”

<b>

“Yes, it’s Kime Hisui.”

<b>

Kime is quite a rare surname.

Kime Hisui, Kimehisui… Hime Ski…

<b>

“You both have such a straightforward naming, huh?”

<b>

“I don’t want to hear that from someone who uses initials like SR!”

<b>

That’s quite reasonable.
