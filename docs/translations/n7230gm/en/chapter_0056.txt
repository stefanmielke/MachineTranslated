# 54 Enemy of Women?

<b>

<b>

<b>

After the match between Sera and Rei ended, the arena was enveloped in excitement for a while.

Cheers praising Sera, shouting "Sword Saint! Sword Saint!" echoed even outside the arena.

<b>

According to what I heard from Shin, one of the members who conquered a B-rank dungeon long ago was given the title of "Sword Saint" by the king at that time. It seems the spectators view Sera as the reincarnation of that Sword Saint.

<b>

As for me, upon hearing the Sword Saint call... I was desperately holding back a grimace while quietly clapping my hands.

<b>

Because the title of Sword Saint... even if I were to receive it, ugh, I can easily imagine Sera getting depressed. I should think of a way to comfort her. Or maybe I should ask Fenon to ensure Sera doesn't receive the title of "Sword Saint."

<b>

In contrast to the excited audience, I let out a big sigh.

<b>

<b>

"Sera really has gotten strong..."

<b>

As the cheers began to settle down, Shin said, looking at the now-empty stage with admiration.

<b>

"Well, yeah. I don't know the technical aspects, but she's definitely gotten stronger."

<b>

"I know that. If she hadn't gotten stronger, we wouldn't have been able to conquer a B-rank dungeon with just the three of us— but it's only a matter of time before she surpasses me."

<b>

Shin said this with a hint of self-deprecation, and Suzuko gave him a slightly stronger pat on the back— or was it a punch? That sounded pretty heavy.

<b>

With a voice that sounded like air was forcibly pushed out of his lungs, Shin was lectured by Suzuko.

<b>

"As Sera-san grows, we just need to get stronger too. What kind of leader is so pessimistic?"

<b>

"I know that— but with Sera and Esuar around, there are so many strong people lately... I wonder if it's okay to still be called the number one party in the kingdom..."

<b>

"Don't compare yourself to Esuar. He's a monster."

<b>

"Exactly. He's an abnormal person, so worrying about him is just a waste of time. The same goes for the party he's in."

<b>

"Well, that's true."

<b>

"Hey, you there! What are you saying next to me? I can hear everything!"

<b>

When I said that, the three from Thunderbolt's Trail all quickly averted their eyes from me. You guys are in perfect sync!

<b>

After that, Shin, not looking particularly guilty, said, "Sorry, sorry," leaned back on the sofa, and looked up at the sky. I followed suit and looked up. It was a clear day— a blue sky with not a single cloud.

<b>

"We have a match after this... The audience's expectations are definitely rising."

<b>

"Exactly."

<b>

"We can't slack off..."

<b>

Well... that’s probably true.

Even though Sera has become somewhat known as an explorer, Shin and the others are overwhelmingly recognized for their strength. Anyone can see the respect that other explorers have for Thunderbolt's Trail.

<b>

There might be some who think Sera is an exceptionally strong explorer, but that is likely a minority.

Logically speaking, people would think Thunderbolt's Trail, with its name recognition, is stronger.

<b>

"Well, it'll work out somehow. And even if Shin and the others' strength disappoints the audience, it won't be a problem, right? It's not like we'll be exiled from the kingdom or anything."

<b>

"If we were unknown explorers, it wouldn't bother us."

<b>

"Being famous means bad rumors spread quickly too."

<b>

"Ah... that's certainly true."

<b>

It's a hassle to stand out because you have to think about unnecessary things like this.

I feel like I've already reached a point of no return, but I should try to maintain my stance of not standing out as much as possible.

I can only hope it’s not too late.

<b>

While having such a conversation with Thunderbolt's Trail, Sera returned after finishing her match.

Her expression was beaming with joy. She walked with a light step, as if she were skipping.

<b>

"Master! I won!"

<b>

First of all, she reported her victory to me.

I already knew that much since I watched the match.

<b>

"Yeah, congratulations— and the 'Master' thing is over now. Please go back to calling me by the previous name."

<b>

It was originally supposed to be "only inside the dungeon," but there's no need to point that out now. I had forgotten about it until now.

Besides, she would likely be very depressed later, so I should be as kind to her as possible for now.

<b>

"That's right— thank you for your guidance, Esuar. But I would be happy if you continue to teach me."

<b>

"Sure. I'll make you stronger and stronger."

<b>

"Count on it."

<b>

With a smile, Sera nodded and sat down next to me, letting out a sigh.

At that moment, Shin called out to her.

<b>

"You've gotten quite strong. Imagining you getting even stronger is terrifying."

<b>

"Well, if you guys receive Esuar's guidance, you'll get strong quickly too."

<b>

"I hope so... but it probably won't be as easy as it is for you."

<b>

Seeing Shin smile wryly, Sera tilted her head with a puzzled expression. Is it hard for geniuses to notice their own uniqueness?

<b>

"I received power from Esuar. The smoothness of the match was partly thanks to this."

<b>

As she said this, Sera caressed the ring on her left middle finger.

The gazes of Shin, who was talking, and Suzuko and Laika, who were listening nearby, all turned to her ring at once.

<b>

"...Huh? You guys were in that kind of relationship?"

<b>

"I don't really recommend romance within the party, but— congratulations."

<b>

"Tonight we have red rice."

<b>

Oh, so there’s red rice in this world— wait, that's not it!

<b>

"That's not it! I don't know what misunderstanding you have, but this is a very precious item!"

<b>

Since I was planning to tell Thunderbolt's Trail anyway, I spoke quickly about how to obtain this "Ring of Dexterity," its drop rate, and its effects. This is not to hide my embarrassment!

<b>

At first, the three of them had expressions as if they were listening to a love story, but as the conversation progressed, their expressions gradually became more serious. Confusion, surprise, exasperation— a swirl of various emotions was evident on their faces.

<b>

"You really got something outrageous... So that's the drop item in question."

<b>

"I didn't create it from scratch. It's a bonus, and the ring was originally in this world. You guys just didn't notice it."

<b>

"That's true, but... I'm not sure if I'm happy to know or if I wish I hadn't known..."

<b>

Shin, as if struggling with something, held his head.

Is he imagining the dawn of a new era that is about to arrive? This is just the beginning.

<b>

"If you'd like, why not try using this ring? It might improve your appearance in front of the audience a bit."

<b>

"What? Is there one besides the one Sera is wearing?"

<b>

"I'm planning to collect more, but for now, there's just this one."

<b>

Ultimately, I plan to collect a total of six, one for each status. Only God knows how long that will take. It's all about luck.

<b>

"So, you're talking about the one Sera is wearing...?"

<b>

"Huh? I'm telling you it is."

<b>

When I answered, the three from Thunderbolt's Trail looked at me with disappointed expressions, as if they were looking at something unfortunate. Especially the women had alarming expressions. That was the kind of look directed at the infamous G.

<b>

As for Sera, she was shaking her head vigorously as if a child were throwing a tantrum, hugging her left hand. It was a clear indication that she would not give up the ring.

<b>

Even though I wasn't planning to give it to Shin and the others and I could obtain the same one later, why was she so attached to that ring?

<b>

Possessiveness? I don't get it.

<b>

"...The ring is fine, but don't take it from Sera."

<b>

"No, I don't intend to take it—"

<b>

"Loaning it is also not allowed."

<b>

"If you gave it to Sera, then Esuar can't just decide to loan it out."

<b>

This ring is recognized as Sera's possession and at the same time, as the party's item... Of course, it wasn't the kind of atmosphere where I could argue that.

As I took a slight step back from the sharp demeanor of the women, I bumped into Sera sitting next to me. When I turned to apologize—

<b>

"This ring is mine..."

<b>

There was Sera, pouting with a sulky expression. Is she that unwilling to part with this ring?

<b>

"Alright, I get it... I won't ask to borrow it anymore, so cheer up."

<b>

"Um... I'll cheer up."

<b>

She looked like a child who was about to have a toy taken away. It's hard to believe she's 22.

<b>

Well, I actually like that part of her.
