<b>

I still have a mountain of questions I want to ask Noah, but for now, I've decided to start leveling up.

If I start asking, the conversation might get long, and it would be a waste of time. If I'm going to have a long talk, it’s better to do it when I'm physically tired.

<b>

"You don't have to worry about VIT. I'll replenish it gradually. You should rest when you feel mentally exhausted."

<b>

"…Is that so?"

<b>

It seems I don't get tired.

It would have been easier to understand if my body was breaking down, but mental fatigue is hard to judge on my own. I’ll trust that Noah will assess that for me.

If I break down, it would be a problem for him too, so he will surely treat me with care.

<b>

"Shall we start with the Sword Saint?"

<b>

The first third job I chose was the Sword Saint, which increases STR, AGI, and VIT with player bonuses.

No matter if it’s a magic class or whatever, in the end, I only engage in close combat, so I want to acquire this job's player bonuses as soon as possible.

<b>

Confirming that the skills of Swordsman, Brawler, Sword Master, Hero, and Martial Arts Swordsman are properly displayed in my status, I donned the black coffin I received from Noah and stepped outside the house.

<b>

As always, a creepy landscape spreads out. There’s so little here that the ruins seem to have more of a sense of life.

If my house gets destroyed, it would make Noah waste unnecessary energy, so I decided to keep a moderate distance and walk briskly. While moving forward, I asked Noah, who was floating behind me.

<b>

"Can you summon all the monsters that appear in Tempest?"

<b>

"That's right. I can create other monsters too, but can we stick to the ones you're familiar with this time? We can't afford any surprises, and it would be troublesome if that caused us to lose our pace."

<b>

I felt a bit excited hearing the first part, but it seems that's not allowed.

Trying to enjoy this situation is indeed inappropriate, and if I make a mistake, it wouldn't be funny. I should follow Noah's advice.

<b>

"Understood. For now, summon two Freezing Spiders and two Nine-Tails."

<b>

The Nine-Tails is a boss that appears in a different S-rank dungeon. In contrast to the cotton candy, it’s a fire-manipulating monster, and although it’s the smallest among the S-rank dungeon bosses at just over three meters tall, it moves quickly and frequently uses powerful magic.

That said, many players in Tempest could defeat a boss of this level alone.

<b>

"…Are you serious? You understand what I just said, right?"

<b>

Noah said with a strained expression.

I thought I had ordered a reasonable amount to avoid danger.

<b>

"Are you the one who's serious? You know I played Tempest, right? I’ve gone solo into party battles, so I'm used to fighting multiple opponents. If they’re weaker and outnumbered compared to players, I won’t lose."

<b>

If I only had the skill to lose to this level, I could never hope to defeat Venom. So this isn't arrogance; it's a fact.

<b>

"…Alright. But can you start with just two? If you can defeat them without taking any damage, we can increase the number."

<b>

"That's fine, but are gods usually this cautious?"

<b>

Being a god, even if not omniscient or omnipotent, he should know that I can handle this without issue.

<b>

"You should be more aware of your position in influencing the world's future, SR-kun..."

<b>

With his shoulders slumped, he let out a big sigh.

Noah reluctantly extended both of his palms forward.

<b>

Unlike when the house appeared, black spores converged into one point—then expanded. A Freezing Spider and two Nine-Tails appeared a dozen meters away.

<b>

I took out my red sword from my inventory while keeping an eye on the enemy's movements and did some squats.

<b>

"Alright, let's do this."

<b>

Then, without hesitation, I stepped forward.

<b>

<b>

~Noah Side~

<b>

It has been three full days since SR-kun started leveling up.

<b>

During that time, he hasn’t taken a single break, let alone sleep. As soon as he finishes defeating a monster, he shouts "Next!" in a loud voice, demanding more monsters.

No matter how much I replenish his stamina, seeing him continue to fight with a smile is something I can only describe as abnormal, even from my perspective as a god.

<b>

"By the way, my children called him a 'battle maniac.'"

<b>

SR-kun is currently fighting all the bosses from the S-rank dungeon simultaneously. A one against six—it's a situation that would likely make my children flee barefoot. Ice, fire, wind—various magic and violence are attacking him, yet none have managed to catch him even once.

<b>

There’s absolutely no sign of him losing. Not even a precarious moment has arisen.

On the contrary, I feel like his expression conveys a sense of "not enough."

<b>

"I wonder if it's appropriate to label him a battle maniac with such a cliché term."

<b>

The "eye" I gave him.

I call this eye the "Eye of Origin."

<b>

Not only does it significantly enhance his vision, but it also allows him to judge and react to visual information simultaneously. It’s a special eye that reduces the time lag to zero instead of just decreasing the reaction time.

<b>

"Normally, this shouldn't be possible."

<b>

It seems SR-kun recognizes the skill "Dodge" of the Brawler as something that reduces the time lag from perceiving with his eyes to moving his body, but that’s not the case.

<b>

The time lag that was originally reduced to zero by the "Eye of Origin" is further decreased—meaning it’s a negative.

<b>

He probably doesn’t realize it, but when the Dodge skill is activated, he is seeing a glimpse of the near future with that eye.

<b>

"After all, you’re not normal. You can’t just be an ordinary soul."

<b>

This bizarre scene of six monsters fighting SR-kun, when I get used to it, seems to show that he is the one attacking the monsters rather than the other way around.

<b>

With his unparalleled combat sense and an insatiable desire for victory, is it merely coincidence that he became a suitable candidate for the "eye"?

<b>

"—Or is it fate?"

<b>

Is it destiny that you were born with that name in the country of Japan on the planet Earth,

<b>

"—Or perhaps a calling?"

<b>

The creator god of Earth might know something, but surely he won’t tell me.

<b>

As I watch his battle, lost in such thoughts, the six monsters begin to dissolve into particles one after another, and a large amount of energy flows into me. Then, without missing a beat, he shouts.

<b>

"Next!"

<b>

I silently obeyed his command and summoned six more monsters. He then began to fight again in the same manner. Perhaps because he isn’t physically tired, he shows no signs of wanting to rest. I wonder how long this will continue.

<b>

Watching SR-kun’s back, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear, almost close to terror. As a god, towards him, a mere human.

<b>

"With that 'eye,' you truly resemble a demon of battle."

<b>

In this world, I shouldn’t feel cold, yet I instinctively hugged myself.

Seeing you in your current state of relentless fighting makes me think I should call you by your real name instead of your created character name.

<b>

"Don’t you think so too?"

<b>

Hey, Rokudo—Shui-kun.

<b>

<b>

So, this is the meaning of SR's name!

I think it will be divisive in terms of like or dislike,

<b>

I love this kind of thing!!

<b>

If you think it's "not bad" even a little!
