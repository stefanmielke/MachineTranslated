# 50 Contestants, Additional 1

<b>

<b>

<b>

Before sunset――We returned safely to the royal capital, and due to various circumstances, we decided to split up.

<b>

Fenon-san went back to the royal castle with Siri-san to inform His Majesty of our return, while Sera headed to the Explorer's Guild for the final meeting regarding the martial arts tournament scheduled for tomorrow.

<b>

I thought about informing Jinrai no Kiseki and Regulus-san, but since we would probably see each other tomorrow anyway, I concluded that it wasn't necessary to do it today――After all, they aren't family or lovers, so there's no need for exchanges like "I'm home" or "Welcome back."

I headed to the royal castle with Fenon-san and the others, while they went to the castle, and I made my way to my home, which is in the doghouse position within the grounds.

<b>

<b>

"Wow... it hasn't changed at all."

<b>

As I opened the door to my house, I couldn't help but let those words slip out.

<b>

Usually, when you've been away from home for a long time, the air gets stale, and dust accumulates at your feet, but it seems the maids of the royal castle had done a thorough cleaning, and the room was just as it was when I left a month ago.

<b>

I immediately took a bath to relieve my fatigue, then brewed some coffee and had it along with the bread I had stored in my inventory. Although I was alone in a big house, I was used to this kind of lonely atmosphere. The sound of chewing was the only noise in the room.

<b>

As I was lounging around like that, before I knew it, it was completely dark outside the window.

<b>

There's no manga or games... it's a world lacking in entertainment. No, maybe the existence of dungeons in this world is entertainment itself for me?

<b>

"Well, I am enjoying it, though."

<b>

After muttering to myself, I stretched out on the sofa and, since no one was home, let out a slightly loud strange sound, "Nfuu!"

Then――,

<b>

"Are you okay, Master?"

<b>

A confused-looking Sera called out from the entrance of the living room.

<b>

"Eh――S-Sera!? When did you get here!? I told you to knock when you enter the house!"

<b>

"I did knock, but there was no response..."

<b>

Sera scratched her cheek awkwardly.

Is that really true――? As I shot her a suspicious glance, a familiar trio appeared behind her.

<b>

"Sera did knock properly. It's been a while, SR."

<b>

"Welcome back."

<b>

"Welcome home."

<b>

The ones who appeared with grins were Shin, Suzu, and Laika――the members of Jinrai no Kiseki.

I stammered, "W-Welcome back," and had them sit on the sofa for now. Sera naturally sat next to me. Is that your designated spot?

<b>

After silently apologizing to Sera in my heart for doubting her, I leaned back against the sofa.

<b>

"Tomorrow is the martial arts tournament, so why are you here? Shouldn't you be resting early today?"

<b>

When I said that, Shin replied with a laugh.

<b>

"Don't say something so cold. A friend has returned to the royal capital after a long time; it's unkind not to greet them."

<b>

Is he implying that I'm the "unfeeling one"? He wants to say that, doesn't he?

I'm really sorry about that!

<b>

"Besides, you know, right? The matches with the knight order are just a game. We're not really going to fight seriously."

<b>

"Huh? Isn't it different?"

<b>

"Didn't you hear from the guild master? The main purpose of the martial arts tournament is to showcase the new jobs, so it's more like a demonstration. It's technically in a match format, though."

<b>

Eh... what is that?

Now that I think about it, Regulus-san did mention something like that, but it sounds boring.

I wanted to see a match where they put their all into it.

<b>

Upon hearing more details, it seems the knight order will showcase the strengths of their derived secondary jobs by displaying "the skills of two basic jobs" during the matches.

<b>

Basic job skills can be acquired at levels 25 and 50, but the first skills obtained, excluding the magician's "Projectile Magic" and the priest's "Heal," are passive skills that you can't tell if they're being used or not, like presence detection.

<b>

In other words, the people of the knight order will have to level up another basic job to level 50, separate from the one they were originally leveling, to showcase their skills to the audience.

<b>

Since they were given only a short time since the announcement of the new jobs, the levels of the derived secondary jobs are probably still low. It's hard to believe they were leveling up in a B-rank dungeon like us.

<b>

"But that's the knight order's job, right? You guys are guests, so why not just go all out?"

<b>

Just beat them up. It's not like I have any grudge against the knight order.

<b>

"I don't like picking on the weak."

<b>

"Master! I'm going to give it my all!"

<b>

"Sera, hold back."

<b>

At my words, Sera pouted and looked down. She was pouting her lips and drawing circles with her index finger on her knee. She's really easy to read.

<b>

Shin, alternating his gaze between Sera and me, muttered something unclear like, "Is it really that bad?" then fixed his gaze on me and began to speak.

<b>

"After Sera's individual match as a guest, there's going to be our party match, and there's talk about having SR participate in that."

<b>

"Huh? You mean I'm going to join the Jinrai no Kiseki party?"

<b>

What on earth does that mean?

<b>

Furrowing my brow, I asked, and Shin grinned and shook his index finger while saying, "Tsk, tsk."

<b>

"It's a match between us and just one SR."

<b>

What is he talking about... that's not a good idea.

Unlike the mock battle we had at the guild, there are likely to be many spectators this time.

<b>

"...I don't want to. I don't want to stand out."

<b>

When I said that, not just Shin, but Suzu and Laika also shrugged their shoulders with expressions that said, "Well, well."

<b>

"You say you don't want to stand out, but thanks to conquering the B-rank dungeon and your title, the name 'SR' is already known throughout the country. Plus, since the faces of title holders aren't widely known, there are rumors about 'What kind of person are they?'"

<b>

"..................I understand what you're trying to say, but..."

<b>

Is it the same principle as being curious about the face of a transfer student? Maybe it's a bit different.

<b>

"Don't worry. We've surpassed level 40 with our derived advanced jobs and gained skills, and the audience will likely pay more attention to the new skills than to you."

<b>

Shin and Laika must have been leveling up as martial arts swordsmen, and Suzu as a sage.

That means the skills they've acquired are probably Phantom Blade and Body Enhancement.

<b>

Phantom Blade is a skill that temporarily makes weapons transparent, and Body Enhancement causes the body to glow faintly red while the effect lasts. Both should be easy for the audience to understand.

<b>

Shin glanced briefly at Sera before continuing, "And you know..."

<b>

"As someone who respects SR, it really annoys me to hear people saying, 'They must be weak after all.' Sera understands, right?"

<b>

Sera, being addressed, replied shortly, "Of course."

So that was it?

<b>

"If it's you, you can easily withstand our attacks, right? Once they see that, everyone will have no choice but to accept it."

<b>

...Hmm.

<b>

Indeed, it would be easy to handle the attacks from Jinrai no Kiseki alone.

I don't know what will happen from here on out, but at this point, it seems manageable.

<b>

I had been thinking I didn't want to stand out any more than this, but as Shin said, I already feel like I've stood out quite a bit. In fact, even explorers from other towns and the receptionist from Reinas knew about me.

<b>

I crossed my arms and closed my eyes for a moment to think.

<b>

I thought that if I stood out too much, my freedom would be restricted, but looking back, the reason Regulus-san told me to leave the royal capital was that my abilities hadn't been known to the explorers.

...Is this situation happening because I've ended up standing out just enough?

<b>

When I looked at Sera, she was gazing at me with a pleading expression.

Does she really dislike the idea of me being seen as weak that much?

<b>

"...Fine, I'll participate too."

<b>

As long as I keep my identity as a person from another world and my excessive knowledge hidden, that should be enough. I want Jinrai no Kiseki and Sera to stand out even more than before.

<b>

"Really!?"

<b>

Sera and Shin both exclaimed in joy at the same time, while Suzu and Laika wore combative smiles directed at me.

<b>

"Since we've gotten stronger, you should look forward to it."

<b>

"I'll prove that it's not just our levels that have increased."

<b>

It's nice to see them so excited!

I wish I could have that carefree attitude about participating in the match too!

<b>

If I can create an atmosphere of "barely withstanding the attacks of Jinrai no Kiseki," I should be able to convey my abilities adequately.

<b>

It seems that there's no need for any procedures, and I can participate spontaneously, so I don't need to prepare anything in particular. As long as I have my body, I'm ready to fight.

<b>

Since I've received the grand title of "Hero," it shouldn't be surprising if I put up a good fight against those three. It might be wishful thinking, but I can only hope for that.

<b>

Now I just need to get absorbed in the match and not forget that it's a martial arts tournament. I need to be careful.
