# A-131 Let's Make Sure to Communicate

<b>

<b>

<b>

I bought a house and looked around inside, but there wasn't anything particularly interesting. All the furniture and installed magical tools seemed like things that could be found in Lindale, and it wasn't particularly luxurious.

<b>

Since no one is currently living there, it lacks a sense of life, but it was just an ordinary house. That said, there were five private rooms, a spacious living room, and although there were no food supplies, there seemed to be some tea leaves for tea. If I wanted to make this place more fulfilling, I would need to bring in my belongings properly.

<b>

Well, it feels more suitable for use as a resting place rather than a place to live.

Well, the problem is more than that,

<b>

"This is a big deal, isn't it...?"

<b>

"I want to collect coins, but maybe this comes first."

<b>

"Depends on how we confirm it, though."

<b>

Standing outside the house with two girls, we crossed our arms and looked at the words written next to the front door. I hadn't paid attention to it when I entered because I was too curious about the interior, but there was a silver, elongated plate affixed at eye level.

<b>

On it was the notation '4-D' indicating the location of this house, along with another important phrase written above it.

<b>

'Lindale District'

<b>

"If we can travel between countries inside the dungeon, that could be interesting."

<b>

"There's no border or anything, though."

<b>

Indeed, it might be a troublesome job for some higher-ups. Well, I plan to throw all this work onto Regulus! Because there's nothing I can do!

<b>

<b>

So, after relaxing a bit inside the house, we went to report to Regulus.

It's uncertain whether that dungeon connects to other dungeons, but I know that in times like this, 'reporting, communication, and consultation' are important.

<b>

Well, if I could find out the results right away, I would have rushed in.

<b>

After all, even the closest Palmoor Kingdom took five days the last time I went, right? I stopped by towns along the way, and since I traveled by carriage, it was leisurely, but I think at least one overnight stay is necessary. Considering the round trip, I want to avoid complaints later, and if I accidentally exit through another country's entrance, I want to be able to say, "I properly reported to Regulus!"

<b>

"...It seems that even in Palmoor, they confirmed that Neska can enter the dungeon, but we haven't sent out any information about 'coming back to life after dying' from our side yet. It would be troublesome if something happened."

<b>

"Well, that's true."

<b>

Even if we provided information that it's a dangerous dungeon, handling the information about coming back to life after dying would be difficult. If we explored with the premise of dying and didn't come back to life, it would completely fall on us.

<b>

But Neska... it's been a while.

<b>

She is the female explorer who leads the party 'Crimson Sword,' which praised me when Shin and the others from the Thunder's Trail participated in the international martial arts tournament.

<b>

Since I cleared the S-rank dungeon in Palmoor with her and Prince Niz from Palmoor Kingdom, there probably aren't any other people in that country who can enter dungeons besides those two.

<b>

"Who is Neska?"

<b>

"She's the leader of the representative party from Palmoor Kingdom."

<b>

Come to think of it, it was before we met Crescent that we visited Palmoor.

<b>

"Since it's SR, you must have beaten her up, right?"

<b>

"Why do I have such a combat maniac image?"

<b>

"Did you?"

<b>

"...Well, we did have something like a mock battle."

<b>

Feeling a bit embarrassed that I was just as they expected, I mumbled my answer, and Regulus chuckled before speaking.

<b>

"According to what I heard from their guild master, you apparently swept them in a five-on-one mock battle. Fortunately, it seems their spirits weren't broken."

<b>

Please don't leak unnecessary information.

And if I may make an excuse, I'm more accustomed to multiple opponents than one-on-one in human combat. Besides, the five-on-one format is something I often fought in Tempest, so it allows me to perform at my best.

<b>

"I wonder if I should fight against Neska's party too."

<b>

"Listen... when I went there, they hadn't even cleared an A-rank dungeon yet. Just forget it."

<b>

"But SR fought against Neska's group, right?"

<b>

"...Can you phrase that differently?"

<b>

At least with Crescent, but I wish you wouldn't say that to Hisui since she seems innocent.

Hearing my words, Hisui blushed and apologized, saying, "I'm sorry."

<b>

"Princess, there's no need to apologize. That was completely SR's fault for being too conscious of that kind of thing. This is why boys... they always try to take things in a lewd direction..."

<b>

"If it's Hisui pointing it out, I can accept it, but it's annoying to hear it from Crescent."

<b>

"Why!? How do you see me as anything but a pure, beautiful girl!?"

<b>

"What do you think, Hisui?"

<b>

"Well, I don't want to align with Mika's opinion, but surprisingly, she's quite pure. Apparently, she's a virgin."

<b>

"Princess, wh-what are you saying!?"

<b>

"You guys can go to the dungeon now, so please don't have those kinds of conversations in my office..."

<b>

I'm sorry, Regulus. But this time, I'm not in the wrong, right?
