# A-123 Conclusion

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suddenly, Crescent and Hisui barged into the battle between me and Noah.

I thought they would side with me, but their judgment was――hostile.

By opposing me, they were actually supporting me in a rather complicated situation.

<b>

The reason is that their intention is to make me give it my all. To remind me of the game days. Indeed, I am more accustomed to facing multiple opponents than a one-on-one duel with Noah.

<b>

Although this situation is complicated, it’s one where I could simply cut my own throat to resolve it. However, I believe that neither Noah nor I should do that. We are in a world like a game, in a dungeon like a game, but this is ultimately reality.

<b>

“Wait a moment, I need to change my equipment.”

<b>

I said that and took out clothes from my inventory.

“The Black Coffin”――the black outfit I used to wear during the game era. It has low magic and physical resistance, but it boosts AGI and DEX, and it’s a drop from an S-rank dungeon. Although, I didn’t acquire it by frequenting S-rank dungeons; it was given to me by Noah during the Venom battle.

<b>

“……Sorry, could you turn away?”

<b>

The atmosphere was tense, but I couldn’t let Crescent and Hisui see my changing scene, at least not Noah. I hurriedly finished changing and informed them. Naturally, I held the Byakuren in my hand and changed my class from Overlord to Demon King.

<b>

In terms of strength, the Overlord is probably stronger. Although its base stats are lower compared to other third-tier classes, it can benefit from various skills. However, I still lack the proficiency.

<b>

If that’s the case, it’s better to go with the Demon King, who is more accustomed to fighting.

Having many options means needing more time to think.

<b>

“Oh, seeing that outfit, you look like an SR!”

<b>

“I’m starting to feel a bit thrilled.”

<b>

Seeing my appearance after changing, my former game companions said such words. As for Noah, she remained silent, a combative smile on her face.

<b>

“Well then, I’m ready whenever.”

<b>

“I’m fine too.”

<b>

Following Noah, Crescent and Hisui also stated they were ready.

Alright, let’s go all out.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

“Hah!? That definitely hit!”

<b>

“Sorry, it missed. Maybe I grazed a bit of hair.”

<b>

“Noah, please circle around from the right and keep them at bay!”

<b>

“You don’t need to say it, Hisui. I can read your mind.”

<b>

“Yeah, I can tell without you saying it, Noah. Changing to Spirit Archer and using Binding Arrow? And if that gets noticed, you plan to cover it with a dummy magic arrow and shoot a normal arrow?”

<b>

“――Seriously! You’re really like a monster!”

<b>

“You have an expression that makes it obvious you can read thoughts! Try to hide it a bit!”

<b>

Shouting that, I pretended to kick Noah in the stomach――but instead, I spun around and punched her in the face. Without hesitation, she defended her abdomen, leaving her vulnerable to my attack. I had intended to kick her seriously just before, so it’s no wonder she couldn’t read my thoughts.

<b>

I switched the Byakuren from my left hand to my right and looked back, where Crescent and Hisui had found an opening and rushed in.

<b>

Ah, that’s not how it works. It’s not that simple. I wouldn’t expose such an obvious opening.

<b>

As I switched the Byakuren, I released the magic I had been charging in my left hand. It wasn’t elemental magic like fire, wind, or water; it was a simple magic cannon. My target was Hisui, who was coming at me from the left.

<b>

She should be able to dodge this easily――well, I know which direction she’ll escape to.

<b>

“――Hisui has a clear direction to dodge and is easily led. Plus, she has a habit of bracing for the next attack, but that needs to change.”

<b>

It sounds good to say she’s preparing for the next attack, but in her case, she’s too rigid. She lacks flexibility.

<b>

“That’s why she falls for simple feints.”

<b>

I threw the Byakuren at her while charging forward at a speed that surpassed it. After knocking her back, I retrieved the Byakuren and counterattacked while dodging Crescent’s attack from behind.

<b>

“――As expected of an SR, you have eyes on the back of your head! I mean, in this situation, only a fool would try to counterattack like you!”

<b>

“Calling me a fool is quite offensive!”

<b>

We parried each other’s swords and exchanged blows for a few seconds. Soon, Noah and Hisui joined in, but when I glared at them, both hesitated to attack.

<b>

“I won’t let you take it easy.”

<b>

Saying that, I activated gravity magic towards the direction where Noah and Hisui were. Crescent let out a dissatisfied voice, “I’m in the middle of fighting you!?”

<b>

The two dashed away to escape the gravity magic――now, shall I attack Noah?

It seems my punch to her face still lingers.

<b>

“See you again.”

<b>

“Wait! Are you trying to run away?”

<b>

“Gotcha, opening!”

<b>

“――Ugh, ugh!”

<b>

Pretending to run towards Noah, I immediately turned around and delivered a kick to Crescent’s abdomen. After slashing her left arm with the Byakuren, I kicked Hisui, who was attacking from behind me.

<b>

Then, I slashed Crescent’s same arm again, which was reeling from the pain, and unleashed maximum gravity magic on Hisui to crush her.

<b>

“Now, see you again for real.”

<b>

“――How many eyes do you have…?”

<b>

“Two. Use your senses more.”

<b>

I spat out a parting shot and turned my gaze towards Noah. She was running towards me with two longswords, her posture low. She wants to fight me head-on? Bring it on.

<b>

“Don’t just rely on bravado.”

<b>

With a sharp sound, our swords clashed.

<b>

“Haha, you’re getting more and more foul-mouthed. You weren’t like this during the Tempest game.”

<b>

“That was in ranking battles. But against monsters, it’s like this.”

<b>

“Is that so?”

<b>

“Yeah.”

<b>

As I said that, I deflected Noah’s attacks. While avoiding her weak strikes, I also landed blows on her body. No blood came out――only particles of light floated from her body. Noah’s expression twisted in pain, yet she showed no signs of stopping.

<b>

“Now! Hisui, Crescent!”

<b>

Suddenly, Noah shouted, without any warning.

But I understood. Crescent and Hisui shouldn’t be in a position to rush over to us yet. I couldn’t hear their footsteps.

<b>

“You’re so obvious.”

<b>

At the same time Noah shouted a fake call, she swung her sword high. I deflected that sword to counterattack――the sword, the sword?

<b>

“……Ah, it slipped out. That hurts a lot.”

<b>

She tossed her sword behind her and took my Byakuren’s attack to her chest. Then, clutching her chest, she collapsed on the spot and smiled faintly.

<b>

“Did you do that on purpose…?”

<b>

“What are you talking about? You cut my finger with the Byakuren. I don’t have three fingers, so what can I do?”

<b>

“……That’s right.”

<b>

“So this wasn’t on purpose. Hmm, in terms of pain, it’s lighter compared to reality, but it’s still quite intense――I wouldn’t say it’s a fracture, but it feels like a severe bruise. Oh, and definitely don’t heal. I need to confirm what happens after death in this dungeon.”

<b>

Unconsciously making a painful expression, Noah reached out to me to stop my actions. Although I hadn’t moved yet.

<b>

Soon, Noah’s entire body was enveloped in light,

<b>

“Well then, bye-bye.”

<b>

Leaving those words behind, the particles of light ascended to the heavens.

I stared at that scene in a daze.

<b>

“SR! Outside! Let’s go outside!”

<b>

“I’ll head out first!”

<b>

First, Crescent, and then shortly after, Hisui exited the dungeon.

<b>

“――Right, I need to confirm Noah’s safety.”

<b>

I followed them and escaped from the dungeon.

What I saw there were the guards I had seen on the way in, along with Crescent and Hisui. And Regulus, who was glaring at me with a sleepy face.

<b>

However, Noah was not there――――or rather, that was not the case.

<b>

“Looks like all the pain disappears once you exit the dungeon! That’s great!”

<b>

With a cheerful expression, she said that.
