# A-116 Let's Go to the New World

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Indeed, Ideya-sama is amazing—it's probably like creating another world in a simulated way."

<b>

Noah looks around and says. It really seems to be true.

<b>

I wonder how vast this world is, what the edges of the world are like, what kinds of monsters exist... there are too many things I'm curious about.

<b>

It feels like the status and system have been directly transplanted from another game. What is that, it's the best!

<b>

"SR-san, I can't hold back my excitement anymore! Can I go now?"

<b>

"Of course not. Everyone is waiting outside—besides, I want to explore this world quickly too... and SR-san is holding back like crazy."

<b>

Hisui says with an exasperated tone to Crescent, who is leaning forward. Then she glances at me and smiles wryly.

<b>

I, like Crescent, had unconsciously started to step a little bit outside the cobblestone. It was truly an involuntary action. After all, I want to see new monsters quickly.

<b>

"That's right, Crescent—no sneaking off alone."

<b>

"Well, how about sneaking off together?"

<b>

What sweet words are coming from this guy...! Is he a devil?

I grit my teeth and manage to overcome the temptation, then calm down a bit.

<b>

Since it's an open world, does that mean the five-person limit unique to dungeons is gone and everyone can enter together? For now, it seems that no monsters are appearing around this cobblestone area, so it should be fine to call the girls waiting outside the dungeon.

<b>

"Noah, could you try to see if you can return alone in an emergency?"

<b>

Maybe it’s possible for just one person to leave. In dungeons, if one person chose emergency return, it affected the entire party. However, due to the specifications of this world, it might be possible to return alone.

<b>

"You really want to gaze at this scenery for even a second longer, huh? I think that's nice, just like an older brother."

<b>

Noah laughs and then operates the window. As I expected, she disappeared from this place alone.

<b>

"Oh... Noah really could go."

<b>

This significantly increases our freedom. However, during combat, the other members can't operate the window to help, but in this world where death doesn't exist, that might not be very necessary. At most, we might just incur a death penalty.

<b>

"The possibilities are expanding. I'm really looking forward to what kind of monsters will appear."

<b>

"I hope there are challenging enemies."

<b>

I can't really say anything about others, but these two are quite the battle maniacs too.

<b>

"Hey, I feel the same way as you two, but if we become the 'challenging level,' that would mean venom level, right? If there are tons of monsters like that, it would still be tough for Sera and the others."

<b>

"Ah... that's true."

<b>

"But, there might be quite a variety of monsters, and maybe there are some that Sera-san, Phenon-san, and Shiri-san can handle?"

<b>

I see.

<b>

Given the vastness of this world, it's possible that the strength is somewhat determined by the area. Are there boss-like monsters wandering around too?

<b>

It's the roaming type. That’s a feature that wasn’t in Tempest.

<b>

As I was getting excited with the other Earthlings, the other ASR members arrived. It seems Noah brought everyone along.

<b>

The three of them are looking at the outside scenery before they even notice us.

<b>

"Is this... really inside a dungeon?"

<b>

"Hey Sera, it feels like we've come to a different land."

<b>

"Indeed. I wonder how far our powers will be effective..."

<b>

All three are talking, but they are looking around restlessly. Well, it’s pretty normal to act like this in a first dungeon, even if it’s not here.

<b>

"Welcome, everyone—earlier, I confirmed two types of monsters from a distance, so I think this dungeon probably has various monsters. Also, I don't think it's a case of 'defeat XX to clear the dungeon.' It really feels like a dungeon aimed at improving combat skills and leveling up."

<b>

When I add that it’s just a prediction, Crescent and Hisui agree with my words. They think so too. After all, they said item drops wouldn’t happen.

<b>

"Of course, I'm curious about the upper limit, but considering Sera-san and the others, I'm also curious about the lower limit. Oh, I mean the strength of the monsters."

<b>

"That's true."

<b>

It would be great if there were some manageable monsters nearby—but it seems that monsters might not be able to approach the area around this cobblestone, as there are none in sight.

<b>

"For now, let's take a little walk."

<b>

I want to know the sensation of taking damage. Although it’s a system where we don’t die, and blood probably won’t spurt out, it shouldn’t be at the same level of pain as in a game.

<b>

If I do that in this world, my judgment in actual combat might become dull.

Well, even though we don’t die, they must have designed that aspect properly. Not with shallow thinking like mine, but thoroughly.

<b>

"Okay, SR-san, let’s decide who will fight first with rock-paper-scissors!"

<b>

"Okay, I’m ready for that...!"

<b>

"If I win, I'll give it to SR-san. But I’ll participate since it would be annoying to let Mika go first."

<b>

And so, the result of the match—Hisui won all by herself.

<b>

Did some kind of desire sensor activate...? I felt a bit hesitant to let others win so easily, so Hisui ended up taking the lead.

<b>

By the way, I lost to Crescent too. How sad. My sensor might have been too strong.
