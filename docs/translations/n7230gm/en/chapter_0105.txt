# 102 I Will Get It Back

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Then I'll create it."

<b>

"Yeah. Just do it quickly."

<b>

After confirming that I had given a positive response, Noah created a spiral staircase that reached up to the heavens in one breath, following the same procedure as when she created the dwelling.

While the flow was the same, the scale was on a completely different level. The sight of a pillar of light over ten meters in diameter ascending into the sky looked mystical, even to my eyes, which struggled to understand such beauty.

<b>

What was completed was truly just a staircase. Made of stone, it spiraled endlessly upward into the sky. Since we were about to challenge the final boss, I wished she could have prepared a more stylish staircase to set the mood.

<b>

"Spending energy on something like that would be a problem if you ran out of strength during the battle."

<b>

This guy is once again assuming my thoughts...

<b>

"Well, it's free to think."

<b>

Without waiting for Noah's response, I stepped onto the staircase, which was only about 20 centimeters thick. I lightly pressed down on it, but it didn't feel like it would break. It seemed to be sturdier than it looked.

<b>

However, it was only about three meters wide, and of course, there were no convenient handrails. If I didn't consciously walk in the center, I could easily fall from a high position and meet my end without even facing Venom. That would be no laughing matter.

<b>

"I'm here, so you'll be fine. Want to try falling from the top once?"

<b>

"Absolutely not."

<b>

"Just kidding."

<b>

Noah giggled, covering her mouth.

<b>

If my body hadn't been destroyed by Venom—and if my existence wasn't in danger—her smiling face would probably be even more beautiful...

<b>

I wanted to punch myself for even thinking that, even for a moment.

<b>

"Look forward to it."

<b>

I've thought this many times, but reading minds is cheating.

I couldn't muster any retort or energy, so I could only look down and let out a small sigh.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

During the time I was leveling up for the battle against Venom, I had spent nearly 300 hours continuously fighting the bosses in S-rank dungeons.

So when I heard from Noah that it would take "24 hours on the staircase," I thought the position of Venom was high, but I didn't think it would take that long to reach it. To put it simply, my sense of time had gone haywire.

<b>

However, that was only because I was doing something I enjoyed; continuously climbing a staircase was pure suffering. Was this my hell?

<b>

"Noah, I might be done for. I'm so bored I feel like I'm going to die."

<b>

"It hasn't even been two hours yet... Want to play shiritori again? I'll start—apple!"

<b>

"Rice."

<b>

"Um, 'n'... wait, that's not allowed!? You really have no intention of playing, do you!?"

<b>

"Are you serious? Playing shiritori before a battle that could lead to the world's destruction? Also, your comeback lacks punch."

<b>

"You were the one who suggested this game first, you know!? And could you stop with the criticism!?"

<b>

Noah floated beside me, puffing her cheeks.

Satisfied with her dissatisfied expression, I moved my feet forward and changed the subject, saying, "By the way..."

<b>

"What to do with the world after defeating Venom—I'm really unsure."

<b>

"Is that what you're worried about again? You can think about it as much as you want, but try not to during the battle."

<b>

"That's not a problem. I'll be too focused on the fight anyway."

<b>

I replied that and continued to climb the staircase, thinking about this and that in my head.

<b>

What I was currently troubled by was the question of what period of the world Noah would recreate after defeating Venom.

<b>

Initially, I thought, "Should it be the time I was summoned?" or "Maybe even earlier?" but it seemed I had the right to choose. This was extremely difficult.

<b>

"Recreating the exact situation from when I was summoned... it would be sad for Phenon to suffer."

<b>

However, it seemed difficult for Phenon and me to interact in such a situation. I could manage with Jinrai and Sera, but if the other party was royalty, just meeting them would be a very high difficulty.

<b>

"Humans, you know, when others decide things for them, they say things like 'It would have been better if...' or 'Don't mess with me,' but when given the choice, many can't decide."

<b>

"Shut up, I'm thinking about various things. You just play shiritori by yourself."

<b>

"Isn't my treatment getting worse and worse!? I'm a god of creation, you know!?"

<b>

Ignoring Noah's protest with a surprised expression, I thought about the battle with Venom and the world that would be recreated.

While killing time by talking moderately with Noah, I aimed for the place where Venom was.

<b>

<b>

And in the end, without being able to decide the future of the world...

<b>

"I've arrived... huh. It's not the Demon King's Castle."

<b>

I had already known this from a distance, but I voiced it to Noah as if seeking her agreement.

<b>

"That's just for the game. Creating such a gaudy building would only waste my power."

<b>

"That's true."

<b>

The circular ground seemed to be over 100 meters in diameter. Speaking of which, a certain famous game I used to play also had a stage like this when fighting the final boss.

<b>

As soon as I stepped from the staircase to that place, the staircase vanished without a trace. Although I caught the scene in my sight, my attention was focused elsewhere. Noah, too, had her gaze fixed straight ahead, just like me.

<b>

A pale blue crystal. That large diamond shape seemed to be Noah's seal on Venom. Beyond the translucent seal was my long-time rival—the enemy I had lost to repeatedly and finally defeated—Venom's figure.

<b>

Venom's body was 5 meters long—5 meters in diameter. After all, this guy's body was a sphere.

<b>

The round sphere, seemingly made from gathered flesh and blood, was pulsating clearly even from this distance of several dozen meters.

In the center of the body, there was a horizontal line. If Tempest had faithfully recreated this god of destruction Venom, that line wouldn't split in half but would open and close vertically. That was only natural, as that was Venom's eyelid.

<b>

To be frank, it looked quite grotesque.

I secretly thought, "Indeed!" when some players in Tempest referred to it as "meatball." I was a solo player, so I hadn't interacted much with those people.

<b>

"Feeling nostalgic?"

<b>

As I stared blankly at the Venom wrapped in the seal, Noah asked me that. The slight tension in her face suggested she was somewhat nervous too.

<b>

"Well... without a doubt, the one I've fought the most in Tempest is this guy."

<b>

When I first fought this guy, I was utterly defeated. In fact, I couldn't even land a proper attack for several months.

<b>

Even so, I won.

After hundreds and thousands of defeats, I firmly seized victory.

<b>

I took the throne from the Overlord Venom.

<b>

However, that was only within the game of Tempest.

Right now, the one holding the reins of this world was neither me nor the god of creation Noah—it was this god of destruction Venom.

<b>

If this guy reigned at the top, then I would take that seat from him.

Whether the opponent was a god or whatever, if this was created with the same mechanism as the game Tempest—then that peak is not yours.

<b>

A defeat is not allowed.

If I were to lose, neither Noah, the world, nor Sera would be saved; rather, I would face an incredibly bitter ending where I alone would return to the original world and live on.

<b>

Even if my lifespan were shortened, it wouldn't matter.

If that were to happen, I would likely take my own life.

<b>

But I won't let such a future happen.

In the first place, regardless of the world's collapse, I would not allow "defeat" to be permitted by anyone other than myself.

<b>

"I will get it back."

<b>

My comrades.

<b>

The world.

<b>

—And the "peak."
