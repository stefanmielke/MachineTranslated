# A-107 Kotatsu

<b>

<b>

<b>

I had a great time in Rezel, playing in the S-rank dungeon, giving guidance at the guild, and having mock battles with the Vinzett siblings and Princess Katariya.

<b>

In Lindale, a new home for Hisui and Crescent is being built, so it’s been about two months since I left Lindale.

<b>

Just exploring the parts of the city I hadn’t seen was enough to pass the time, and I also visited lower-ranked dungeons to kill some time.

<b>

By the time I returned to Lindale, their house was completed as planned.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Whoa! Look at my home! When I think about how I would have been suffering with a ‘35-year mortgage’ back on Earth, this world really is the best!”

<b>

Their house was slightly larger than a typical single-family home on Earth, and compared to mine, it felt a bit cozy. However, they had a spacious garden, and the decorations were elaborate without being overly flashy, giving off an impression that it must have cost a fair amount of money.

<b>

The log cabin-like appearance is similar to mine.

<b>

“I said I’d build next door, but since the garden is spacious, there’s quite a distance between the houses.”

<b>

Hisui also expressed her thoughts while crossing her arms and gazing at the house. Indeed, it seemed to be about fifty meters apart. There’s a fence, so even though they’re neighbors, it feels a bit ambiguous.

<b>

Since Crescent and Hisui had finished the handover of the building from the contractor, I decided to take a look inside right away.

The other party members were relaxing at my house for the time being. With the family of the servant Shiri and Rei-san there, they probably had a lot to talk about. I was eager to see Crescent and Hisui’s house, so I came over first.

<b>

I did chat for about thirty minutes, but it seemed they still had more to say.

Perhaps they were being considerate of the Earth group.

<b>

“Well then, let’s explore like true adventurers.”

<b>

Considering this is a girl’s house, it might not be very appropriate, but it’s fine, right? Crescent and Hisui were eager to show me around, so I decided to check every nook and cranny.

<b>

<b>

From the bedroom to the bathroom, I was shown various places in the girls’ house that I wouldn’t expect to see, and wow, it was quite nice.

<b>

My own house is pretty luxurious, but thinking about how the two of them would live together, this is a rather extravagant residence. Well, considering the income they are likely to earn in the future, this would probably be pocket change, and if compared to their income, it would be castle-level, so this might have been just right.

<b>

Then, I saw something installed in their house that got me really excited.

<b>

“Does this get warm? Was there such an item?”

<b>

It’s more like furniture. It’s a square kotatsu. A smaller kotatsu that doesn’t quite match the size of the house.

Even though there were home-like elements during the Tempest era, I never had anyone come over since I wasn’t close with anyone, so I didn’t even own a house.

So I’m not that familiar with furniture… but I’ve never seen anything like this.

<b>

“I’ve heard there are magical tools like that. There are communication magical tools, and to go further, there are even regular meals like curry, so it’s a bit late to mention it.”

<b>

“There was one in Tempest as well. It wasn’t popular for reasons like the atmosphere being different, and this is my first time using it.”

<b>

So there was one.

<b>

Indeed, the houses I see in the city have a Western or Nordic style… so a kotatsu would feel out of place. Sofas were the norm after all.

<b>

While thinking about that, I got permission from the two of them and put my feet into the kotatsu.

There was a fluffy carpet laid out, so my rear didn’t hurt at all.

<b>

“We also have cushions.”

<b>

“Seriously?”

<b>

I placed the reddish-brown cushion that Hisui handed me under my butt. It felt really nice. If I closed my eyes, I might mistake it for being in Japan.

Following me, Hisui and Crescent also put their feet into the kotatsu. When Hisui put her hands in and a ‘click’ sound was heard, it gradually started to warm up.

<b>

“Ah, this is nice. I want one for my house too. How much was it?”

<b>

“Ten thousand oru.”

<b>

Wow, about a hundred thousand yen. That’s quite expensive. It seems that for the people in this world, a kotatsu is quite a luxury item.

However, I have enough savings that I don’t need to worry about the price, but I wonder what the residents of this world, like Sera, would think… somehow, I feel like this style might not be good for royalty or nobility. After all, it lowers your head position.

<b>

As I pondered with my arms crossed, Hisui called out, “Well, well.”

<b>

“You don’t have to buy one for your house. You can just come over to ours. We’re neighbors, and I’ll give you the key, so you can come in whenever you want.”

<b>

“Is that really okay?”

<b>

I shifted my gaze to Crescent and asked. Before we set off, they were practically living at my place, so I didn’t mind much… 

<b>

“Well, it’s SR-san, so if the wives are okay with it, there shouldn’t be a problem, right?”

<b>

I see. I’ll ask Sera and the others about it later.
