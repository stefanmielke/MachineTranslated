# 65 The Meaning of Being Summoned

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next day.

As promised, I went to Serah's family home, where I met her father, Count Rude-Bernot.

<b>

It seems that I am very welcomed by this family, and I fell into the illusion that I had become a very important person.

However, I quickly remembered my life in Japan and managed to calm myself.

If this world is a game, I’m still a NEET no matter how much time passes!

<b>

The content of the Count's conversation was about 30% gratitude for training Serah.

Additionally, he mentioned that the taxes for the Lindale territory were exempted, which I was indirectly involved in, so that accounted for another 30%.

And then there was about 30% of the conversation regarding dungeon exploration.

<b>

The remaining 10% was, how should I put it—well, it was about love and romance.

If it’s alright with you, I would like you to take care of Serah—he bowed his head at the end. What exactly am I to be called by the Count, who adds “-sama” to my name? I hope it’s something other than a hero.

<b>

So, before I could bring up the topic of cohabitation, it felt like I had been preempted.

<b>

He tried to offer me jewels and money as thanks, but I declined all of it. This kind of exchange seems to have some ulterior motive and is very troublesome.

I conveyed that if he could support Serah, it would indirectly help me, and I left her house.

<b>

<b>

“Ah, I feel more at ease with this kind of disheveled vibe.”

<b>

“I’m not disheveled at all. Shin is, though.”

<b>

“If you’re saying that to all the explorers, that’s regrettable. It’s fine for Shin, but…”

<b>

“Hey. That’s not something you should say when I’m right in front of you.”

<b>

In the guild tavern. It was a little past 3 PM.

<b>

All the explorers had gone off to the dungeon, and since it was a somewhat awkward time for a meal, there were only a few people around.

<b>

As a few explorers noticed us and glanced our way, I was sitting at a table with the Thunderbolt Trail. At least for me, Thunderbolt Trail seemed to be quite famous from the start, so it couldn’t be helped.

<b>

Serah remained at her family home and was preparing to head to Leinas.

Surely, Phenon and Shiri were talking to the king or selecting what to take by now, so I decided to talk with Regulus and Thunderbolt Trail in the meantime.

<b>

When I informed Regulus that I would be staying in Leinas for a while, he lent me one half of a communication magic tool. This way, I could contact him at the guild in the royal capital anytime, allowing me to give instructions to Thunderbolt Trail remotely.

<b>

“Speaking of which, you just returned to the royal capital and are leaving again right away. You could take it a bit slower.”

<b>

After moistening my throat with a cup of water, Shin said with dissatisfaction.

In the end, while I said I would train them, I had only crossed swords with them directly during the martial arts tournament. I’ll have to accept the scolding.

<b>

“Sorry. Ideally, it would be better for Thunderbolt Trail to come to Leinas with us, but I want you guys to supply elixirs to the kingdom for a while, and the A-rank dungeon you’re supposed to conquer is on the opposite side of Leinas from the royal capital.”

<b>

“Isn’t there an A-rank dungeon near Leinas?”

<b>

In response to Suzu’s question, I shook my head.

<b>

“Even if they’re both A-rank dungeons, the difficulty is completely different. Of the 15 A-rank dungeons in this world, the easiest one is the A-rank dungeon near the city of Vels, which I want you guys to go to, while the hardest one is the A-rank dungeon in Leinas.”

<b>

The drops and experience points are better, but what they most desire is the achievement of “Conquering an A-rank Dungeon.” After all, it’s an unprecedented feat.

<b>

When I said that, Laika switched the topic, saying, “By the way…”

<b>

“How many S-rank dungeons does Esuar say will appear? The higher the rank, the fewer dungeons there are, right?”

<b>

As Laika pointed out, the number of dungeons decreases as the rank increases.

There are over 300 F-rank dungeons, and there’s only one S-rank dungeon in the world.

<b>

“If my guess is correct, there are six. In other words, one for each country.”

<b>

There are a total of six countries in this world. I confirmed this with Serah before, so it’s definitely accurate.

<b>

If I can directly apply the knowledge from the game, the countries in this world are designed to have roughly equal land area and dungeon numbers. While there are regional characteristics, there shouldn’t be any country that has an advantage or disadvantage.

<b>

“I’d rather talk about conquering the A-rank dungeon than hear about the previous topic.”

<b>

“That’s true.”

<b>

Shin, as the party leader, is likely prioritizing the safety of his teammates—his expression is completely serious. That cautious attitude, which is not optimistic, is unique to this world. In the game era, it didn’t matter how many times you died, so going in with the assumption of returning from death was normal.

<b>

As Suzu took notes, I discussed the professions that Thunderbolt Trail would level up and gave tactical advice—also commenting on weapons and such.

<b>

I believe my suggestions for leveling up professions are correct, but I’m not sure if the other advice is the optimal solution. So I told them to take it as a reference.

<b>

I instructed them to report their leveling progress to Regulus every month, and I concluded my conversation with Thunderbolt Trail.

<b>

Most likely, they will conquer the A-rank dungeon around the same time we finish collecting our rings. It depends on the luck of the drops, though.

<b>

<b>

After leaving the guild, I stretched and looked up at the sky.

<b>

“The sun is still high... I’m bored, so I guess I’ll head to a dungeon.”

<b>

I muttered to myself softly and made my way toward the B-rank dungeon. It’s not that I want elixirs, nor do I want to level up immediately.

<b>

Right now, I am supplying what people need and earning money from it. In other words, it’s like a job.

<b>

However, I don’t feel like I’m working. Rather, it feels more like I’m playing.

<b>

This is reality—while I understand in my head that my life is at stake in battles in dungeons, somewhere in my heart, I feel like I’m still thinking of it as a “game.”

<b>

What is the reality of it, I wonder.

<b>

Is this world modeled after the Japanese game “Tempest”?

At the very least, it’s unlikely to be completely unrelated, but I don’t know the details. It’s also possible that I’m just having a long dream.

<b>

If this is a world created by a god, what could be the meaning of my being summoned here?

<b>

It can’t be that I was summoned randomly—after all, I was able to come to this world precisely because I defeated the Demon King Venom alone. It’s clear that this world desired a strong individual.

<b>

But—,

<b>

If it’s to save Phenon, then it shouldn’t have to be me.

<b>

Even if I couldn’t defeat the Demon King Venom alone, there were many strong players in Tempest who could easily gain the title of “Strongest” just by coming to this world. Among them are players who can wield techniques more diverse than Shin and mimic Serah better.

Of course, there would be differences in methods, but they could have saved Phenon just like I could.

<b>

I was summoned to this world not for the reason of saving Phenon, but for some other, much more difficult problem to solve—.

I was thinking like that in the corner of my mind.
