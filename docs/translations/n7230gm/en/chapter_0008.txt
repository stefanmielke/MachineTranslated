# 7 The Playful Mock Battle

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hey, isn't that red-haired girl over there the daughter of Count Bernot?"

<b>

"Yeah, that's Lady Sera. The Guild Master is with her too. Are they going to practice or something?"

<b>

"—No, there's another black-haired guy. If that's the case, is it a mock battle?"

<b>

"No way, no way. She wouldn't be a match for him. Lady Sera is the fastest person in history to obtain a C-rank license since registration. I’ve never even seen the guy's face; he must be a newbie, right?"

<b>

<b>

I, Regulus-san, and Sera-san arrived at the training ground behind the Explorer's Guild.

Is it about the size of a futsal court?

It's a bit small for a training ground, but considering the space available in the royal capital, it’s quite spacious.

Some explorers are sitting on the ground, chatting, and casting curious glances our way.

<b>

"Use this weapon. Since Esuar is also a swordsman, a sword should be fine, right?"

<b>

Saying that, he took out two wooden swords from his inventory. They are about 60 centimeters long, roughly the same size as the short sword I bought yesterday.

Sera-san, who received the sword as if snatching it, continued to glare at me without saying anything to Regulus-san.

<b>

"Ah, I don't need a sword. Even without it, her attacks wouldn't even graze me."

<b>

I didn't take the wooden sword offered by Regulus-san. Perhaps tired of warning me not to provoke her, he let out a big sigh.

<b>

In reality, that statement is true, but there are things you should and shouldn't say. This is definitely one of those times you shouldn't—yet, it's necessary to provoke her.

If this were a manga, there would probably be a sound effect like "Buchi!" coming from her temple.

<b>

"Hey, Guild Master. Let’s get started quickly."

<b>

"Ah... just make sure not to use lethal attacks. If that happens, I'll step in. —Now, both of you, take your positions."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

Sera-san and I faced each other about ten meters apart.

Hmm, her gaze is sharp. Even though I’m confident I can win, I feel a bit intimidated. If this weren't a game world, I would have turned around and run away by now.

<b>

This is the first time I've had a good look at her standing like this.

<b>

As expected, the most distinctive feature is her fiery hair color. Her long hair, gently lifted by the wind, looked like flames flickering.

She wears clothes made of high-quality fabric, with armor that protects only the essential areas. Just by looking at her equipment, it's clear that she prioritizes mobility.

Her body line is well-defined, with curves in the right places. Her face is small and beautiful; if she were on Earth, she would probably be scouted as a model.

<b>

Regulus-san, positioned to form a triangle with Sera-san and me, confirmed that we were ready and raised his voice.

<b>

"Now, we will begin the mock battle. The match will end when one party declares 'I give up' or becomes unable to act—alternatively, if I determine that continuation is impossible. Additionally, if Esuar can evade Sera's attacks for more than five minutes this time, he will be declared the winner!"

<b>

His clear and crisp tone reached both me and Sera-san, but it seemed to have been heard by the surrounding explorers as well. I could hear murmurs of excitement.

<b>

Oops, focus, focus. I'm one of the participants here. I can't afford to be leisurely worrying about my surroundings.

<b>

"—Begin!"

<b>

With a particularly loud voice, Regulus-san shouted. At the same time,

<b>

"Haahhh!"

<b>

Sera-san charged straight at me. She swung her sword high above her head.

Even though she's a level 60 swordsman, if she hasn't branched into other professions, her AGI would be F—meaning she isn't much different from me.

<b>

I lightly jumped sideways to evade the sword swung with brute force. It was far too wide of a swing. It was almost as if she was inviting me to dodge.

<b>

"Die!!"

<b>

Hey, hey, I thought we agreed not to kill each other.

<b>

Continuing, she aimed for my neck with another swing. I took half a step back and raised my chin to avoid it. Only the wind reached my throat.

<b>

"—Tch."

<b>

"What’s wrong? Is this the best that a D-rank dungeon conqueror can do?"

<b>

"…I will definitely kill you."

<b>

After that, she swung her sword with fierce determination, but her blade never managed to touch my body.

<b>

I was a bit nervous since it had been a while since my last PVP, but I was starting to calm down. I could begin to pick up on the voices around me.

<b>

<b>

"Wh-What the hell—who is that guy? Lady Sera isn't even a match for him!? Was there someone like that in B-rank?"

<b>

"Um, you might not believe me, but—can you listen?"

<b>

"What? Don't keep us in suspense."

<b>

"I saw him at the guild yesterday. I was curious because I had never seen him before."

<b>

"Huh? So what?"

<b>

"He was probably registering as a new member then."

<b>

"Hahhh!? That’s just impossible, right!?"

<b>

<b>

It seems the conversation is about me.

I don't like standing out and making it hard to move, but having my abilities recognized like this is truly satisfying as a gamer. I'm happy.

<b>

Feeling good, I decided to attempt a counterattack.

<b>

"—Take this! You little pest!"

<b>

Sera-san's attacks had been going on for about three minutes since the mock battle began, but she still hadn't managed to hit me.

And with me dodging lightly while she swung her sword with all her might, the difference in stamina was becoming apparent.

<b>

"—Hah, hah—die!"

<b>

With such a violent battle cry, she took a big step toward me. What followed was a thrust aimed at my right eye.

<b>

In response, I stepped forward just like her. My right hand formed a cat's paw—a palm strike.

<b>

Ah, it's fine. Just like in the game, I can see everything clearly. Unconsciously, the corners of my mouth lifted.

<b>

Her thrust passed just beside the corner of my eye, sailing just above my ear. Then, with both her momentum and mine combined, my palm struck her chin.

<b>

"—Gah!"

<b>

Critical hit—just like that.

<b>

Alright, alright. I managed to land a solid hit on her jaw, which deals significant damage. I’m glad I practiced evasion with that lizard guy yesterday.

Now, what kind of strike should I deliver next?

<b>

As I pondered this after creating some distance, Sera-san staggered diagonally while holding her sword with one hand. Then she fell over.

<b>

"…Huh?"

<b>

With this level of damage, she should still be fine. After all, her VIT is high. But that doesn't explain the current situation.

<b>

"Ah… I see. Since this is reality, concussions and fainting can happen."

<b>

That was impossible in the game. It was just the amount of damage that varied. It seems I'm still confusing the game world with reality.

<b>

Regulus-san, who hadn't taken any damage but was staggering, came over to check on Sera-san's condition. After determining she was fine, he let out a big sigh and said with a genuinely troubled expression.

<b>

"Who the hell are you… how do you win… what am I supposed to report to Dino-sama?"

<b>

"That's not my job. By the way, Regulus-san? The declaration of the winner is still pending."

<b>

"Ah, damn it! I got it! The winner is Esuar!"

<b>

Hearing those words, I made a small fist pump with my right hand. At the same time, cheers erupted from the surrounding explorers.

<b>

<b>

"Wow! That guy is amazing! He actually beat Lady Sera!"

<b>

"Look, my hands are shaking. That skill level is insane."

<b>

"Isn't this how heroes from fairy tales were like?"

<b>

"Could it be that he’s actually the hero?"

<b>

<b>

Perhaps because Regulus-san was glaring at them, no explorers approached to speak directly, but I could hear them having such conversations.

<b>

No, no, that's not it. I'm just a former NEET.

<b>

<b>

I'm not a hero.
