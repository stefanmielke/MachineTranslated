# A-82 VS Crescent

<b>

<b>

<b>

Crescent arrived in this world two days ago.

<b>

I decided to have a match with her to teach her the 'pain' that cannot be experienced in games, but since a powerful being like her suddenly appearing in public could cause confusion, I decided to do it privately.

<b>

In that case, a dungeon with no other people would be the best option, but thanks to the connections of my powerful fiancée, I was able to reserve an arena. It wasn't my request; it was a suggestion from Pheno herself.

<b>

Crescent's existence was communicated to the royal palace through Pheno and Sera. That was yesterday.

At that time, I also asked them to explain that she is another person from a different world, and to provide her with some conveniences to make her life easier, as a message from me to His Majesty Zeno.

<b>

Well, because of that,

<b>

"Am I really going to get beaten up in front of King Zeno!?"

<b>

In the center of the stage, Crescent began to tremble like a fawn. I didn't expect this either, so cut me some slack.

<b>

Currently, in the audience, besides my party members, there are the three from Trails of Cold Steel, Mr. Regulus, His Majesty Zeno, and Prime Minister Dino, along with a few guards for security.

<b>

"You're used to fighting in front of an audience, right? Compared to Tempest, there are way fewer people. Plus, you've seen the king during the game, haven't you?"

<b>

"No, no, no! Don't confuse reality with the game! Esuar-san was probably scared at first too, right!?"

<b>

"What do you mean by 'probably'... Well, just get used to it."

<b>

"I was just brushed off!"

<b>

Crescent protested with a pout.

In her right hand, she held a crescent-shaped sword—similar in shape to a shamshir. It doesn't have special effects like my White Lotus, but it's as light as a feather and boasts the top-tier sharpness of an S-rank dungeon rare drop.

<b>

Hmm... If Crescent and I were to seriously fight, a small mistake could lead to serious injury. But then again... thinking about it, I've never fought someone with such high stats in this world, so I don't even know how damage works. Even if her VIT (Durability) is high, I have no idea how tough her skin is.

<b>

As a test, I tried to cut my fingertip with the White Lotus from my inventory—couldn't cut it.

<b>

"Is it impossible just to graze it?"

<b>

I tried cutting with a sawing motion. Thanks to the special effect of White Lotus—Shirokō—it should be easier to deal damage, but—oh, it cut a little.

<b>

"What are you doing... Trying to cut off your finger in front of a girl—it's enough to surprise a psychopath."

<b>

Crescent looked at my series of actions with the eyes of a suspicious person and let out a sigh.

To her, I licked the wound where blood had just started to surface and opened my mouth.

<b>

"I'm not trying to cut it off... I don't want to keep His Majesty and the others waiting for too long, so let's get started."

<b>

"Ugh... Watching Esuar-san's blood is making me scared, so can I use a wooden sword?"

<b>

"Oh? You intend to hit me with that? That's going to be fun."

<b>

"Yes, Crescent-chan just got a spark! You'd be mistaken if you thought I haven't grown at all since Esuar-san disappeared! I'll make sure you can't survive without an elixir!"

<b>

"That's scary."

<b>

<b>

Keeping my distance, I signaled with my eyes—match start.

By the way, neither of us is using wooden swords. The blunt conclusion that "the weapons might not withstand Esuar and the others' STR" was brought up by Mr. Regulus.

<b>

Besides, it's easier to control weapons we're used to.

<b>

For the first move, Crescent took a significant distance from me and aimed for my feet with the skill of the Breaking Sword. It seems she's trying to control her gaze so it doesn't point to where she wants to attack, but—unfortunately. After having fought many times, I can roughly tell where she's aiming based on how her body moves.

<b>

As I lightly jumped to the side to evade, the cobblestones where I had just been standing exploded with a sound.

While keeping the broken fragments in my sight, I activated the Sage's skill, Body Enhancement. I ran zigzag toward her while deploying gravity magic to her left side.

<b>

"Seriously! Can this guy see the future or something?!"

<b>

From her reaction, it seems Crescent was trying to follow the escape route I predicted.

There isn't much space behind me, so the options left are forward, up, or right. Attacking from my dominant hand side would be quite tough—she probably thinks so too,

<b>

"Forward, right?!"

<b>

"You can't keep running forever! Bring it on!"

<b>

While fiercely clashing swords, we enjoyed the conversation. When I was playing games, I would only say things like "yo" or "hey."

<b>

"Ah... it's nice to have someone who can normally deflect my attacks. Like that last attack, if it were someone from this world, it would definitely have hit."

<b>

"This person...! Even though I'm swinging my sword with all my might! What a carefree attitude!"

<b>

"Well, when I was fighting with you guys, it was usually five against one."

<b>

"That's true!"

<b>

Crescent raised her voice in response to my words. However, despite her tone and voice, the trajectory of her sword was precisely aimed at me.

<b>

<b>

Ah... this is the best.
