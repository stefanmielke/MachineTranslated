# A-85 I want to help the princess...!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

I’m tentatively planning to take it easy for about three months, but it could just as well be one month or six months. This depends on Crescent, and since my worries about "having no enemies" have significantly decreased with her arrival in this world, I’m not in a rush to conquer all the S-rank dungeons.

<b>

It might sound quite lewd when I say this, but she is really strong.

<b>

Unlike me, who has spent ten years in Tempest, and not solely dedicated to Tempest, she continues to reign first in party battles and holds the top two positions in individual rankings.

<b>

What I want to say is that if she continues to grow, she has the potential to become a threat to me. I really want her to showcase the true power of her title as a pro gamer.

<b>

"Hmm... it might be difficult every day, but once every five days should be fine. It would be a good stimulus for the other explorers. In fact, we might be able to charge the audience for it."

<b>

Today, I came to introduce Crescent to Regulus, the guild master.

The location is the usual soundproof private room, and there are three cups of tea on the table.

Regulus had come as an audience member when I had a match at the arena the other day. So he should have remembered my face, but this is the first time we’re talking face to face.

<b>

"Ah... I really don’t need the money. In fact, I have no plans to spend money, so it just keeps piling up— I don’t even know how much I have right now."

<b>

"If I had heard that line when I was in Japan, it might have made my heart flutter a bit!"

<b>

"I’d rather avoid women whose eyes turn into dollar signs."

<b>

I wonder how much I have when converted to Japanese yen. The value of elixirs is still fluctuating, and the value of other items is uncertain as well... but I probably have around a hundred billion yen.

I should be fine even if I have no income, especially since my wives are from royalty and nobility.

<b>

"Then I’ll borrow the training ground at that frequency."

<b>

"Got it. I’ll have the others become the audience during your time slots. Otherwise, we might end up with casualties from the aftermath."

<b>

Regulus shrugs as he says this.

Although he has retired as an explorer, he has recently been leveling up his primary and secondary classes a bit and seems to be acquiring status bonuses. Apparently, it’s to suppress any chaos when explorers go wild.

<b>

"I can’t help but think it’s a bit too easy to make money like this. Just getting an elixir nets two hundred thousand! If I sell other drops too, it’s even more!"

<b>

"Seems like you could live for a year with just two dives."

<b>

The elixir, which initially had an unquantifiable value, has had its price set as B-rank dungeon conquerors have started to emerge, and it has gradually dropped to twenty thousand or about two million yen now.

<b>

I don’t know if this price will stabilize or continue to drop, but I can’t understand that part since the demand and supply between Tempest and this world are different.

For me, I’m just fine if they buy it normally.

<b>

"It might be easy for you guys, but there aren’t that many who can conquer them yet. It’s just the stable clearers supplying them. The Thunderbolt Party is one of those groups."

<b>

They are currently focusing on A-rank dungeons but are also occasionally challenging B-rank Cyclopes. They’re probably being commissioned by the guild.

<b>

"Should I also make a delivery?"

<b>

When I asked this, Crescent, sitting next to me, laughed and said, "That might be impossible."

<b>

"Such commissioned requests usually have their payment amounts change based on ability. I’ve read about it in manga!"

<b>

I see.

<b>

"I don’t know the manga Crescent is talking about, but that’s how it is. The Thunderbolt Party can now safely conquer B-rank dungeons, and since the royal capital is like their home, there’s no need to summon them. Well, if it’s really necessary, I think you’d work for free."

<b>

Saying this, Regulus smirks with a nihilistic smile.

He’s probably recalling the time I saved Phenon. Back then, I was like, "Even so, I want to help the princess! Kiri!"... I don’t think of it as a dark history, but it’s a bit embarrassing.

<b>

"I wonder about that," I said, tilting my head, and Crescent called out to me with a grin, "SR-san, SR-san." After clearing his throat, he said,

<b>

"Even so, I want to help the princess."

<b>

He started saying that in a deep voice.

<b>

"W-why are you saying that—"

<b>

"It’s cool, isn’t it? Noah taught me!"

<b>

That brat is getting into unnecessary things again... I’ll have to give him a good beating when I get home...
