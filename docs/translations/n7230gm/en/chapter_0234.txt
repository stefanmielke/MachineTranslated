# A-117 First Battle

<b>

<b>

<b>

First, there’s the question of which direction to go.

Currently, we are in a place that resembles a large stone stage.

<b>

In the distance, we can see forests and mountains, or not see them—anyway, we are in a fairly spacious plain.

Since Fenon and the others are with us, it would be better to avoid the poorly visible forest. That means we should proceed across the plain.

<b>

This stone stage is large enough to serve as a landmark, so we shouldn’t get lost.

With that, the seven of us walk across the plain.

<b>

“No monsters around, huh? This is exciting!” Crescent and Hisui are cheerfully chatting. The inhabitants of this world, except for Noah, seem somewhat tense, looking around restlessly.

<b>

“You don’t need to be that nervous; we’re not going to die anyway.”

<b>

As I say this with a wry smile, Sera gives me a pointed look.

<b>

“I cannot comprehend that feeling of ‘not dying.’ Does SR know about this type of dungeon?”

<b>

…I had forgotten. Of course, they wouldn’t know the feeling of not dying.

<b>

“All the dungeons in the world where Crescent and I were are of this type. So, this dungeon might be the place where we can truly show our abilities.”

<b>

I still don’t mention that it’s a game.

I’ve conveyed that to Crescent and the others, so they agree with comments like, “It’s different when it comes to pain, though,” and “I might be more accustomed to this side too.”

<b>

Then Hisui continues and speaks up.

<b>

“But we need to investigate the damage, right? I want to properly understand how much pain it entails.”

<b>

“Then I’ll leave it to you!”

<b>

“Crescent, you’re so eager; aren’t we friends? Hisui, I’ll take on that role, so there’s no need to intentionally take hits.”

<b>

“I’m fine! It’s more educational to experience it with my own body, so I’ll take it.”

<b>

Oh wow… Well, it’s not just Hisui; Crescent would probably say something similar.

I can’t criticize them, but they both have quite the battle mindset.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“There they are.”

<b>

After walking for about ten minutes on the flat path, we spotted a pack of wolves in the distance.

They’re relatively average-sized—though they’re about twice the size of wolves seen on Earth. They appear small for a high-level dungeon.

<b>

There are five enemies—since we don’t know their strength, it’s impossible to tell if Hisui can handle them alone.

<b>

I have Sera, Fenon, and Shiri step back and leave Noah in charge while Hisui takes the lead, and Crescent and I position ourselves a bit behind, approaching the wolves.

<b>

“—Here I go!”

<b>

As the enemy noticed us, Hisui also started running toward the pack of wolves. In her hand, she held a white lotus, just like the one I usually use, and her posture was low, almost as if she were flying low.

<b>

“Looks like we’re good.”

<b>

“...Yeah, their speed is slow.”

<b>

Crescent, I, and surely Hisui understood the difference in power.

With that level of speed for wolf-type enemies… they’re probably around the level of A-rank monsters. Hisui dodges the wolves’ charges and fangs with fluid movements while dealing damage to the enemies.

<b>

It was truly overwhelming—those movements were what could be called the real Hisui.

Once again, I was able to confirm that the situation of “not dying” is an essential element for us to replicate our movements from the game era.

<b>

And when it came down to the last one, Hisui deliberately showed an opening and took a headbutt from the wolf head-on. She guarded with her arm, but her scream of “Ouch!” was clearly audible even from where we were standing.

<b>

After that, Hisui took down the last wolf as if it were a routine task.

The monster’s corpse turned into particles and rose into the sky, leaving nothing behind.

<b>

As expected, there were no drop items as per the prior information. Since Hisui’s level is capped, what she gained was merely information and experience.

<b>

“...Was Hisui that strong?”

<b>

Sera, who had come beside me without me noticing, muttered in astonishment.

<b>

“This feels like her true form.”

<b>

“So, does that mean the princess was scared until now?”

<b>

Crescent said with a smug expression. You can’t really talk, can you?

<b>

“Just so you know, you’re pretty stiff too.”

<b>

“...Aren’t you the same, SR?”

<b>

“I’m still better off.”

<b>

“No way, I’m better—oh! Didn’t the princess say before that she wants to go all out after a long time?”

<b>

Crescent said while getting closer to me—but that distance was once again widened by Sera, who stepped in between us and pushed my shoulder.

<b>

“...Our current objective is investigation, SR.”

<b>

Sera said with a sulky expression.

Could it be that she felt jealous of the close distance with Crescent...? If that’s the case, I can’t help but feel a bit happy.
