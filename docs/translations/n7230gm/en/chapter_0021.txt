# 20 His True Identity...?

Once again, this is a story from Sera's perspective.

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Myself and the trajectory of Thunderbolt arrived at the D-rank dungeon, where we operated the status window in a place out of sight and changed jobs to the one that SR mentioned.

<b>

“—? Shin and Suzu, did you just use the orb?”

<b>

In my and Laika's hands were the now ineffective and colorless job change orbs. However, Shin and Suzu were empty-handed. If I wasn't mistaken, they had only fiddled with the status window.

<b>

“Actually, when I was becoming an explorer, I was torn between being a brawler and a swordsman. So, I initially leveled up as a brawler. In the end, I went with swordsman though.”

<b>

“I’m the same as Shin. I’ve leveled up to level 15.”

<b>

“I’m at 8.”

<b>

I see. In my case, I had been training in swordsmanship since I was young, so it was a clear choice to become a swordsman, but it’s common to change jobs early on.

<b>

However, it’s unlikely that anyone would change to another lower class after gaining the status bonuses that SR mentioned.

Because once you reach level 30, you can change to a higher class. Ignoring that and starting over from level 1 in an F-rank dungeon—such a crazy explorer would be almost non-existent. Unless they were a noble like me, explorers generally aim for monetary gain.

<b>

“I’m also at level 1 like Sera-san, so let’s do our best together.”

<b>

“Yeah, that’s right, Laika. Let’s both do our best.”

<b>

Laika, who was in the same situation as me, spoke up.

It would have been even more embarrassing if I were the only one at level 1, given that I wasn’t even a member of the party. Her presence was a relief for me, who felt isolated.

<b>

“Well then, let’s go. As I said earlier, if it looks tough, don’t hesitate to use the emergency return. If what SR said is true, we probably won’t need to do that.”

<b>

Shin still seems to have doubts about SR. Suzu and Laika also don’t voice it, but they probably haven’t fully trusted him yet. The proof is that upon hearing Shin’s words, their expressions stiffened.

<b>

As for me, I also feel a fog over my trust in him. I want to believe in my heart, but since I haven’t experienced it myself, I can’t place my full trust in him.

<b>

If, as he says, it’s possible to conquer a D-rank dungeon without any issues even with a lower class, then my trust in him would surely solidify.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The first layer of the D-rank dungeon.

This dungeon is forest-type, and the monsters that appear in the first layer are goblins about 80 centimeters tall. I have painful memories of being hurt by these goblins when I was at a low level.

<b>

But how is it now?

<b>

“This is serious; SR’s story is true.”

<b>

As I watched the last goblin, the 20th one, dissipate into particles, Shin muttered as if in a daze.

<b>

The main attackers were myself and Shin.

<b>

Suzu, who had changed from priest to mage, seems to have increased her magical power and magical defense due to the status bonuses, but she can’t participate in attacks until she reaches level 25 to learn skills. Thus, she was on lookout duty.

<b>

Laika was holding a potion in one hand, waiting near me and Shin in case of an emergency, but she started participating in attacks after we had defeated half of the monsters.

<b>

“I told you so. I’m not being deceived.”

<b>

“...Yeah. It’s late to say this, but this information... isn’t it too crazy?”

<b>

“Indeed. The penalty of permanent revocation of the license feels light, even.”

<b>

“I think so too. We should be grateful to SR for sharing this with us.”

<b>

How unreasonable the information brought by SR is.

Now that they are convinced that his words are true, they are finally starting to break out in a cold sweat.

<b>

I’m acting calm, but in reality, my hand holding the sword is faintly trembling.

After all, the common sense I had until now has been overturned by the appearance of just one person. This era—this very moment may be spoken of later as a turning point in history.

Perhaps he himself doesn’t clearly understand how valuable this information is.

<b>

...No, more than that, I must hurry to obtain the elixir. Fenon’s life is running out. If I have time to think, I should be doing what I can now.

<b>

“SR entrusted us with conquering from the first layer to the fifth layer. If we’re going to be grateful, let’s level up properly and make it in time by the deadline.”

<b>

At my words, both Suzu and Laika nodded.

<b>

“Why are you the one taking charge?”

<b>

Shin said with a wry smile.

<b>

Don’t laugh! It’s my first time forming a party, so it’s natural that I’m more motivated than usual!

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

Six days after starting to level up our lower classes, all of our levels surpassed 30. We achieved this by evening, so currently, we are at a tavern in the royal capital.

<b>

“For now, we’ve achieved our goal, so cheers!”

<b>

“““Cheers!”””

<b>

With a shout, we clinked our glasses together and took a sip of our respective drinks.

Shin and I had ale. Laika had wine, and Suzu had fruit juice.

<b>

“It’s good that we finished ahead of schedule, but the real test is just beginning. Tomorrow, let’s focus on coordination including Sera. Also, you haven’t conquered a C-rank dungeon yet, right?”

<b>

“Yeah. I’m counting on you.”

<b>

When I said that, Suzu replied, “You don’t have to worry about it.” Then she asked with a serious expression.

<b>

“More importantly, what about SR? Who exactly is he?”

<b>

“Well... to be honest, I don’t know much either.”

<b>

I know he’s from another world, but I have no idea how that relates to his knowledge.

Of course, I won’t mention that he’s from another world since I’ve been told to keep it a secret.

<b>

“To be honest, it’s abnormal. Doesn’t everyone notice? Aside from the bonus, his knowledge is incredible.”

<b>

At Suzu’s question, Shin and Laika tilted their heads.

I also didn’t understand what she was talking about.

<b>

“Sera-san has fought against SR in a mock battle, right?”

<b>

“Yeah. I got completely crushed.”

<b>

“Have you seen him fight anyone else?”

<b>

“Well... no. Why do you ask?”

<b>

When I asked that, Suzu answered with a serious expression.

<b>

“For Sera-san, there was only that one mock battle. We’ve only told him our current levels and the highest floors we’ve reached. Yet, he deduced the number seven. If Shin and I were at level 1, it would have taken all of us until tomorrow night to reach level 30. It’s just too precise.”

<b>

Now that you mention it... that’s certainly true.

After hearing Suzu’s words, everyone fell silent. She continued.

<b>

“Even for us who have been explorers for years, it’s impossible to grasp that accurately. It makes me wonder if he’s some kind of god or something.”

<b>

Hmm. There’s certainly some truth to that—but—

<b>

“If that were the case, would he really come down to the lower world as a level 1? And if he were a god, he should be able to easily create an elixir.”

<b>

“...That’s true.”

<b>

Both I and Suzu, as well as Shin and Laika, crossed our arms and pondered. Who exactly is he?

After a while, Laika seemed to remember something and exclaimed, “Oh!”

<b>

“Speaking of which, when he was talking about being ‘competitive,’ he said, ‘Even if everything is taken from me, I won’t fall.’ Could it be that he was originally a very powerful explorer? Perhaps something caused him to revert to level 1?”

<b>

“If that were the case, someone should at least know his name or appearance.”

<b>

“Yeah...”

<b>

Once again, the four of us crossed our arms and thought.

After that, various speculations flew around, such as him being a person from the future or past, an apostle of a god, or a hero. However, none of them led to any certainty, and we didn’t come to a conclusion until the gathering eventually broke up.

<b>

It’s clear that he is not a hero, but I deliberately chose not to voice that. If I talked about it, it would naturally reveal that he is from another world.

<b>

As we were discussing whether to head home soon, Shin asked me.

<b>

“By the way, how was your mock battle with SR? I heard you couldn’t even lay a hand on him, but how did that go?”

<b>

He looked very interested and leaned slightly forward.

<b>

“Well... I was so tense that I don’t remember the details well, but basically, I couldn’t land a hit.”

<b>

Even now, I think his movements were completely without waste. While I was attacking with a power of 10, he was dodging with a power of 1—that’s how it felt.

<b>

“Hmm. Speaking of which, I heard he was training his evasion against the boss of a C-rank dungeon—wait, could that be true too?”

<b>

“Now it seems likely to be true.”

<b>

I nodded at the two and continued with the story of the mock battle.

<b>

“It felt like I was about to hit him, but I couldn’t. There was one time he stepped forward at the same time as my attack, dodging it and striking my jaw with his palm. I lost consciousness from that one hit.”

<b>

“—Ah, so that’s why you said you couldn’t do anything.”

<b>

“Is he good at counterattacks, I wonder?”

<b>

Laika said, and I replied, “I think so.”

<b>

“After all, before the match, he kept taunting me, saying I looked ‘weak.’ He himself said he finds it easier to fight when he’s on the offensive.”

<b>

If I don’t attack, I can’t win. But if I do attack, I’ll be countered.

I couldn’t imagine a scene where I would win against him, who couldn’t be hit at all.

<b>

Then, Suzu spoke up.

<b>

“I’m looking forward to seeing how he fights against monsters. After all, monsters are universally aggressive.”

<b>

At her words, the other three, including myself, gasped.

<b>

I had been acting alongside him, but of course, I had never seen him fight against monsters, nor had I seen him fight from an objective standpoint.

Just how would he, with such knowledge and combined skills and talent, fight?—I wanted to see it, yet at the same time, I was scared to see it.
