# A-46 Movement, Fatigue

<b>

<b>

About two months have passed since the match that stirred up the world—mainly the realm of explorers.

They say that rumors last for seventy-five days, but unfortunately, the prominent events weren't just the matches in the arena; there was also the grand celebration of the wedding between Phenon and Sera, which meant that my days of being exposed to people's gazes would likely continue for a while longer.

Even though I was prepared for it, having my attention drawn like this for so long was mentally taxing. The only solace I found was in the dungeons where I didn't have to worry about curious stares.

<b>

During these two months, I had numerous meetings with Phenon's family, visited the Earl of Bernot's residence, received the title of "Conqueror" from His Majesty, and was almost granted a territory. Of course, I declined the territory. It was far too troublesome.

I understand that there might be a desire to keep me tied to this country, but I would prefer political discussions to be held elsewhere.

<b>

After that, a grand wedding took place, overshadowing the memories of the matches in the arena, and we, ASR, requested the contractors to expand and renovate the building. Then, as if escaping from the noisy Kingdom of Lindale, we set off in a carriage towards the neighboring country of Palmour.

<b>

<b>

Riding in a lavishly decorated carriage, we passed through several villages and towns with the knights on guard, entering the territory of the Kingdom of Palmour without any particular incidents.

After passing through more towns, it ended up taking us five days just for the travel. I might have underestimated the reality of moving. In a game, you could easily teleport, but—well, there's no point in being selfish about it.

<b>

"Ouch... But still, everyone is amazing. Doesn't it hurt after being jostled in a carriage for such a long time?"

<b>

The luxurious carriage shook and rattled. The capital of the Kingdom of Palmour finally came into view, albeit vaguely.

On either side of me were Sera and Phenon, while Noah and Shiri sat across from us. The other four wore expressions of ease, while I grimaced in discomfort.

Shiri, seeing me rubbing my waist, chuckled and spoke up.

<b>

"I don't know how many vehicles you are familiar with, but this carriage has the least amount of shaking in the world, and the place where we are seated has precious cushioning materials used, you know? For me, it's quite comfortable."

<b>

At Shiri's statement, Sera nodded as if to say, "That's right." Surely, the carriages Sera had ridden before were of a lower quality than those used by royalty.

Is this what they consider comfortable...? I wish the inhabitants of this world could experience a month riding in a car on Earth and share my suffering.

<b>

By the way, why is Noah seemingly unaffected?

He was originally a god, and he shouldn't be accustomed to vehicles in the first place.

<b>

"I'm healing myself little by little, you know."

<b>

"Hey, that's reading my mind—doesn't that feel unfair!? It's not like I'm injured or anything! Does it even work!?"

<b>

"It's more like I'm continuously taking weak damage rather than my stamina being depleted. The healing works properly."

<b>

"You should have told me that earlier..."

<b>

I never expected to find out about this on the last day of our travel...

Perhaps it's because my attention has been focused on Phenon and Sera lately that he's sulking, but if he's going to tease me, I wish it would be in a way that doesn't cause physical damage.

<b>

Noah, with a slightly smug expression, turned his head away.

I think the fact that I didn't show much pain during the journey contributed to this, but if he was using it himself, he could have at least told me... I might sulk too.

<b>

Sighing, I cast a healing spell on my waist and then spoke up.

<b>

"So, when we arrive at the capital, I have to greet the kings over there, right?"

<b>

Since I had no connections in Palmour, I had essentially left all communications to the royal side.

I know it's lazy, but what can I do? I can't help it! I made excuses in my mind.

<b>

"That's tomorrow. Since we will be arriving late today, we will be staying at the accommodation prepared by them."

<b>

Shiri answered my question briskly.

Unlike sulking Noah, she seemed genuinely happy for her master's happiness. I felt like her expression had brightened even more recently. I might be overly conscious, but it seems like her body contact has increased a bit.

<b>

"Once that's over, will we be free to move around?"

<b>

"That depends on their discussions, but I don't think they will force us too much. We've mentioned that we are here for sightseeing, and we've also said that we don't need a guide."

<b>

"Well, we won't know the exact details until tomorrow. It's not like we're pressed for time, so if we can take it slow, that's fine."

<b>

Besides, unlike the capital of Lindale, the common people don't know my face.

So, I should be able to stroll through the streets without worrying about being seen.

Even Phenon, who is likely the most recognized among us as the first princess, I don't think anyone would recognize her just by changing her hair color a little without any strange disguises.

And since this is the Kingdom of Palmour, not the Kingdom of Lindale where we were active, there's a good chance they don't know about the explorer party ASR either.

<b>

"Before heading to the dungeon, we should probably stop by the guild. It's better to avoid unnecessary commotion at the reception by not showing our status. For us, it's one thing, but if Esar shows the title of Conqueror, it's like saying 'I'm the real deal.'"

<b>

"Of course, I'll go. I have a letter from Regulus, so it should be fine."

<b>

I don't know how much connection there is between the explorer guilds of different nations, but Regulus wrote me a letter saying, "If you show this at the guild in the capital, it will be fine," so at least it doesn't seem like there are any bad relations.

The explorers of this country probably don't know about us, who haven't participated in public events like the international martial arts tournament, so there shouldn't be any commotion at the guild.

As long as there aren't any people who happened to see my match in the arena at that time, we should be fine.
