Two days after talking with Serah's father, Lord Rude.

The four of us set out from the royal capital, seen off by the three members of Thunderbolt's Trail.

Our destination, of course, is the commercial city of Renas.

<b>

As with our last trip to Renas, it was a long journey by carriage.

Even though it was a long journey, if we set out in the morning, we would arrive before sunset, so it might not be too difficult for the people of this world.

Compared to traveling in Japan, it takes quite a bit of time, but unlike cars or trains, we can leisurely enjoy the scenery, so I engaged in conversation with the three while savoring the rich nature.

<b>

When we arrived in Renas at the scheduled time, the butler of the duke's family, Mr. Lorenz, welcomed us.

He was the butler who said "Thank you for your help" to Lord Drag after he broke the bottle containing the elixir.

It seems that Fenon had contacted them in advance, but to go out of his way to greet us like this... It's not necessary to go that far.

<b>

Since it was already late, and it seems that Lord Drag was preparing a party to welcome us, we decided to start looking for properties the next day. That day, we ended up having a banquet with the duke's family and concluded the day.

<b>

The next day.

<b>

"Well, I kind of knew this would happen."

<b>

As I stepped out of the real estate office, I let out a sigh.

As expected, there were no properties that met our requirements.

<b>

There were issues with the location, the bath, the number of rooms—there were countless reasons. We could compromise, but due to the whims of the three of us, excluding Shiri who said, "Why should we compromise when we have money?!" we decided to build a new house.

<b>

The problem is where to build it, but as a party, it would be better to be close to a B-rank dungeon. However, I want to level up in an A-rank dungeon on my days off, and eventually, our party will likely delve into A-rank dungeons as well.

In other words, a midpoint between an A-rank dungeon and a B-rank dungeon would be best.

<b>

"Then we should check with Duke Margus. I assume SR wants to build outside the city?"

<b>

"Does SR prefer a quieter place?"

<b>

As we walked towards the duke's residence, Serah and Fenon asked.

I do prefer quieter places, but that's not the reason this time.

<b>

"If Renas is between an A-rank dungeon and a B-rank dungeon, it would have been fine to build in the city. Besides, if we're going to build new because there are no good properties, there's no need to build far from the dungeon, right?"

<b>

It's certainly true that the view would be better than building in the city. Even though monsters exist in this world, they only inhabit dungeons, so there's no danger.

Upon hearing my words, Shiri forced a strained smile.

<b>

"So SR is dungeon-oriented, huh..."

<b>

"Huh? It's the place I go to the most, so it's only natural for an explorer, right?"

<b>

"That may be true, but I think there are few people who are as completely detached as SR. Moreover, explorers earn money by delivering drop items to the guild."

<b>

"Delivering to the guild... that was a blind spot."

<b>

Indeed, I have been delivering drop items to the guild, but it was more for the purpose of organizing my inventory than for money.

I think the magic stones and high-grade potions obtained from the B-rank dungeon were worth quite a bit, but my sense of money has completely gone awry, so I don't even remember them.

<b>

"We've been able to earn money outside of delivering to the guild."

<b>

Crossing her arms and closing her eyes, Serah said with a reflective tone.

What you're saying is correct, but don't close your eyes while walking. I won't know if you fall.

<b>

"For now, let's check with my uncle, the lord of this land—Duke Margus—and if possible, let's call a construction contractor to the duke's residence. It might take a long time, and negotiating here would be more advantageous."

<b>

No, Fenon. Even if you say home, it's the duke's residence, okay?

It's a relative's house, so maybe it's okay to say that.

<b>

"…I'll leave that part to Fenon. I'm not good at negotiations or tactics, so can I count on you?"

<b>

"Of course! Since SR has been helping me in the dungeon, I will do my best here!"

<b>

With a cheerful expression, Fenon raised her voice.

Even though I just pushed a troublesome job onto her, she seemed to be happy about it. It's a bit of a complex feeling.

<b>

<b>

Heading in the direction of the duke's residence, the four of us strolled around the city of Renas. As expected of a commercial city, the selection has changed quite a bit from a month ago.

<b>

I stopped in front of a shop that sold wooden accessories. I was just looking from a distance where the shopkeeper wouldn't notice me, with no intention of buying anything.

<b>

"Do you like wooden carvings, SR?"

<b>

Fenon asked as she peered into my face. I moved my feet again and shook my head.

<b>

"It's not that I particularly like wooden carvings, but handmade products like that were rare in my world. Well, just because they're rare doesn't mean I like them, but I prefer things with more individuality over mass-produced items."

<b>

"I see... So you like handmade things..."

<b>

Serah muttered with a serious expression.

If she were to try her hand at wooden carving, it seems like she would end up with something extremely clumsy. Just a hunch.

<b>

"Handmade, huh..."

<b>

Following Serah, Fenon also murmured something similar in a small voice.

She was looking at the wooden carving shop that we passed by as if she was plotting something.

<b>

I don't think they had a particular fondness for crafting... Did they want to try making something after seeing the items in the shop? They're quite curious.

<b>

As I felt a warm feeling watching the two of them, I noticed Shiri looking at us. Our gazes met.

<b>

"What's wrong?"

<b>

When I asked, she flinched and hurriedly waved her hands in a flustered manner.

<b>

"N-no! I was just wondering if not noticing that is a kind of talent..."

<b>

"Not noticing? Noticing what?"

<b>

"N-no, that's not it! I made a mistake! It's nothing, so please forget what I just said!"

<b>

She averted her gaze from me as if to escape, but while showing that she was concerned about us, she fixed her gaze ahead. What on earth is going on?

<b>

<b>

I watched the backs of the three walking ahead while quietly tilting my head.
