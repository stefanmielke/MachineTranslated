# 27 Reward is Despair

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next day.

<b>

After finishing breakfast, I changed into the clothes that Ms. Siri had prepared for me to meet His Majesty. It was a uniform-like outfit with white fabric and gold embroidery, reminiscent of a naval uniform.

As I lounged around, reminiscing about my days as a NEET, Thunderbolt and Ms. Sera arrived.

<b>

Their attire was no different from usual.

<b>

When I asked about it, they said they just changed because my clothes were too shabby.

Indeed, neither Ms. Sera nor Thunderbolt looked particularly slovenly. My clothes were indeed dirty and had several tears, so it was a natural decision.

<b>

Right behind them were two soldiers. They were probably guides within the castle.

Wearing full-body armor that seemed more decorative than practical, they stood completely still like statues while I chatted with them.

<b>

When I asked what was going on, it seemed they had come to call me as they were about to go to His Majesty.

<b>

"I'm not confident in etiquette or anything..."

<b>

I said to Shin while walking through the castle.

As an explorer, he might be similar to me. I was expecting a response like, "Actually, I don't know either! HAHAHA," but my wish was fleeting.

<b>

"Kneeling and bowing your head should be fine. I've met His Majesty a few times, and I wasn't reprimanded at all."

<b>

"I-I see..."

<b>

Is it okay to talk about such things with the soldier right behind me...? Unlike me, who is timid, he seems quite composed.

As I forced a wry smile, Ms. Suzu opened her mouth.

<b>

"That's right. And since you're an Esuar, a little rudeness will be forgiven. After all, you saved the princess's life."

<b>

"Haha, it's thanks to everyone's cooperation. Oh, Ms. Suzu—thanks to you, my arm and stomach are better now. I really appreciate it."

<b>

"Don't mention it."

<b>

As I lightly bowed my head to her, I caught sight of Ms. Sera's sulking face.

<b>

Why does she have that expression?

Could it be that she's sulking because I didn't thank her?

<b>

I decided to try saying something to Ms. Sera.

<b>

"Thank you for using the potion, Ms. Sera."

<b>

"Of course. It was the least I could do."

<b>

She said in a curt manner. However, her mouth twitched as if she couldn't hide her embarrassment. Eventually, she turned her face away from me, her ears slightly red.

<b>

This person is so easy to read! I can't talk, but this is terrible!

<b>

As I tried to stifle a laugh while looking at the back of her head, Ms. Laika spoke with an exasperated tone.

<b>

"I'm sorry to interrupt your fun, but we should be arriving soon. Make sure not to be rude in front of His Majesty."

<b>

"I-I'll be careful."

<b>

It seems I was caught laughing. Despite worrying about etiquette, I was surprisingly relaxed. I need to rein it in.

I slapped my cheeks lightly to regain my focus.

<b>

Now, I wonder what kind of conversation this will turn into.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"Raise your heads."

<b>

We were kneeling in front of His Majesty in the order of Ms. Sera, Ms. Suzu, Mr. Shin, Ms. Laika, and then me.

We raised our faces in response to His Majesty's words.

<b>

The last time we met was in an unofficial setting, but this time it was different. Even then, the pressure was immense, and now His Majesty was even more imposing.

<b>

Next to His Majesty was Lord Dino, and there were two royal guards nearby.

This room, about the size of a school gymnasium, contained only nine of us, including ourselves. I had expected more nobles and princes to be present, so I felt a bit relieved.

<b>

As I was thinking that, His Majesty stood up from a luxurious sofa and, to my surprise, bowed his head toward us. It was a light bow, but it still shocked me.

<b>

"First, let me express my gratitude. Thank you for saving Fenon; as a father, I am grateful."

<b>

If I were to respond with "You're welcome" here, that would be inappropriate. It would be hard to even say, "Please raise your head."

After all, it's incredibly quiet, right? I don't have the courage for that!

<b>

Glancing at Ms. Laika beside me, I saw that she was bowing her head. In fact, the three behind her were also bowing in the same manner. Huh? Is that how it goes?

<b>

I told you I didn't know the etiquette... and His Majesty bowing is way too irregular!

<b>

As I hurriedly bowed my head, a small laugh escaped from His Majesty.

<b>

"Ha, Esuar-dono, you are a hero who saved Fenon's life! There is no need to be nervous. And Thunderbolt, Sera, you are the same. Overcoming a B-rank dungeon is a historic achievement. Hold your heads high."

<b>

"「「「「Yes！」」」」「Yes!?"

<b>

As if they had rehearsed, Mr. Shin and the others responded in unison. The questioning "Huh?" that followed was mine. I was startled because I suddenly heard a loud voice from beside me.

<b>

Seeing my reaction, His Majesty laughed again.

<b>

"Hehe, please discuss the details of the dungeon conquest with Dino later. Now, let's move on to the rewards."

<b>

It seems we're going to receive something.

I don't need money; I want something like a privilege that allows me to dive into dungeons even as a first-class job.

<b>

"First, Sera Bernot. In addition to 10 million Or, you will be exempt from taxes in the Bernot territory for five years."

<b>

"I am grateful for Your Majesty's kindness."

<b>

I don't quite understand the tax exemption, but 10 million Or... that's 100 million yen!? That's incredibly generous!

<b>

After Ms. Sera, Thunderbolt and the others each received 10 million Or and the title of "Pioneers" for the party.

It seems a B-rank dungeon had been conquered before, so this title likely refers to being pioneers in this era. I have no idea how valuable that is as an outsider.

<b>

Then, it was my turn.

I was told I would receive 10 million Or, just like the other four.

<b>

"Esuar-dono. When you were summoned to this world, you said, 'I am not a hero; I am not someone who can meet expectations.'"

<b>

As His Majesty said this, Thunderbolt and the others all looked at me in surprise. I hurriedly returned to my original posture, but their expressions were pure shock.

I hadn't told them about that at all.

<b>

"But after speaking with Fenon, I realized my mistake. A 'hero' is someone brave. It is not about the profession—it is about the way one lives."

<b>

I have a very bad feeling about this. Is it just my imagination?

Unpleasant sweat trickled down my cheek and dripped from my chin.

<b>

"In less than a month, you have led Thunderbolt and Sera, some of the kingdom's strongest, to conquer a B-rank dungeon. Who else can we call a hero if not you, Esuar-dono?"

<b>

See? I knew it!

<b>

I was certain this was the kind of thing I would be told!

No, that's not true! I'm not that great of a person!

I'm just a NEET who got a little too hooked on a game!

<b>

Besides, I didn't lead them! They just cooperated with me!

<b>

Whether His Majesty knew my feelings or not, he smiled slyly. Then he opened his mouth.

<b>

"I bestow upon you the title of 'Hero.'"

<b>

At that moment, my heart sank into despair.

My desire to not stand out was completely crushed.

<b>

Wasn't this supposed to be a reward...? I cursed silently in my heart as I spoke to His Majesty.

<b>

"I-I am truly honored."

<b>

I bowed my head and offered words of thanks that held no sincerity.

<b>

My mental state wasn't strong enough to refuse in this situation.

How could I say, "No, that's fine," to something given with such goodwill by the nation's leader?

<b>

Sigh... how did it come to this?
