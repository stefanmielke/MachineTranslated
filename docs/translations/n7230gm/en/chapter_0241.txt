# A-124 The Cost of Experimentation

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Whether it's fortunate or unfortunate, the members like Sera, Phenon, and Shiri were not rushing to the new dungeon in the middle of the night; they were still in their dreams.

<b>

Noah briefly explained the outline to Regulus and then immediately fled when it seemed like a lecture was about to begin. Well, Regulus probably couldn't scold Noah, the former creator god, too harshly anyway, so it's fine. No, it's not that we accepted being scolded.

<b>

"SR, you should properly recognize your own worth. What would you have done if the dead in this dungeon did not come back to life?"

<b>

"But someone has to do that role anyway, and the people who can enter that dungeon are limited, right?"

<b>

"That's simple; just restrain the person sentenced to death and take them to the S-rank dungeon before bringing them here."

<b>

Wow, Regulus is saying something scary that perfectly matches his intimidating face.

Hisuishi is shrinking back in fear, right? Crescent is whispering, "I hadn't thought of that."

<b>

Well, I do think that was one way to go about it.

<b>

"But that's what Lord Idea said, right? Are you saying you don't believe in the gods of my world, Regulus?"

<b>

"…I didn't say that. It's not that I don't believe, but just in case—"

<b>

"Just in case, Lord Idea might fail?"

<b>

"…I'll hit you."

<b>

"That's scary!"

<b>

It's probably a hit dog that barks. I should stop teasing any further. Hisuishi looks scared. Crescent is laughing, though.

<b>

"Anyway, consult me about such things in advance. Also, I will tell your wives about this. You should expect to be scolded more than by me."

<b>

"…(Suu)"

<b>

"Hahaha! Thanks to you, the value of elixirs has already plummeted, so there's no way I could be bribed with something like this."

<b>

I thought maybe if I gave him an elixir, he would stay quiet, but that didn't work. That's right; the value of this is no longer what it used to be. It seems that the number of people who have cleared B-rank dungeons is increasing rapidly.

<b>

Now, how should I apologize to everyone tomorrow?

<b>

The next morning. Having woken up late due to working late into the night, I found myself surrounded by three people trembling with anger before I could even say good morning. They were sitting on my bed, bowing their heads.

<b>

That's strange. I thought there were only my parents and security personnel in this party house, so why are these three here?

<b>

"I sincerely apologize."

<b>

"Did you think about how we would feel if SR had died? You wouldn't say you didn't think about it at all, would you?"

<b>

"SR-san, I'm angry too. Why didn't you consult me even once? If you were troubled, I wanted you to talk to me."

<b>

"At times like that, please use me. I'm begging you."

<b>

Sera, Phenon, and Shiri are each attacking me. Well, they might not be intending to attack, but they are certainly piercing my heart with their words.

<b>

"I'm sorry."

<b>

"Honestly— I thought I knew SR liked dungeons, but I didn't expect it to be to this extent. I was chilled to the bone when I saw the letter from the guild master that arrived this morning."

<b>

Now I understand why they came this morning— that guild master really did tell on me as declared. What an unnecessary thing...!

<b>

"It's true. Please take better care of yourself. If SR were to pass away, I would follow after you, you know? Please keep that in mind from now on."

<b>

Phenon is scary too... I'm happy to be loved, but still.

And of course, this isn't the end.

<b>

After being made to say "I'll be more careful from now on" repeatedly, I went down to the living room, where my smiling parents greeted me.

That's right; this is where the real ordeal begins...

<b>

"Shui, you understand, right?"

<b>

"You do understand, don't you?"

<b>

"Yes..."

<b>

Having been told that by my parents, who were smiling frighteningly, I sat down on the spot in a flowing motion. By the way, I don't know if Sera and the others sensed the atmosphere or if they genuinely intended to leave, but they said, "We're going to Crescent and Hisuishi," and left the party house.

<b>

I thought maybe Crescent and the others would just end up being scolded by Regulus, but it seems Sera and the others are going to get angry at them too.

<b>

Well, even though they ultimately agreed to defeat Noah, Hisuishi was trying to die herself. I reported that to Regulus. Sorry.

<b>

Conclusion.

<b>

Sera and the others' lecture ended in an hour, but my parents' lecture lasted for three hours. It was a bit scary that they kindly took a bathroom break in between.
