# A-83 After this, I got really beat up

<b>

<b>

<b>

About fifteen minutes into the match.

For a while, I was enjoying the battle with Crescent, but the true purpose of this match is to make her understand pain, and the audience isn't just made up of close friends, so I can't just do as I please.

<b>

It's about time to change the flow of the match.

<b>

“--- Hey there, you weren't thinking about what comes next, were you?”

<b>

Crescent defended against my sword while jumping back, but with my next move, her sword was knocked away. Although she didn't let go, she was lifted up and momentarily deprived of her freedom.

In that gap, I kicked her in the stomach.

<b>

“Gah—”

<b>

It wasn't a roundhouse kick or a moonsault, just a simple kick. However, it was a serious kick powered by my stats. My shin dug into her abdomen, and Crescent was sent flying as if it were nothing, so lightly that it made getting hit by a truck seem cute.

<b>

Her stats are high too, so she probably won't be incapacitated by this single blow. Even though the attack landed on her unguarded stomach, it's questionable whether it even cracked a bone.

<b>

But――,

<b>

“--- Gah, ugh”

<b>

She was on all fours, groaning in pain. If this were a ranking match, she would have been decapitated and disqualified in an instant. Well, since this is her first time taking serious damage, it's understandable that she'd react this way――huh?

<b>

“Oh, you got back up”

<b>

“Y-yeah, this much is normal. I'm totally fine”

<b>

“Your legs are shaking, aren't they?”

<b>

“It's just battle jitters”

<b>

“That's a pretty common excuse. Can you keep going?”

<b>

When I asked her that, she rubbed her stomach, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath.

<b>

“--- Huuuu… I have to do this, or it won't mean anything. I can't waste the opportunity that SR-san has given me”

<b>

“Well, even if you didn't want to, I was probably going to keep going a bit longer. It's something that needs to be done eventually”

<b>

But what’s with that tone of yours? It's too normal and lacks character. Where's your usual “ssu”?

<b>

“Hehe, is the S in SR for Sadist?”

<b>

“No, it's just the initial of my real name”

<b>

“Oh, by the way, can I ask for your name?”

<b>

Is she forgetting that we're in the middle of a match? Well, whatever.

But a name… I definitely wouldn't have said it in-game, but since I'm in another world, I guess privacy doesn't matter.

<b>

“It's Rokudo, Rokudo Shuui. And you, Crescent?”

<b>

“So SR… it’s straightforward, huh?”

<b>

“Shut up. Just tell me your name too”

<b>

“Alright, I'm Tohno Mitsuki”

<b>

Crescent said her name while scratching her cheek a bit shyly. You're not exactly being subtle either.

<b>

“Mitsuki, crescent moon, so Crescent, huh? You can't really criticize others, can you?”

<b>

“Better than someone's initials”

<b>

“It's fine. Everyone confuses it with Super Rare or Sniper Rifle anyway—well, just for clarity, let's stick with SR here. I'm living as SR in this world now. The Rokudo Shuui from Earth is already dead.”

<b>

“That's true… Tohno Mitsuki is gone too”

<b>

While staring at her palm, Crescent said. She's probably comparing it to her palm from Earth. It seems she's trying to understand that this body belongs to someone else.

Well, more importantly.

<b>

“Let's stop chatting for now. For now, I plan to beat you up until you lose consciousness. I feel bad about it, but I don't want someone from my hometown to die in a dungeon.”

<b>

“Is this the whip of love, then?”

<b>

“Please don't say ‘love’… Someone might get angry.”

<b>

“Ugh… doesn't the princess say anything?”

<b>

“She might feel a bit jealous, but I can see her saying my feelings come first.”

<b>

“You're loved, huh… Well, since you're the hero who saved lives and the world, it's not surprising that you'd be popular.”

<b>

Compared to my previous life as a NEET, it's a fact that I'm way more popular. Moreover, the partners are royalty and nobility, which is quite something. If I can marry such a beauty, then it was worth risking my life to save the world.

<b>

Of course, I didn't work hard just for that. But seriously,

<b>

“Hey, are you trying to stall for time?”

<b>

“Ah, ahahaha… there's no way I would do that!”

<b>

After this, I really beat her up badly.
