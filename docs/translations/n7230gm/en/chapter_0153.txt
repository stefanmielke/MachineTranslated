# A-38 Opening

<b>

<b>

<b>

For a few days after the match schedule was decided, I spent my time doing light exercises, practicing with the members of Thunder's Trail and ASR, and diving into dungeons.

<b>

There was nothing different from my usual daily life.

<b>

However, ten days before the match, the Kingdom of Lindale finally announced that "a challenge to SS rank will be held by those who have conquered S rank dungeons."

<b>

I don't know where the leak came from, but it seems that it is already known that I am the dungeon conqueror, and in no time, I became as famous as a Hollywood star. Thanks to that, when I go out into the city, disguises have become a must.

<b>

<b>

And then, ten days later.

<b>

<b>

"I wonder what will happen after the match. They say that rumors last for seventy-five days, but how long will it take for things to quiet down in this case?"

<b>

In the players' waiting room inside the arena.

My opponent, the party of "Moon," is eagerly waiting for me on stage, so I am the only player waiting.

<b>

That said, there are not just players in this room.

<b>

"Haah... ASR is so carefree... It's my heart that feels like it's going to explode from cheering."

<b>

Please don't talk about your heart exploding. That's too gruesome.

<b>

"Well, you're my big brother after all."

<b>

"It does seem like something that would be typical of ASR."

<b>

At Serah's words, Noah and Phenon reacted, and right next to them, Shiri nodded in agreement.

<b>

Just a little while ago, Thunder's Trail, the Vinzett siblings, and Regulus-san had also come, but when it was thirty minutes before the scheduled match time, they seemed to consider the ASR members and left after offering their words of encouragement.

<b>

The current time is 12:35.

I am scheduled to enter the stage at 13:00.

<b>

I am clad in my battle gear, the "Black Coffin," and I can fight at any time as soon as I take out the White Lotus from my inventory.

<b>

"At this point, there's nothing I can do, and I don't think about running away now. Well, even Lady Idea probably doesn't intend to kill me."

<b>

--This is my tentative insurance.

If I lose, my pride will be torn to shreds in front of a large audience, and the possibility of marriage with Phenon and Serah may drift further away.

<b>

I smiled at the party members who looked anxious and continued, "Don't make such faces."

<b>

"Either way, if they said it would end at S rank dungeons, I would have been dissatisfied. So I'm glad that a worthy opponent has appeared."

<b>

"In the world where ASR exists, the strongest party... It seems that ASR himself has never won against them, right?"

<b>

Guh... Don't casually say things that I care about.

<b>

"Well, I haven't won, but that was before I became the Overlord."

<b>

If I fought now, I wouldn't lose! I can win!

<b>

"Since ASR is challenging five opponents alone, it's inherently unfair."

<b>

With a somewhat sulky expression, Phenon said that.

It's a hopeful observation, but it seems like they are angry for my sake.

I appreciate the sentiment, but--

<b>

"That's because I challenged them on my own accord. I don't intend to complain about that."

<b>

"You're a battle maniac, aren't you? Also, you love thrills?"

<b>

"I'd rather not be aware of it, so please don't say that."

<b>

As I sighed and said that, everyone chuckled softly. What a hassle.

<b>

<b>

As we were casually chatting like that, I heard a knock on the door. It seems it's time for my turn.

<b>

"ASR-sama. Please prepare for your entrance."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

I replied to the knight who came to call me and slowly stood up from my chair, placing my hands on my knees.

<b>

"Good luck!"

<b>

"You'll be fine, ASR-san!!"

<b>

"Let's have a party after it's over!!"

<b>

"I believe in you!"

<b>

Noah, Phenon, Shiri, Serah.

Each of them offered words of encouragement as I headed towards the match.

Their expressions are bright. They probably have some anxiety, but they are surely trying not to let it show.

<b>

Well then, I should respond with some confident words.

<b>

"Alright. I'll show you a battle at the top that this world has yet to see."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"---And everyone, do not forget this day. Etch it into your eyes and soul. His name is ASR. The title bestowed upon the strongest on the surface, prepared by the gods, and the only profession---the Overlord, a remarkable being crowned with that name!!"

<b>

After I arrived at the stage in the arena, Emperor Xeno's greeting began. It seems he is using a magic tool for amplification, as he spoke with a voice loud enough to drown out the surrounding commotion.

<b>

Wow, this is really embarrassing.

<b>

I had heard that there was a further divine revelation from Lady Idea to the Emperor, and that my introduction would be done according to that revelation... but I did not expect this.

<b>

However, this might lead some to think that the Overlord profession can be obtained by defeating me. It's incredibly embarrassing, but I can't help but call it a nice assist.

<b>

If this prompts someone to train desperately and challenge me, that would be fantastic.

Whether they are mediocre or a genius, or even a rare talent among a hundred million people---I want them to put in their utmost effort.

<b>

I am already in a position where I am training in an environment where I can reset the game as many times as I want, granted a cheat called "Eye of Origin" that allows foresight from the gods, and I hold the Overlord profession that allows the use of all skills. Ordinary effort won't be enough to beat me.

<b>

...In fact, if I lose after all this, it would be even more embarrassing.

<b>

Thanks to the Emperor's speech-like greeting, the excitement in the venue reached its peak. It's noisy.

Not only the audience but also the number of security personnel present seems to be extraordinary. It seems that about 20% of the total are related to security.

Given that representatives from various countries and participants of the international martial arts tournament are gathered, it's understandable, but since they have come to the venue, I wish they would show some interest in my match. It's a bit lonely.

<b>

"Indeed, there are many people... but compared to Tempest, the audience is several times smaller. Over there, you could watch even if you weren't in the venue."

<b>

Muttering such a thing, I received a signal from a nearby knight and began to walk towards the stage.

<b>

I touched the transparent membrane with my right hand, and with a light push, I was able to slip inside. In front of me stood five people dressed entirely in black, lined up in a row like mannequins in a department store, not moving a muscle.

<b>

Once I entered the membrane, the surrounding noise that had been in an uproar due to the enemy's appearance vanished as if it were a lie. It seems that the sound outside the membrane is blocked.

<b>

I took out my beloved sword, the White Lotus, from my inventory, and after taking a few steps forward without any pressure, I stopped.

Then, right at the midpoint between me and Moon, a ring appeared that seemed to be reading data, spinning around. The number "10" floated in the center.

<b>

That number became 9, then 8, then 7.

<b>

"It's a fateful showdown. I never thought I'd be able to fight even after coming to another world. Nice to meet you---but I guess you won't react anyway."

<b>

And then, the number eventually became 1---

<b>

"Well, let's have fun."

<b>

The curtain rises on the ultimate battle between Earth and another world.
