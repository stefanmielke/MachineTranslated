# 35 No matter how you look at it, that's going too far

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Finally, the announcement is here."

<b>

While delicately picking up a cookie from the table with her fingertips, Ms. Phenon said.

<b>

The location is, as always, my house.

<b>

Living in this somewhat isolated place has become easier over time. The bed is fluffy, and it somehow becomes clean without me having to do any cleaning, and in terms of security, it's top-notch. After all, there's a house within the castle grounds.

<b>

"The town must be in an uproar right now. Especially the guild must be in a tough spot."

<b>

In response to Ms. Phenon, Sera replied.

<b>

As they said, today the derived secondary jobs—and their job change methods—are being announced.

In addition, it will be revealed that the Thunderbolt's Trail is the discoverer of the profession, that a B-rank dungeon has been conquered by five people including me and Sera, and—about the title.

<b>

Ms. Phenon told me that this announcement was made in a way to minimize attention on me.

Since the announcement of the title must be made, it was best to present it while everyone is focused on the profession—she said.

<b>

And with the announcement of the derived secondary jobs, the regulations for diving into dungeons will also change. This is a rule I have been attending meetings to decide.

Sera's comment about the "guild being in trouble" is related to this. They will have to explain it to the explorers.

<b>

"But is it really okay to dive into E-rank and D-rank dungeons with lower-tier jobs?"

<b>

With a worried expression, Ms. Shiri said.

<b>

"It'll be fine. I've made it reasonably safe, and to be honest, the previous rules were more dangerous."

<b>

"? Where's the danger in that?"

<b>

With a puzzled expression, Ms. Shiri tilted her head. Sera and Ms. Phenon also had similarly confused looks.

It may have been safe until now, but it will be different from here on out.

<b>

The reason the previous rules were dangerous—it's easy to explain.

<b>

"As long as you clear an F-rank dungeon, you can dive into an E-rank dungeon just by being a higher-tier job."

<b>

As I said this, Sera immediately interjected.

<b>

"What's wrong with that? To become a higher-tier job, you have to level up a lower-tier job to level 30, and even at level 1, you inherit the skills of the lower-tier job. You should have some combat experience."

<b>

She's right.

<b>

If the people in this world don't learn about derived secondary jobs or status bonuses, that rule wouldn't have been a problem.

After all, they struggle in B-rank dungeons.

<b>

"There's the job change orb, right?"

<b>

Since I suddenly started talking about that, Sera responded with a puzzled look, "It's a drop from E-rank dungeons."

<b>

"That orb drops in A-rank dungeons too."

<b>

"It drops in A-rank dungeons? Why would such a cheap item drop—"

<b>

Just as she was about to say that, Sera's mouth stopped moving. Her eyes widened, and she froze with a stunned expression. What she probably predicted in her mind was likely correct.

<b>

In place of the frozen Sera, Ms. Phenon asked.

<b>

"Could it be that the higher-tier job orbs drop...?"

<b>

"That's correct."

<b>

Yes, in A-rank dungeons, orbs for six jobs other than derived secondary jobs—swordmaster, warrior, heavy knight, priest, mage, and divine archer—drop.

<b>

If you use those orbs, according to the previous rules, you could enter an E-rank dungeon with almost no combat experience and no status bonuses. Even though your ability values would be exactly the same as a level 1 lower-tier job.

<b>

Looking at the three of them with expressions of shock, I continued speaking.

<b>

"Therefore, the change in rules was necessary either way. Well, we will level all lower-tier jobs to 30, so we won't have the opportunity to use the orbs."

<b>

When I said that, Sera let out a sigh as if she was exasperated.

<b>

"…Esuar, is your mouth some kind of surprise box? I wish you would speak with a bit more of a serious atmosphere when discussing major secrets."

<b>

"Hm? There's still more to tell, you know? Want to hear it all?"

<b>

"…No, let's skip it for today."

<b>

Seeing Sera's troubled expression, I laughed, "Hahaha."

<b>

"But I'll be talking about it eventually, so just be prepared for that—I'll also share various things with Ms. Phenon and Ms. Shiri, but please keep this just between us."

<b>

"Of course. If you, Esuar-sama, say so, we will prioritize it above all else. Even if it results in execution, we don't mind!"

<b>

"No, that's not okay."

<b>

How straightforward is this princess… Is this the effect of being a lifesaver?

I'm glad, but it's still a bit scary.

<b>

I smiled wryly and tossed a cookie into my mouth.

Little by little, I feel like I'm getting closer to Ms. Phenon. Conversations with Ms. Shiri are also smooth, and we've become quite friendly.

<b>

Leveling up derived secondary jobs and collecting drops from that dungeon... I'm looking forward to what comes next.

<b>

☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆

<b>

<b>

Around noon the day after the announcement, Sera and I were heading to the Explorer's Guild to see if there were any issues with the new regulations.

<b>

I didn't mind going alone, but it seems Ms. Phenon had finished leveling up her primary job and wanted to check on the guild as well.

<b>

"Wow... there are still so many people here."

<b>

"What a huge crowd... I feel like I'm going to get sick."

<b>

As we walked closer, both of us sighed at the sight before us.

<b>

The entrance of the guild was blocked by people, and there were crowds of people surrounding the building. It seemed that even explorers who usually don't use the guild were gathering, and they were all unfamiliar faces.

<b>

As we got close enough to recognize their faces, I locked eyes with a rugged-looking man.

He turned his gaze from me to Sera, and as if he realized something, he shouted, "Ahh!"

<b>

"That's them! I recognize the daughter of the count! The guy next to her is that Esuar or whatever!"

<b>

As the man shouted, the explorers who had been gathered around the guild all turned their attention towards us.

The man who called my name came running over. A crowd of other explorers followed behind him like a gaggle of onlookers.

<b>

Ah, I don't want this. It's probably about the title or something, right? I guess I'll just brush it off casually.

<b>

"Are you Esuar?"

<b>

"Yes, that's me."

<b>

As I answered, the man's gaze suddenly sharpened. It was a look that felt like it could shoot me down with a glare.

<b>

"You seem to be enjoying quite a sweet deal, huh? You two must have just stuck to Shin's brothers and conquered the B-rank dungeon, right? Getting a title while being like a goldfish's remora..."

<b>

Ah... I see. From their perspective, that's how it looks.

<b>

Of course, both Sera and I have only recently become explorers.

On top of that, only the Thunderbolt's Trail has been announced as the discoverer of the derived secondary jobs.

It's only natural that they might think we just accompanied them.

<b>

As I pondered how to convince them, I decided to talk casually.

<b>

"Yes, we did receive a title. So what?"

<b>

"Hmph—you're probably getting a lot of money too, right? How much?"

<b>

"I can't tell you that."

<b>

Because it's a hassle. If I said I received 10 million orls, it would probably cause another uproar.

<b>

Wondering if they were angry because they felt belittled, I glanced over at Sera, who was looking down with her fists clenched.

She was biting her lips tightly, and I could see her face contorting in frustration through her bright red hair.

<b>

She wants to retort, but can't.

<b>

It seemed like she was struggling with that.

I thought she would shout, "Don't look down on me!" but... I wonder what's wrong.

<b>

"Sigh..."

<b>

This is annoying. Very annoying. Why do I have to deal with these guys so early in the morning?

<b>

As I sighed, countless jeers flew in from the surroundings.

<b>

"You guys are cheating! If I had followed Thunderbolt's Trail, I could have become a B-rank dungeon conqueror too!"

<b>

"Don't get cocky, newbie who just registered!"

<b>

"We've been explorers for over ten years! Don't let a rookie step in!"

<b>

"Don't mess with us!"

<b>

"You bastard!"

<b>

"No one recognizes your title!"

<b>

"I don't care if you're a noble's daughter; you probably threatened your brothers! You're just a goldfish's remora!"

<b>

Such arbitrary words echoed around us. The jeers called for more jeers, and soon it became a commotion where it was impossible to discern who was saying what.

<b>

<b>

No matter how much jealousy or resentment they felt, that's going too far.

<b>

<b>

It's understandable that they have grievances against me suddenly appearing—but Sera has surely worked hard just like the other explorers.

She practices swinging outside while I'm diving into dungeons, you know? How can they call her a goldfish's remora?

<b>

"…You bastards—"

<b>

Not caring what happens next—I felt my patience snap and was about to raise my voice when—

<b>

"What’s all this commotion?!"

<b>

A deep voice that had recently shaken my eardrums echoed around us. The jeering voices all stopped at once, and silence fell.

<b>

When I turned my gaze toward the source of the voice, there stood H… Regulus, looking furious.
