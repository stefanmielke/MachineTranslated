After finishing the first match, which I showcased to Neska and Niz, I started the next battle with the intention of taking my time.

<b>

With all player bonuses obtained and being a third-tier class—especially using White Lotus—my attack power was probably too different from hers to be a reference. However, fighting without holding back still feels good, so I'm grateful to have the opportunity.

<b>

For the second match, I decided to challenge it with unarmed combat. Since I was asked to show my fighting skills, I felt it would be a bit rude to only do that.

<b>

"Here we go."

<b>

While a complete evasion would be fine, this time I decided to proceed by deflecting attacks.

I avoided the enemy's claws while using the momentum of their attacks to convert it into my own power. It somewhat resembles Aikido, but since I have no experience in that, it's hard to judge.

I'm not particularly skilled at evasion, so I can't really tell if it looks good in their eyes... but it should be fine. It's still a matter of being able to defeat them without any danger.

<b>

"The moment you see your opponent's movement to attack, you can somewhat predict what kind of attack will come, where it will come from, and how much power it will have—so you respond accordingly."

<b>

While explaining this verbally, I struck the enemy's shoulder with a palm strike.

<b>

"—And let's make sure not to miss any openings. When dealing with monsters, they generally won't try to deceive you, but human battles are a different matter."

<b>

I delivered a roundhouse kick aimed at the enemy's jaw during their stagger. If I were to do this with my body from when I was on Earth, my leg wouldn't have been able to rise this high. In fact, my semicircular canals would probably fail me and I'd feel dizzy.

<b>

Finally, I transformed the enemy into particles with a heel drop and walked toward the place where the four were waiting.

<b>

"How was that? Did it help as a reference?"

<b>

I asked Neska and Niz, but they responded with a dazed silence.

Instead, my companions spoke up.

<b>

"Indeed, SR is terrifyingly strong even without weapons. I'm sure anyone seeing it for the first time would believe that's your main strength."

<b>

"Yeah, yeah. Since big brother is always in close combat, it seems like you've gotten used to it without realizing."

<b>

Noah, who knows about my past during the game, accurately points out the reason I can fight unarmed. In her case, it's not so much that she guessed; it's only natural since she's been watching me all along.

<b>

After a while, Neska, recovering from her state of shock, was the first to murmur, "Amazing." Then she nodded in admiration.

<b>

"It truly seems to me that there is no waste in your movements."

<b>

"Ahaha, thank you very much for that. But I still think there's room for improvement... I tend to focus on the sword, so my weight distribution gets drawn towards that."

<b>

While I can adjust the obvious aspects like reach, I believe there are still finer points that can be improved.

The same goes for the sword. I’m sure I can still get stronger.

<b>

"What are you going to do if you get any stronger, SR...?"

<b>

With a wry smile, Sera said that. Even if you ask me what I'm going to do... I wonder what I will do? I don't know either. Maybe defeat Venom again?

<b>

"I'd like you to stop that because it's bad for my heart."

<b>

Noah said with a similarly bitter expression.

Well, it's a matter of life and death. I'll be careful.

<b>

And stop reading my mind without permission!

<b>

After that, we tackled the A-rank dungeon with one of our ASR members acting as a guard while two others proceeded with the extermination.

<b>

Neska and Niz were captivated by Sera's fight and were astonished by Noah's battle.

Of course, that's to be expected. Noah looks like a middle schooler, and she’s supposed to be my sister.

Even though Noah looks clearly young, she is definitely stronger than anyone in this country, including Neska. She may look like a brat, but she used to be a goddess, after all.

<b>

Then, we cheerfully tackled the uncharted fourth and fifth layers, leading to the boss battle.

<b>

Comparing Neska to the current ASR members, she may seem weak, but once her stats are properly adjusted, she could easily defeat Phenon or Shiri. Her combat sense is evident from being chosen as a representative of the Palmour Kingdom.

<b>

"So, shall we tackle the boss battle together? There’s only one boss, and no other monsters will come, so Niz can relax and watch."

<b>

"Uh... Well, from what I've seen in the previous battles, it seems like we won't suffer any damage."

<b>

"Right? So please keep an eye on things. Niz, since the king asked you to, you can't just sleep because you're bored, okay?"

<b>

"There's no way I can sleep in a dungeon!"

<b>

"Is that so? You'd be surprised how easily you can doze off."

<b>

When I previously challenged a B-rank dungeon looking for elixirs, I ended up sleeping quite a bit.

<b>

"What are you trying to do by recommending that I sleep...? Also, I fully understand that SR is relaxed, but shouldn't you have a bit more tension? If something happens, both I and Phenon will be sad—do you really want to see us sad, SR? Huh? What do you think?"

<b>

"I feel the same! I'm sure Shiri would be sad too."

<b>

Hmm. It's still not time to transfer to the boss room, so it's fine.

Once the battle starts, I'll be serious to some extent.

<b>

"From my perspective, it seems like all three of you are not tense at all—no, never mind, it's nothing."

<b>

Neska seemed to start saying something but then stopped.

For some reason, she looked like she was being comforted by Niz, who patted her on the back.
