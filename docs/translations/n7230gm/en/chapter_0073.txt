# 70 My "ORE" is O・R・E!

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day I finally acquired my long-desired new home.

Even for someone like me, who loves dungeons and battles, I couldn't bring myself to head to the dungeon today.

<b>

You're wondering if I haven't dropped a single ring yet?

Ha, who cares. I decided to relax at home today! No matter what anyone says, I made up my mind!!

<b>

After receiving a complete tour of the finished building from Roberto, we sent him off and started leisurely exploring the house again. Sera and the others were also checking out the terrace and admiring the flowerbeds in the garden filled with colorful flowers.

<b>

As for me,

<b>

"My long-awaited my bed... it's so fluffy."

<b>

I was lying on the bed in my room, which is about 10 tatami mats in size.

<b>

The bed in the doghouse of the royal capital was probably top-notch too, but that place felt more like an inn since Sera had said she stayed there before.

<b>

However, this house is different—it's my new home! No one has slept in this room yet! Though the house belongs to the party, this room is mine!

<b>

In the room, there were paintings and odd sculptures that I didn't remember ordering, creating a fantastic atmosphere. I don't know if Roberto picked them, but his taste is excellent.

<b>

As I propped myself up from the bed and gazed out the window, the door creaked open.

<b>

"There you are, SR. Have you seen the bathroom yet?"

<b>

Appearing with a cheerful expression was Sera.

While talking to me, she was looking around my room, nodding thoughtfully. She's probably confirming the differences from her room. I think they're almost the same, though.

<b>

"I was shown it first by Roberto."

<b>

"Hehe, you had a lot of enthusiasm for the bathroom, didn't you?"

<b>

"Well, yeah."

<b>

In this world, baths are generally made of metal or stone, and wooden ones are rare.

This house has an outdoor bath facing the garden, separate from the indoor one (of course, it has privacy screens). The outdoor bath is stone-tiled, while the indoor one is wood.

<b>

"Alright! Let's have a housewarming party today! We'll go shopping later with Reinas."

<b>

"That sounds good. I'll invite Phenon and the others too."

<b>

"Thanks!"

<b>

Sera nodded in agreement and briskly left the room. Her light steps indicated she also looked forward to the party. She's probably planning to drink some alcohol, huh? Well, it is a celebration, so she can drink as much as she likes.

<b>

"Even if Sera gets completely drunk, it's inside the house today, so I won't have to carry her back home like last time, which is an improvement."

<b>

I smiled wryly, recalling the time Sera was completely out of it.

<b>

I hope it doesn't turn into a hassle...

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Things have gotten very troublesome.

<b>

"Ah... so nice, SR..."

<b>

In front of me, in the bath was Sera, who wasn't even wrapped in a bath towel. Slurring her words, she was seeking my agreement.

<b>

Right, it feels nice and heavenly...—there’s no way I’d say that!

<b>

"Why are you getting in here!? Get out, you fool! This is ridiculous!"

<b>

"There are no monsters left~. It's up to the Sword Saint~."

<b>

"Our conversation is completely out of sync..."

<b>

She was miming sword moves while saying "shushu," and let me tell you, things were jiggling a lot.

For some reason, I, being a guy, found myself shrinking and desperately trying to hide my body.

Could you not go wild in the bath? The splashes are hitting my face.

<b>

<b>

Today, as I planned, the housewarming party was held.

Sera drank heavily, flowing alcohol into her stomach just like during the B-rank dungeon celebration. I told her to drink in moderation, but considering it was "inside the house," I didn’t press the issue too hard.

<b>

Phenon enjoyed the party with some juice just like I did, while Shilly kept Sera company with drinks. However, she only turned red in the face, showing little change from her usual self—she was just a bit more talkative.

<b>

Ignoring Sera, who was face down on the table with her nose puffed up, the three of us took care of the party cleanup. Sera had worked hard to prepare, and no one complained.

After that, while Phenon and Shilly went to take a bath, I carried Sera to her room and laid her down on the bed. I only half-threw her, by the way.

<b>

Phenon and Shilly, looking very sleepy after their baths, talked with me in the living room for a bit before heading back to their rooms.

Phenon tried to take me to her room, but of course, I declined. There’s an order to things, Princess.

<b>

Goodnight—after saying goodbye to the two of them, I planned to enjoy the bath alone, but then intoxicated Sera invaded. And that brings us to the current situation.

<b>

<b>

"I’d better not sober up quickly—ideally, she should stay drunk like this."

<b>

It would probably be better if we both forgot the fact that we entered the bath together without clothes. For both our sakes.

<b>

As I tried to avoid looking at her skin, I moved through the bath towards the direction of the changing room. However, anything that came into my view was unavoidable, so I saved it in my mental "treasures" folder. What an unfortunate accident.

<b>

On another note, I currently possess no towel.

<b>

Meaning I have nothing to hide my body. Right now, my defense is incredibly low, to the point that I would want even a single leaf. No matter how confident I am in my evasion skills, I’ve never trained to dodge eyes.

<b>

To ensure that nothing is seen, I need to jump out of the bath and race toward the door leading to the changing room in an instant. Speed is key. I’ll switch to the class with the highest AGI from the menu.

<b>

Taking a deep breath, I slowly exhale.

<b>

I steeled myself and, placing my hands on the edge, lifted my body from the bath all at once—only to be stopped by Sera, who had clung to me in my natural state.

<b>

"That’s my ring~."

<b>

That movement was blocked by Sera, who embraced me in her natural form.

<b>

Are you saying she can keep up with my AGI――!?

<b>

The elasticity of my rear collided with the marshmallow softness of Sera. Her hands slid down just below my belly button, and if I forcibly lifted my body, I’d be in a situation where my "ORE" would be exposed! Thus, I couldn't move.

<b>

The tension equaled that of facing off against the Demon King. Every motion could alter my fate. Sweat dripped from my chin onto the back of my hands. This life-or-death situation—what a thrill (confusion).

<b>

"Someone... help me..."

<b>

Suppressing my urge to cry, I murmured. However, there was no sign of help coming.

Only the sound of droplets hitting the ceiling was the entirety of this space's noise.

<b>

<b>

After a few minutes of battle between my backside and the marshmallow, the beautiful maid Shilly, who had probably been searching for us, appeared in her pajamas from the changing room.

In other words, right in front of me. Half my body was out of the bath, facing her.

<b>

Hello there!

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day after.

<b>

For a while, every time I made eye contact with Shilly, her face would flush red.
