# 70 I'm O.RE!

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day I finally got my long-desired new home.

Even I, who loves dungeons and battles, couldn't bring myself to head to a dungeon today.

<b>

You think I haven't dropped a single ring yet?

Ha, who cares? I've decided to relax in this house today! No matter what anyone says, I've made up my mind!!

<b>

After receiving a complete explanation of the finished building from Roberto, we saw him off and began to leisurely explore the house again. Sera and the others were also stepping out onto the terrace and walking through the garden, admiring the flowerbeds filled with colorful flowers.

<b>

And as for me,

<b>

"My long-awaited my bed... it's so fluffy."

<b>

I was lying on the bed in my room, which is about 10 tatami mats in size.

<b>

The bed in the doghouse in the royal capital was probably a high-quality item too, but that place felt more like an inn since Sera said she had stayed there before.

<b>

However, this house is different—it's a new home! No one has slept in this room yet! The house belongs to the party, but this room is mine!

<b>

The room is decorated with paintings and various objects that I don't remember requesting, creating a fantastic atmosphere. I don't know if Roberto chose them, but he has great taste.

<b>

As I sat up from the bed and gazed out at the view from the window, the door swung open with a click.

<b>

"There you are, Esuar Have you seen the bathroom yet?"

<b>

Sera appeared with a cheerful expression.

While talking to me, she was looking around my room, observing it with a thoughtful "hmm." She was probably checking the differences from her own room. I think they are almost the same, though.

<b>

"I went to see it first with Roberto."

<b>

"Hehe, you had quite the enthusiasm for the bathroom, didn't you?"

<b>

"Well, yeah."

<b>

In this world, baths are generally made of metal or stone, and wooden ones are almost nonexistent.

This house has an outdoor bath facing the garden, separate from the indoor bath (of course, there is a privacy screen). The outdoor bath is stone-paved, while the indoor one is wooden.

<b>

"Alright! Let's have a housewarming party today! We'll go shopping with Renas later."

<b>

"That sounds good. I'll go invite Phenon and the others."

<b>

"Thanks!"

<b>

Sera nodded at my words and briskly left the room. From her light footsteps, it was clear she was looking forward to the party. Is she planning to drink? Well, since it's a celebration, she can drink as much as she wants.

<b>

"Even if Sera gets completely drunk, it's inside the house today, so I won't have to carry her back home like last time, so that's an improvement."

<b>

I chuckled as I recalled the time Sera had been completely out of it.

<b>

I hope it doesn't turn into a troublesome situation...

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

It turned into a very troublesome situation.

<b>

"Ah... it feels so good, Esuar"

<b>

In front of me, soaking in the bathtub, was Sera, who wasn't even wrapped in a bath towel. She was slurring her words and seeking my agreement.

<b>

Yeah, it feels good, it's paradise—there's no way I'm saying that!

<b>

"Why are you getting in here!? Get out, you idiot! This is crazy!"

<b>

"The monsters are gone now. I'll leave it to the Sword Saint."

<b>

"Our conversation isn't matching at all..."

<b>

She was making sword-swinging motions while saying "shushushushu." I won't say what was shaking, but it was quite a lot.

For some reason, I, a man, was shrinking back and desperately trying to hide my body.

And seriously, stop flailing around in the bath. The splashes are hitting my face.

<b>

<b>

Today, as planned, the housewarming party took place.

Sera was chugging down alcohol like during the celebration for conquering the B-rank dungeon. I told her to take it easy, but since I thought, "It's inside the house, so it should be fine," I didn't insist too much.

Phenon enjoyed the party with juice, just like me, while Shiri accompanied Sera in drinking. However, she only turned red in the face and didn't change much otherwise. She just became a bit more talkative.

Leaving Sera, who was face down on the table with her cheeks puffed out, we three cleaned up after the party. Sera had worked hard to prepare, so no one complained.

Afterward, while Phenon and Shiri were in the bath, I carried Sera to her room and laid her down on the bed. I only half-heartedly tossed her, but that's a secret.

After getting out of the bath, Phenon and Shiri looked very sleepy. They chatted with me for a bit in the living room before heading back to their own rooms.

Phenon almost took me to her room, but of course, I declined. There is a proper order to things, Princess.

<b>

Goodnight—I greeted the two of them and then planned to enjoy the bath alone, but then drunk Sera barged in. And that's how we ended up in the current situation.

<b>

<b>

"For now, I should try to stay sober—no, it's better if I don't. Please stay drunk like this."

<b>

The fact that I was in the bath with her completely naked is something best forgotten. For both of us.

<b>

Trying not to look at her skin, I moved smoothly through the bath toward the direction of the changing room. However, there were things that entered my line of sight that I couldn't help, so I saved them in my mental "treasure" folder. This is an unfortunate accident.

<b>

Speaking of which, I currently do not have a towel.

<b>

In other words, I have nothing to hide myself with. My defense is so low that I would want even a single leaf. No matter how confident I am in my evasion skills, I've never trained to escape from gazes.

<b>

To avoid being seen, I need to get out of the bath in an instant and dash to the door leading to the changing room. Speed is of the essence. I switch to the profession with the highest AGI from the menu screen.

<b>

Taking a deep breath, I slowly exhaled.

<b>

I steeled myself, placed my hands on the edge, and suddenly lifted my body out of the bath—only to be stopped by Sera, who had hugged me in her natural state.

<b>

She can keep up with my AGI—what!?

<b>

The elasticity of my rear collided with the marshmallow-like elasticity of Sera. Her hand was wrapped just below my navel, and if I forcibly pulled my body up, I would end up in a state of O.RE! Therefore, I couldn't move.

<b>

The tension was comparable to facing the Demon King Venom. Every move could determine my fate. Sweat dripped from my chin onto the back of my hand. This life-and-death situation—what a thrill (confusion).

<b>

"Someone... help me..."

<b>

Suppressing the urge to cry, I murmured. However, there was no sign of help coming.

The only sound in this space was the plop of water droplets falling from the ceiling.

<b>

<b>

After a few minutes of the butt vs. marshmallow showdown, the beautiful maid Shiri, who had probably been looking for us, appeared in her pajamas from the changing room.

In other words, right in front of me. Half of my body was out of the bathtub, right in front of me.

<b>

Hello!

<b>

<b>

<b>

The following day and beyond.

<b>

For a while, Shiri would blush every time she made eye contact with me.
