# A-47 Audience and the Relatives' Uncle

<b>

<b>

<b>

Thank you, thank you for having me.

I came here as ASR for some sightseeing and to pass the time in the dungeon.

<b>

I did have a slight desire to greet the king in a light-hearted manner, but I ended up making a safe choice, which is quite typical of the Japanese temperament, adapting to the surroundings.

<b>

"Raise your face."

<b>

As I lifted only my face while still kneeling, the king of the Palmour Kingdom—Veed Le Palmour—maintained a solemn expression and directed his gaze toward us—or rather, straight at me.

<b>

The day after we relaxed our travel fatigue at a luxury inn, we headed to the royal castle to tackle our tasks. It felt like summer vacation homework. Once it's done, we can play as much as we want! No complaints allowed!

<b>

Currently, besides us ASR members, there were the king, the queen, a young man who resembled the king (probably the prince), several royal guards, a person who seemed like a prime minister, and a few noble-looking individuals. Since we weren't formally introduced, most of this is just my guess.

<b>

Since we were only here to greet, I hoped nothing troublesome would arise—while waiting for His Majesty Veed to speak again, it seemed he had finally finished his observation of me.

<b>

"This time, you have traveled a long way, and I appreciate your efforts. Your achievements have reached even our country across the borders."

<b>

The king and queen are probably around forty years old. They have a very active presence.

His Majesty's hair is a somewhat deep orange color, and he has a distinctly chiseled face.

<b>

"I would like all of you from ASR to challenge the unexplored dungeons of our country and gather as much information as possible."

<b>

"—Yes."

<b>

I replied in a manner that seemed appropriate.

That much shouldn't be too different from game knowledge, and I could check the differences while having fun in the dungeons. To be honest, I don't remember much about the lower-ranked dungeons, but the A and S rank ones are deeply etched in my memory.

<b>

His Majesty, who nodded graciously at my response, continued speaking.

<b>

"Well, you don't need to feel too pressured. It's just a suggestion. If you have other matters to attend to, you can prioritize those."

<b>

"Yes."

<b>

His casual way of speaking was reminiscent of a relative uncle, and I couldn't help but respond in a relaxed manner.

I was expecting more political maneuvering or something that the nobles and royalty of the Palmour Kingdom would engage in, but it didn't seem to have that atmosphere.

<b>

After that, His Majesty exchanged a few words with the other members besides me, and the audience came to an end.

<b>

—Or so it seemed, but the real event was just beginning.

<b>

"You know, I'm not good with stiff formalities. It makes my shoulders tense. That way of speaking doesn't suit me either."

<b>

Ha ha ha! His Majesty Veed laughed heartily. Yes, he is indeed His Majesty. No matter what anyone says, he is still His Majesty.

This person's transformation into a relative uncle is progressing rapidly... at least in my mind. It somewhat reminds me of Duke Margus, who pulled off that prosthetic hand scam.

<b>

After the audience ended and we were led to another room, we found ourselves face to face with almost the same group again. The participants were the king, the queen, and the young man.

<b>

"Father is as usual... Oh, I apologize for the delay. I am the first prince, Niz Le Palmour. I'm sorry to keep you when you're tired."

<b>

It seems my guess was correct; the young man was indeed a prince.

Though I wonder about his demeanor as royalty, he carries himself with a humble attitude, which is quite likable for a former Japanese person. Moreover, he is a handsome guy, which is quite unfortunate.

<b>

"I am Ceres. Nice to meet you, Your Majesty?"

<b>

The one who said that with a smile is the queen, His Majesty's wife.

Seriously, these people are really close! I'm very welcoming of it, but is that okay? They are royalty after all!

Of course, I couldn't shout such thoughts out loud, so I responded in a calm voice.

<b>

"Well, unlike Fenon or Sera... I'm just an ordinary commoner, not a noble or anything. Please stop with the 'Your Majesty,' Ceres. It makes me uneasy."

<b>

"Oh dear, you're as stiff as Nii-chan. Since this isn't an official occasion, you can relax a bit more~"

<b>

"Mother... please refrain from that name in public... There are positions to consider."

<b>

Saying that, Prince Niz had a face like he had bitten into a bitter bug, his shoulders slumping.

My image of "royalty" is collapsing. It's crumbling with a loud noise, like a building being demolished. I couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for Niz.

<b>

"By the way, SR. I received reports from those who saw the match saying you were at a 'non-human level'... How about it? Do you think you can conquer our country's dungeons?"

<b>

His Majesty said after gulping down the wine prepared by the maid.

Non-human!? Was I being referred to like that?! Who gave such baseless reports?!

I lightly swung my hand down towards Sera, who muttered, "Non-human—certainly," and sighed.

<b>

"I was originally planning to go for the S rank, and I was thinking of checking out the nearby A rank dungeons. I can't relax if I keep moving from town to town. —Ah, of course, I can conquer them. The difficulty shouldn't be much different from the Lindale Kingdom."

<b>

Since this is my first time stepping into this country, I spoke as if I knew nothing. If I were to say that the boss of the S rank dungeon in this country is a nine-tailed fox, it would be obvious I would be looked at suspiciously.

<b>

"Well... you seem quite confident. So, for example, if one of your members were to be absent, would it be difficult to conquer the S rank?"

<b>

With that, His Majesty smirked.

<b>

"……Well, I could manage."

<b>

Honestly, since they showed that match, there was no need to hide my abilities anymore.

That said, clearly stating "I can manage alone" in front of the ASR members felt like I was saying I didn't need them, which made me hesitant.

<b>

Hearing my response, His Majesty chuckled merrily and said, "I see, I see," before continuing,

<b>

"Then, may I make a request from the Palmour Kingdom to ASR?" 

<b>

He suddenly brought that up.
