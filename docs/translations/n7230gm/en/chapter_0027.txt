# 26 Beautiful Smile

<b>

<b>

<b>

We were brought to the royal castle and first guided to a relatively spacious reception room. After waiting for about ten minutes, since my injury hadn't completely healed, both Sera and I were taken to separate private rooms.

<b>

I wasn't expecting "maybe we're in the same room" or anything like that.

<b>

It's true!

<b>

The Thunderbolt's Trace probably either handed the elixir to someone or went directly to the princess. I hope her illness has recovered safely. Well, if it's an elixir, it should be fine. After all, it's a complete healing potion that cures any injury or status ailment.

<b>

"It feels somehow nostalgic."

<b>

The place I'm in now is the room I was shown on the day I first arrived in this world. The bed, the walls, the ceiling, the furnishings—everything looks familiar. Despite being nervous, I surprisingly remember it well.

<b>

Currently, I'm sitting on the bed, and the room is filled with a soft orange light. The light source is a bracket attached to the wall. I have no idea how it emits light in this world without electricity. Is it the power of a magic stone?

<b>

On the nearby side table, there are three bottles filled with a dark blue potion.

This color must be for a high-level potion. Quite generous of them.

Since it's here, that means I can drink it freely, right?

<b>

"---Yeah. It's tastier than a mid-level potion."

<b>

I downed one bottle for now.

The amount is about 200 ml, so I gulped it down in one go.

<b>

After placing the empty bottle on the side table, I collapsed onto the bed.

<b>

"I couldn't sleep the last time I was here..."

<b>

I mutter while gazing at the ceiling, dyed in the color of the sunset, illuminated by the light.

Back then, I was in such a state that I didn't know left from right, and I was trembling, fearing I might be sentenced to death, so it's understandable.

<b>

But now, it's different.

I've gotten used to this world, and I'm a member of the party that saved the princess. I shouldn't have to worry about being treated poorly.

Moreover, having achieved the goal of conquering a B-rank dungeon has also relaxed me.

<b>

And above all, I'm at my limit of fatigue.

I've been working hard for about twenty days. Looking back now, it was indeed fun. I love leveling up, and battles with stronger opponents are exhilarating.

<b>

Well, more than that,

<b>

"......I should sleep."

<b>

I'm so tired that I have no tension left.

I fell asleep in a room of the royal castle, half losing consciousness.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I next woke up, it was past 5 PM.

I have no idea what time I fell asleep, so I don't know how long I slept. However, thanks to the luxurious bed, most of my fatigue has recovered. My left arm and side still don't feel quite right, but they should be completely healed by tomorrow.

As expected of a fantasy world. A broken bone takes only two days to heal.

<b>

Aside from the pain in my abdomen, my stomach voiced its hunger, so I rang the bell to call someone. I usually only keep enough food for the day in my inventory, so I have nothing to eat.

<b>

After a while, I heard a knock. When I replied, "Come in," the door opened quietly.

<b>

"Did you call for me? Lord SR."

<b>

The person who appeared was the nostalgic beautiful maid—Siri.

I felt happy that the same person from before came to see me. She's beautiful, after all.

<b>

"Long time no see, Siri. I would like something easy to digest, please."

<b>

I feel a bit presumptuous, but it's not like I chose to be here. If I could leave the royal castle, I'd go to a restaurant in town, but that's not possible.

Upon hearing my request, Siri's eyes and mouth opened wide in a big smile, and she clasped her hands in front of her chest.

<b>

"You remember my name! I'm honored!"

<b>

Of course I do. She's a beautiful lady.

<b>

"If it's gentle on the stomach... how about some fruit or porridge?"

<b>

So they have porridge.

<b>

In the game, there were normal dishes like katsudon and tempura set meals, so it's not surprising... but I was hoping for something more unique to this world, like caterpillar dishes or orc steak... though I would be troubled if those were served.

<b>

"Then I'll have porridge, please."

<b>

When I said that, Siri replied, "Understood," and bowed respectfully. She was about to leave right away, so I hurriedly called her back. I wanted to ask about the princess and what would happen next.

<b>

"Has the princess recovered from her illness?"

<b>

"Yes. Thanks to you, Lord Thunderbolt's Trace, and Lady Sera, she is doing well now. Thank you very much."

<b>

After saying that, Siri bowed deeply.

<b>

"Currently, she is resting to be cautious, but as expected of the legendary elixir. She has returned to her former energetic self."

<b>

I don't know how she was before, but I'm glad to hear she's doing well.

<b>

"That's great to hear. So, what should I do from here? I haven't received any explanations."

<b>

"Yes. Since both Lady Sera and Lord SR had injuries, and everyone seemed quite exhausted, the audience with His Majesty has been postponed until tomorrow. I don't know the details about it either..."

<b>

Siri said that, blushing slightly while furrowing her brow.

<b>

I was worried they might ask for details about the dungeon conquest, but I never expected to have to speak with His Majesty. I'm not good with formal atmospheres, but I suppose I'll just have to endure this.

I should think of something to request in case they ask.

<b>

Also, there was something I absolutely had to tell her.

<b>

As Siri opened the door to leave, I called out, "Excuse me!" My feelings were so strong that my voice naturally became louder.

She tilted her head cutely and asked, "What is it?"

<b>

A well-defined face.

Even over her maid outfit, her figure was like that of a gravure model, stirring the instincts of a man.

And each of her adorable gestures made me hesitate to speak.

<b>

But I had reached my limit.

<b>

"---Please let me use the restroom!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

That night, just before 10 PM. As I lay on the bed, checking the accumulated drops in my inventory, there was a knock on the door.

<b>

Who could it be at this hour?

I hurriedly sat up and replied, "Come in." Then, a familiar woman entered the room.

<b>

"I'm sorry for coming at night. How are you feeling?"

<b>

The voice belonged to Sera.

Perhaps because we were indoors, she was dressed more casually than usual. She wore a pure white lace dress. The atmosphere was so different from usual that I felt strangely nervous.

<b>

"Yes. I've been able to rest well, so I'm feeling much better. How about you, Sera? Are you okay now?"

<b>

"I'm fine. Most of my injuries were superficial."

<b>

After saying that, she exaggeratedly let out a big sigh.

<b>

"More than me, it's you, SR. You promised not to overdo it, yet you seem to have pushed yourself quite a bit."

<b>

She was probably referring to the time I took the Cyclops' attack head-on. It was good that we defeated it, but I ended up with serious injuries.

<b>

"Ugh... I have no excuse..."

<b>

Being scolded by a woman who is over ten years younger than me in mental age is quite something.

Some might take it as a reward, but I don't have such a peculiar kink, so I simply felt pathetic.

<b>

Seeing me shrink in on myself, she chuckled.

<b>

"I can't believe the hero who defeated the boss alone is like this."

<b>

"I'm not a hero. Anyone could do what I did, even you, Sera."

<b>

"I hope that's the case."

<b>

Sera said with a wry smile, then came right in front of me and knelt down. Then, she suddenly took my right hand with both of hers and placed it on her forehead.

<b>

Huh? What are you doing? What on earth is happening?

<b>

Ignoring my confusion, she began to speak while maintaining that posture.

<b>

"I just spoke with Fenon—the princess. She seemed very lively."

<b>

As she said that, she sniffled. The grip on my hand tightened a little.

<b>

"Thank you so much for saving her. She is an irreplaceable friend to me. Because of you, she can continue to live. I can keep smiling too."

<b>

With a voice mixed with sobs, she said.

Being thanked so seriously makes me feel embarrassed. I would be fine with a casual "Thanks" or "No problem."

I felt my body squirming in the unfamiliar atmosphere, and I ended up teasingly saying,

<b>

"Are you really smiling, Sera? I can hear you sniffing."

<b>

"......Idiot."

<b>

She said that in a voice barely audible, then looked up. Her eyes were red and swollen, and there were traces of tears on her cheeks.

But she was smiling.

<b>

It was a smile I had never seen before, a radiant grin.

<b>

"Thank you, SR."

<b>

Feeling shy, I scratched my cheek with my finger.

<b>

Enduring sleep deprivation to level up and enduring pain was worth it—her expression made it seem like that, a beautiful smile.
