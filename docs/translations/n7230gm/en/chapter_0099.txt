# 96 From Now On

<b>

<b>

"I'm sorry to interrupt your enthusiasm, but let's set up the environment first. You understand that it will take time before you can challenge Venom, right?"

<b>

"Right now, go and beat up some monsters!" Noah said in a relaxed tone, as if to admonish me for leaning forward in excitement.

<b>

Indeed, there is nothing in this world right now. Just the ground and the sky.

<b>

While sleep can be managed with the pillow in my inventory, there's no food, which is essential for survival. It wouldn't be funny to starve to death before challenging Venom.

<b>

"You don't need to replenish energy through meals. Also, let's make it so that you don't need to excrete. You can also eliminate the need for sleep, but if you don't rest moderately, your mind will break before your body does."

<b>

She read my thoughts.

It's not like I was thinking anything shameful, so it's fine.

<b>

"…That's appreciated, but we don't have much time, do we? If you can operate without sleep, wouldn't that be better?"

<b>

"If you defeat more than five S-rank dungeon bosses in a day, the situation won't worsen. It should be easy for you, right?"

<b>

"Ah… I can prepare monsters as I like, huh?"

<b>

"That's right. Let's prepare as many of your favorite monsters as you want."

<b>

"Oh…"

<b>

If that's the case, it seems I can level up at a much faster pace than initially planned. I thought it would take four years, but it could be shortened significantly.

There's no need to search for monsters, and I can only face bosses that give good experience. Moreover, considering what she said, it might even be possible to fight multiple bosses at the same time, which wasn't possible in the game.

<b>

"For now, I'll build a house. It won't take much power to protect it from Venom's destruction."

<b>

As she said that, Noah stretched her left hand toward the ground diagonally below.

<b>

Then――,

<b>

"Oh… that was really quick."

<b>

The time taken was merely three seconds. It was a sight that would make any carpenter faint.

Something like the light of fireflies began to float around, gathering at a point, and then expanding instantaneously.

In front of me appeared a wooden structure that resembled a storage shed rather than a house, with a space of about eight tatami mats.

<b>

Curious, I went inside, and there was just one bed. It was an extremely simple living environment.

Since it seems I don't need to eat, I don't need a table or anything. Noah seems capable of creating anything, so I can just ask her for what I need if necessary.

<b>

"Would you have preferred a bigger house?"

<b>

Noah called out to me from the entrance as I sat down on the bed.

<b>

"No, it's fine. I want to defeat Venom as soon as possible, so I don't need any entertainment."

<b>

Even if I take it easy, it would only delay my reunion with Sera and the others.

<b>

"…I see. Then for now, I'll give you this."

<b>

Saying that, she extended her right hand toward me.

Then, something black and fabric-like fell onto my lap with a rustling sound. Is it a change of clothes or something?

<b>

"…What is this?"

<b>

"It's the clothes you wore while playing Tempest. I didn't have enough power to create weapons, so I made this first."

<b>

"That's… quite the cheat."

<b>

When I unfolded it, just as she said, these were the items I had worn in the game before.

The black outfit I used to love. It has a rather ominous name, 'Black Coffin.' I'm not a dead person, though―― I want to say.

This outfit has low magical and physical resistance but provides a boost to AGI and DEX, making it a rare piece of equipment.

It looks a bit like an assassin's outfit, which stimulates my chuunibyou heart, so I liked wearing it.

<b>

The equipment I wore in Tempest was all S-rank dungeon boss drops, and they had a very low appearance rate.

So, for them to appear like magic, what else could this be called if not cheating?

<b>

"You provided information about the derivative secondary classes in this world, right? Thanks to that, more people have been diving into dungeon exploration, and power has been accumulated. The fact that this world has maintained its form up to this point is also a result of your efforts."

<b>

It seems that the overall level-up of the world, which I thought had gone to waste, has unexpectedly been useful.

<b>

Speaking of which,

<b>

"If that's how power can be accumulated, then why didn't you provide information about professions in this world earlier? Can't you do something like a divine revelation?"

<b>

"I can do divine revelations. But, as you spread the information without me having to say anything, it worked out."

<b>

"I'm talking about before I came here."

<b>

If the information about professions had been properly conveyed in this world, Fenon wouldn't have suffered from illness, and Noah herself could have accumulated power, right?

<b>

I thought that and asked, but she shook her head and answered shortly, "That's impossible."

<b>

"Why not? Even if it's not about professions, if the status display hadn't been simplified like this, someone might have noticed the player bonuses."

<b>

Hearing my grumbling words, Noah shrugged her shoulders.

<b>

"The status was intentionally not protected and was erased."

<b>

As she said that, she entered the room and sat down next to me.

<b>

"Do you remember when I mentioned before that I can't create a 'world without consistency'?"

<b>

"…Yeah, I remember. That's why everyone forgets about me, right?"

<b>

When this world is recreated, since I'm a resident of Earth, I would end up entering later, so I can't create a history where I existed―― that was the gist of it.

<b>

"Exactly. So, what do you think would have happened if the player bonuses had been displayed correctly in this world?"

<b>

"…Well, dungeon exploration would have progressed much further. Naturally, people would have noticed the derivative secondary and tertiary classes, and even S-rank dungeons would――"

<b>

I was about to say something when I realized. So that's how it is.

<b>

"I see… In other words, if the inhabitants of this world, which is your creation, had the power to conquer S-rank dungeons, this world would have collapsed early on."

<b>

Hearing my words, Noah nodded in satisfaction. It seems I was correct.

<b>

"The dungeons in this world are sealed by Venom. That's why, while incorporating the game's mechanics, I had Venom destroy the status and hide it. If power could have been accumulated sufficiently, maybe two or three people could have been protected, but they would be too weak as a fighting force against Venom."

<b>

"Hey, I'm alone here."

<b>

"You are special. You possess the rare soul that can kill a god while being human. That's why I took a long time, even at the cost of damaging my body, to summon you to this world."

<b>

With a slight smile, Noah said that.

It seems she holds me in quite high regard. Well, I might just have to believe that.

<b>

Noah probably has no other options left and is left with no choice but to cling to me. She mentioned "damaging my body" to summon me, and if I were to lose to Venom, there might not be another chance.

<b>

<b>

Whether there will be another chance or not, I have no intention of losing at all.
