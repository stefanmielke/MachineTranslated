# A-2 Sibling Quarrel

<b>

Having defeated Venom and with the world reset, I have officially become an unnamed explorer.

<b>

That said, not everyone has lost their memories from the past.

<b>

Thanks to the consideration of the creator god of Earth, Lady Idea, Serah, Phenon, Shiri, and the three from the Thunder Trail, along with Regulus, the guild master of the royal capital, retain their memories from before the collapse. Naturally, the little brat who was the former administrator of this world does as well.

<b>

"Hey, big brother. I want to eat the skewers from that stall over there."

<b>

The former administrator walking beside me tugs at the hem of my clothes and says in a childish voice.

<b>

Her gaze is fixed on a well-worn stall commonly seen on the main street of the royal capital, and she noticeably swallows hard. The latter part is not an act, is it?

<b>

"Sure, go ahead. I’ll be back in about five hours, so take your time eating."

<b>

"Okay, got it—wait! Isn’t that terrible!? I can’t spend that much time on skewers! And alone!?"

<b>

"You can earn money in the dungeon, right? Eat as much as you want."

<b>

"That’s not the point! It’s too boring! I can’t keep a conversation going with the uncle!"

<b>

"Geez, little sisters are so selfish."

<b>

"Clearly, it’s your fault, big brother!?"

<b>

Satisfied with watching Noah pout in anger, I said, "I was just joking," and started walking towards the stall. I bought two skewers for myself and headed towards the explorer guild, holding one in each hand.

<b>

"Seriously... big brother is getting more and more careless with me every day."

<b>

"Is that so?"

<b>

At Noah's muttering, I tilted my head in confusion.

I tried to recall recent events, but I couldn’t think of anything specific.

However, it seems that her mind still holds onto the memory of grievances, as she raises her voice, "That’s right!"

<b>

"You stole my fried chicken the other day!"

<b>

When I wondered what she was talking about, it turned out to be that.

Besides, I didn’t really steal it.

<b>

"I just swapped it for the fried chicken on my plate."

<b>

"The sizes were completely different! Yours was this tiny, and mine was this huge!"

<b>

Noah exaggeratedly gestures to show the size difference of the fried chicken. She indicated sizes roughly equivalent to a soybean and a soccer ball. No way that’s true.

<b>

"There's no way you could eat something that big... and by the way, Noah, are your personality and behavior being influenced by your body size?"

<b>

Or perhaps it’s because she no longer has the responsibilities of an administrator and is freed from pressure? In other words, she might be showing her true self now.

In any case, if she had been this energetic when the world was on the brink of destruction, I might have accidentally swung my hand down.

<b>

"Violence is bad!"

<b>

"So stop reading my mind..."

<b>

"This is fine, right? You stole my fried chicken without permission. If you say I shouldn’t read your mind... then maybe I’ll spill the beans about Serah’s bread in my inventory—"

<b>

Just before Noah finished her sentence, I slipped behind her and covered her mouth with my hand. The muffled protests and warm humidity hit my palm, but that wasn’t my concern.

<b>

Did anyone hear that? It’s okay, right?

<b>

"That was close... Noah, saying that is unfair."

<b>

As I wiped the unpleasant sweat from my forehead, Noah took the opportunity to slip out of my grasp.

<b>

"—Phew, what are you doing!"

<b>

"That’s my line! Don’t suddenly say weird things!"

<b>

"It’s your fault for bullying me, big brother!"

<b>

"You little brat...! Don’t say 'mon' when you’re older!"

<b>

"—Huh!? That’s a forbidden phrase, big brother. Ah... I’m so mad now, I’ll tell Shiri that 'I was bullied by big brother.'"

<b>

Crossing her arms, Noah turns her face away from me with a huff.

What kind of situation is it for a goddess to complain to a maid?

<b>

As we continued to bicker over trivial matters, we heard a loud sigh that drowned out our voices.

<b>

Noah and I turned our faces toward the direction of the voice simultaneously.

<b>

"Hey, you two, stop the sibling quarrel in front of the guild entrance... We’ve received complaints from other explorers."

<b>

There stood Regulus, the guild master, wearing a tired expression. He scratched his bald head while giving us a sidelong glance.

<b>

Though we were engrossed in our conversation, it seems our feet had unconsciously led us to the explorer guild.

<b>

We both hurriedly bowed our heads to Regulus and the surrounding explorers.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

The reason we visited the guild today was for the activity report of the party "ASR," which includes Princess Phenon and Serah, who has been given the title of "Sword Princess."

<b>

—That’s the official reason, but the truth is I was consulting Regulus about the regulations for A-rank and S-rank dungeons.

<b>

By the way, this embarrassingly named party comes from my nickname during my gaming days, derived from Avoidance's SR.

<b>

Of course, Phenon and the others have no way of knowing that, but thanks to the meddling of that little brat, it was decided unanimously before I was reincarnated. How did it come to this?

<b>

"However, even though your name is in the party name, you’re stuck with babysitting and chores. Aren’t you dissatisfied with being seen that way? Moreover, you are the genuine savior of this world, you know?"

<b>

In our familiar private room, Noah and I sat side by side, while Regulus sat heavily on the opposite sofa.

<b>

"Since I’ve finally become unnamed, I don’t want to stand out like before. The chores are for the sake of appearances. Besides, they plan to pass it off as 'just a coincidence' regarding the name being included."

<b>

"Haha... that’s unfortunate for them."

<b>

"Wait a minute! The babysitting is also for the sake of appearances, right!? You’re not really thinking of doing babysitting, are you!?"

<b>

Noah protested while flailing her legs, and Regulus responded with a wry smile.

<b>

"Y-yes, Lady Noah. I believe the SR just misspoke..."

<b>

"Noah, big brother is talking about work, so you should go play outside and wait."

<b>

"Ugh!! I’m not a kid!!"

<b>

"Clearly, you are a kid. Regulus, you think so too, right?"

<b>

"…Please, I beg you, don’t put me on the spot…"

<b>

Saying that, Regulus covered his face with his large hands and looked down. I had inadvertently asked him a question that stressed him out. I regret it.

<b>

Well, it’s good that there won’t be any more hair falling out.
