# A-129 The Exhausted Members

<b>

<b>

<b>

After defeating the ultra-black dragon turtle named by Hisui (laughs), we explored the cave—resulting in us being able to collect the target coins, but it had gotten late.

<b>

To be honest, I wanted to try buying a residence within the dungeon, but since it would be bad to worry Sera and the others by staying too late, we reluctantly decided to make an emergency return from the dungeon.

<b>

When we stepped outside, the sun had already set, and the sky was dark.

<b>

However, it seems that development is progressing around the dungeon, with buildings under construction (probably a reception area, which seems unnecessary) and the installation of lighting magical tools.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work—have Sera and the others come out yet?"

<b>

I asked a guard who was patrolling the area around the dungeon. It seems that they had already finished their exploration and returned to the royal capital. The current time was just past eleven at night, and they had returned home about an hour ago.

<b>

According to the guard, the three of them, except for Noah, looked extremely tired and had left a message saying, "Please let the SRs know that we're heading back first."

<b>

Regardless of Noah, given Sera and the others' personalities, they probably would have stayed behind to wait for us, so they must have been very exhausted.

<b>

"Well, it was an S-rank opponent, so they must have been mentally drained too."

<b>

"Or maybe Noah was tougher than expected."

<b>

As I listened to Crescent and Hisui's predictions, I tried to think for myself—but stopped.

After all, I would find out once we returned to the party house, and it would be best to see how they were doing.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Instead of using a luxurious and leisurely carriage, we ran home as a trio.

<b>

Crescent and Hisui's house is located near Reinas, so when they are in the royal capital, they usually stay at an inn. Since my parents and some servants are currently in our party house, it might not be very relaxing for the two of them, who aren't used to living with a large number of people.

<b>

So, I promised Crescent and Hisui that we would dive again from tomorrow morning and returned to the party house alone…

<b>

"You all seem really tired..."

<b>

"Ugh... Esuaru~"

<b>

When I called out, Sera groaned my name in a voice that sounded like a moan.

<b>

Each of the three of them was sprawled out on the sofa. Even Shiri, who is supposed to fulfill her role as a maid while being active as an ASR member, was face down on the sofa today. It seems they really had a tough time.

<b>

"So, what happened?"

<b>

When I asked, Sera, Phenon, and Shiri answered in order.

<b>

"I was trained by Noah."

<b>

"We hardly had any breaks..."

<b>

"It seems we're trying to rest as much as possible since we’ll be doing the same thing tomorrow... I don't even have the energy to eat."

<b>

Hahaha... And it seems that Noah and my parents had already gone to sleep. They had waited for my return, even while feeling exhausted.

<b>

"Moreover, in the end, everyone was killed by monsters—so that's also why we’ve lost our appetite."

<b>

Shiri spoke while keeping her cheek pressed against the sofa, moving only her mouth. It was the first time I had seen Shiri so completely worn out, so it felt fresh.

<b>

"Well, in that regard... I guess you just have to get used to it. And I'm relieved that everyone besides Noah was able to revive properly. Also, I don't know what Noah was thinking when she said that, but the death penalty means you can't re-enter for 24 hours, so at least until tomorrow night, you won't have to deal with that training."

<b>

When I said that, the three of them suddenly sat up almost simultaneously. Just a moment ago, they had eyes like dead fish, but now their eyes were sparkling.

<b>

"R-right! Now that you mention it, she did say something like that! If we can't enter, then there's nothing we can do about it! Yeah, that's right!"

<b>

"So at least we won't have to fight in that 'if you let your guard down for even half a second, you'll die' kind of battle from the morning!"

<b>

"I feel like if I enter tomorrow morning, I'll die as soon as I do."

<b>

It seems it was really tough for them. From what I heard, Noah had pulled multiple monsters and was fighting them.

<b>

As I sat down on the empty sofa with a wry smile, Phenon and Shiri stood up and came over to me. Sera also tried to move at the same time but collapsed onto the sofa as if her energy had drained away. It looked like she might fall asleep right there.

<b>

"...This is quite rare."

<b>

Shiri, who sat next to me, then suddenly flopped over and rested her head on my lap. It was the classic "lap pillow" position. While I could understand if it were Phenon or Sera, it was the first time Shiri had done something like this.

<b>

Perhaps aiming for this spot, Phenon sat on the opposite side of Shiri with a dissatisfied expression.

<b>

"Hey Shiri, shouldn't you mainly give that up?"

<b>

"Phenon-sama, I am a member of ASR, and my current position is the same. You often say, 'Right now, I am an explorer.'"

<b>

"Ugh... That's true, but..."

<b>

"Isn't it okay just this once? I'm really tired today."

<b>

As she said that, Shiri moved her head as if searching for a comfortable spot.

<b>

Since it was an unusual action for Shiri, it wasn't surprising that Phenon quietly backed down. Shiri had seen Phenon and Sera getting close to me up close, so perhaps she had some pent-up feelings inside her.

<b>

"Esuaru-san, um, did you dislike it?"

<b>

"Not at all. If this helps relieve my fatigue, bring it on. I'm not tired, so if Phenon wants, I can lend my lap later."

<b>

"Then please let me have a turn after Shiri!"

<b>

"I don't mind being last..."

<b>

Following Phenon, Sera, who was still sprawled out on the sofa, also expressed her desire to join in on the lap pillow. Potions and elixirs don't restore stamina, after all.

<b>

Thinking it was a perk of my role, I decided to rest the heads of the three of them on my lap and pet them.
