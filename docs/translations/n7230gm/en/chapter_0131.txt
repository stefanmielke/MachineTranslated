# A-17 Passing the Baton

<b>

<b>

<b>

B-rank dungeon, fourth layer.

<b>

We had been resting until the countdown was almost up each time we crossed a layer, but Arnold's fatigue was steadily accumulating.

<b>

So far, he hadn't fallen into the same situation as that certain someone who "gets their sword stuck," but it was taking him quite a bit of time to defeat a single orc.

For that reason, the three of us guardians were keeping an even closer watch on Arnold's battle, ready to join in at any moment since entering the fourth layer.

<b>

"Ugh, they're already here!!"

<b>

From behind the orc Arnold was currently fighting, another orc was slowly approaching him, firmly stepping on the ground. This new monster had a clear intent to harm, and it looked like it could charge at any moment.

Arnold seemed unable to decide whether to flee or continue fighting.

<b>

...Is this it?

<b>

"Cela, Noah. We'll take down the orc behind him. At this rate, Arnold's going to get seriously hurt."

<b>

I called out to my waiting companions on either side as I formed the shape to draw my bow, preparing to unleash the magic archer's skill—"Magic Arrow."

<b>

Then, with enthusiasm, Cela replied, "I've been waiting for this!" while Noah tilted his head and said, "I wonder if I can do it."

Despite showing different reactions, both of them started running toward the orc almost simultaneously.

The wind created unintentionally by them blew my hair forward.

<b>

Watching their backs, I released a magical arrow, carefully saving my power to avoid suspicion as I weaved between them.

The attack—of course, hit. The arrow traveled about 30 meters and pierced the orc's right shoulder as intended.

<b>

"Focus on the enemy in front of you!!"

<b>

To prevent Arnold from getting distracted by the sudden change in circumstances, I shouted ahead. Even though there was a threat in front of him that could kill him, I didn't think he would act so foolishly, but just in case.

<b>

Injured in the right shoulder, the orc dropped its weapon, a club, to the ground. It tried to pick it up immediately, but before it could, Noah's fire-type magic exploded in its face.

<b>

With a painful roar, the orc covered its face with its hands. It seemed to have no room to worry about Cela, who was closing in.

<b>

"—Hah."

<b>

Exhaling sharply, Cela swiftly slashed at the orc's leg with her sword. Then, to prevent the enemy from targeting her, she moved her feet and launched further attacks.

She was still faithfully following my teachings, swinging her sword not to deliver a finishing blow but to accumulate damage.

<b>

Noah's magic and Cela's swordplay.

<b>

Having spent over a year in the same party, their teamwork was quite impressive. They understood how each other would move—this was the kind of fighting style they had.

<b>

"—Hey, there's no need to worry about us. It's Arnold, after all."

<b>

Near Cela and Noah, who were quickly incapacitating the enemy, Arnold was struggling to push back the orc's club with his sword.

<b>

"It's not like I can take it down here—"

<b>

Muttering, I pulled out a plain bow from my inventory.

This bow was a drop from a C-rank dungeon, with no special abilities or particularly high power. The arrows were cheap ones sold in stores.

<b>

"Ha, ha—here goes."

<b>

First, I shot a real arrow, then immediately released a magic arrow.

The slight time lag was adjusted due to the difference in firing speed.

Each arrow slipped past Arnold's sides and reached the orc's shoulders almost simultaneously.

<b>

"…Seriously?"

<b>

The magic arrow went exactly where I expected, but perhaps because I hadn't handled a real bow in a while, the store-bought arrow had a deviation of about two centimeters. Even with the hit correction from DEX—still, it was off.

It might look good from the outside, but all that welled up inside me was negative emotion.

<b>

"I've been slacking off on practice… Is this what they call being complacent?"

<b>

While I took in the sight of Arnold trying to make a decisive move while the orc had dropped its club, I let out a deep sigh. It was so deep that it felt like my stomach acid and the sandwich I had eaten during the break might come up.

<b>

As a pathetic instructor like this, I couldn't proudly teach Shiri how to handle a bow.

Had I gotten carried away after defeating Venom and gaining the Overlord class?

<b>

"Maybe I should train alone for the first time in a while."

<b>

Recently, I had been enjoying spending time with my companions too much.

There was also the backlash from having been alone for so long, and I was realizing the joy of teaching someone.

To ensure that I could remain a goal and inspiration for everyone—so they wouldn't be disappointed, I needed to train hard again.

<b>

In the fourth layer where orcs appeared, Arnold declared to us that he had reached his limit, saying, "It seems this is as far as I can go alone."

Even though many people overestimate their abilities and charge in, I found his refusal to turn a blind eye to reality quite commendable.

<b>

After finishing off the enemies in the fourth layer, a countdown timer appeared. We could have chosen to return instead of proceeding, but Arnold's desire to "see the Cyclops" and Cela's hidden feeling of "not having enough fun" aligned perfectly, and we decided to move forward.

<b>

How did I know their inner thoughts? Because a certain little one whispered them to me.

<b>

While the two of them were defeating the ogre in the fifth layer, I was conversing with Arnold, who was resting his body while fiddling with the bowstring.

<b>

"How was it? The B-rank in Lindale?"

<b>

"Indeed, it was a truly fascinating experience. I appreciate you indulging my whims."

<b>

"That's good to hear. If you want to thank someone, tell those two."

<b>

"Of course. But I must also thank SR—what incredible bow accuracy. Even in the midst of battle, it made me momentarily stop moving."

<b>

"That was just luck."

<b>

The timing and the targeted spot were slightly off.

I appreciated his sentiment, but it was a compliment I couldn't fully rejoice in.

<b>

"We have a bowman named Shiri in our party. She's the one who's truly amazing."

<b>

She has also mastered the technique of simultaneous hits. While there are still inconsistencies, she's at a level where there are no issues using it in actual combat. Saying she's better than me wouldn't raise any suspicions.

<b>

I had to say this to avoid the question of "Why are you acting as a support role?" from anyone who didn't know Arnold—or me.

<b>

While Arnold listened to me, his gaze was directed toward Cela and Noah.

<b>

"Noah is wonderful too, but Cela Bernot—her swordsmanship is extraordinary. Honestly, I wondered if Lindale Kingdom was handing out titles too liberally, but… that was a huge mistake. Cela is undoubtedly a talent that comes once in a hundred years, or even a thousand."

<b>

"Yeah, she's amazing."

<b>

Without any false words, I agreed with Arnold's statement.

That level of learning ability was indeed something that comes once in a millennium.

<b>

"From your perspective, who do you think would win in a fight between Shin and Cela?"

<b>

He had calmed down significantly from the "Ha ha!" state I first witnessed.

He was using the honorific "you" toward a commoner like me, so perhaps he was feeling a bit insecure.

<b>

"I think Cela would win in a one-on-one, while in a team battle, it would be like the Lightning Strike. ASR has a shorter history compared to the Lightning Strike."

<b>

To make this statement accurate, I would need to add that it was without me and Noah—but that's a secret.

<b>

"…The Sword Princess, Cela Bernot."

<b>

Arnold spoke my beloved's name as if savoring it.

While his eyes turned into hearts when looking at Noah, the gaze he directed at Cela was entirely serious.

<b>

Somehow,

<b>

I had a feeling that Arnold was about to say something troublesome again, but I wanted to believe it was just my imagination.
