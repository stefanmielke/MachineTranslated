# 16 Starting Up

<b>

<b>

<b>

After parting ways with SR in front of the guild, I immediately headed to the B-rank dungeon located in the northern part of the royal capital. According to the guild master, the Thunderbolt Trail has been diving into this B-rank dungeon every day lately.

<b>

It seems they haven't been diving since morning like SR, but perhaps they still can't give up. I was glad to know that.

<b>

It's still early for the dungeon to open.

I don't know when they will arrive, but if I lie in wait in front of the dungeon, they will eventually show up.

<b>

For Fenon, and to gain SR's trust, I will do whatever it takes to call them to the guild!

<b>

<b>

11 AM.

Two hours had passed since the time I could enter the dungeon. The Thunderbolt Trail finally revealed themselves.

<b>

Noticing my gaze, Shin called out to me with a puzzled expression.

<b>

"…It doesn't seem like you're here for a thank-you visit. What do you want? If it's about the party, my answer hasn't changed since last time."

<b>

In response, the petite woman sitting to Shin's left nodded her head up and down.

If I remember correctly, her name is Suzu, right? She is a priestess, an advanced class of cleric, and is level 80. She looks weak-willed, but she has reached the level cap.

<b>

"Shin is refusing because he cares about you. Please understand that."

<b>

The one sitting to Shin's right—Raika—said. If my memory serves me right, that was her name.

She wears revealing equipment and has a great figure that suits it perfectly. I think I’m decent enough, but I can't compare to her.

Her class is the advanced class of brawler—Berserker. Level 80.

In other words, everyone in the Thunderbolt Trail, including Shin, is level 80.

<b>

"That's not it. I don't want to join your party."

<b>

"Is that so? Then what do you want? We're planning to go into the dungeon now."

<b>

Scratching his head, Shin spoke with a troubled expression.

I took a step closer to them and communicated, "Please keep your voice down," before entering into the conversation.

<b>

"Have you heard about last night?"

<b>

"Last night...? No, I haven't."

<b>

Shin replied to me in a low voice as well.

<b>

"I see. You'll find out eventually, so I'll tell you first. The condition of Her Highness the Princess has worsened. They say we have ten days left."

<b>

"…That's really pushing it."

<b>

Shin said with a strained expression. Suzu covered her mouth to stifle her surprise, while Raika looked down with a sad expression.

<b>

"So, did you come to tell us that today?"

<b>

"No. I came to ask you—Thunderbolt Trail—for a favor. I want you to come to the guild tomorrow morning at 7 AM."

<b>

"7 AM!? That's really early."

<b>

"I'm sorry for the inconvenience on our side, but I ask for your cooperation."

<b>

With that, I bowed my head. This was the second time I had bowed to them.

But immediately, I was told, "Stop that, stop that."

<b>

"That's not necessary. You'll tell us the reason, right?"

<b>

"The reason? Well... I suppose I want you to participate in a discussion."

<b>

"A discussion? About what?"

<b>

"That is…"

<b>

As I hesitated to speak, Shin pressed further.

<b>

"First of all, whose request is that? Is it yours? Or is it from the guild master?"

<b>

I fell silent.

If I say something clumsy now, it might make it harder to bring them to the guild.

What I was asked by SR was not to persuade them but to bring them along.

<b>

"I'm sorry, but I can't say it from my side. But please, I beg you!"

<b>

Again, I bowed my head. This made it a total of three times.

However, this time, there was no immediate response like before. They seemed to be pondering. Perhaps they were suspicious of some kind of trap.

<b>

I waited for their response while sweating nervously.

<b>

Eventually, an unexpected voice spoke up.

<b>

"I think it's fine. I believe it would be painful for Shin, who isn't good at waking up early."

<b>

Hearing those words, I couldn't help but look up.

The speaker was Suzu—the petite priestess girl.

<b>

"Hey, wait a minute, I'm not bad at waking up early."

<b>

"Oh really? You overslept yesterday and today, didn't you?"

<b>

"Ah… well, that's because I've been tired from the dungeons lately…"

<b>

"In that case, we have the same condition."

<b>

"Ugh… that's true, but…"

<b>

Shin was being pressured by the two women. It was a sight I had never seen before.

In my mind, his image was of someone who would respond with a firm attitude in situations like this. Yet now, he was being cornered by two women, slowly retreating while forcing a wry smile.

<b>

"Besides, since Lady Sera, the daughter of the count, is bowing her head like this, no matter what the content is, it should be fine to participate in the discussion, right?"

<b>

"W-we're the top of the country, you know? It's not that easy to just grant requests. Besides, this kind of thing should be allowed after a bit of reluctance—"

<b>

"If Sera hears that, it would be a problem."

<b>

"You really are an idiot as always."

<b>

"Yes, yes."

<b>

What is this?

What am I witnessing?

A comedy routine? Or a lovers' quarrel?

Where did the serious atmosphere from earlier go?

<b>

Shin averted his gaze from them and looked towards me.

<b>

"Ah, well, if it's a request from the guild master and Sera, I suppose I can listen to it."

<b>

"Are you still saying that? Just say it clearly."

<b>

"That's right. Sera is in trouble, you know."

<b>

Rather, I'm the one troubled by this atmosphere. They say the mouth is the source of disaster, so I should just keep quiet.

<b>

Shin scratched his head vigorously and looked down, letting out a big sigh. Then he looked up,

<b>

"Got it… I’ll go. But you better not be late."

<b>

He said that.

<b>

"—Really!? Thank you!"

<b>

Then I thanked each of Shin's party members. They said, "Don't worry about it," but the smooth progress of the conversation was thanks to them joining in.

<b>

SR. I have fulfilled my role.

<b>

From here on, I will trust you and stand tall. The rest is up to you!

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

The next day, we were seated in a soundproof private room with a long table.

In front of me sat Shin, with a furrowed brow. On either side of him were Suzu and Raika, enjoying tea and snacks.

<b>

At the far end of the long table extending straight from the door sat the guild master, arms crossed and eyes closed.

<b>

The time was 7:15 AM.

The seat next to me was still empty.

<b>

"Hey, how long are we supposed to wait?"

<b>

Perhaps losing patience, Shin raised his voice.

<b>

"I'm sorry. Please wait just a little longer. He must be tired too."

<b>

"That's the same for us. We were called at this early hour and are sleep-deprived. I don't know who this 'he' you’re talking about is, but I’m going to voice my complaints."

<b>

No one stopped his words.

Indeed, it would be natural to be angry if the one who called us was late. Suzu and Raika showed no reaction to his words. This means they likely share the same opinion. I couldn't argue against his words either.

<b>

Then, a few minutes later, a modest knock was heard. The door opened.

<b>

"I'm really sorry… I overslept."

<b>

With a wry smile, the awaited person entered the room.

Shin immediately called out in an angry tone, "Hey," but his words didn't continue.

<b>

Neither the guild master nor I could speak. We were at a loss for words.

<b>

Finally, Shin managed to squeeze out a voice that was neither a complaint nor a question about the reason for the summons.

<b>

"—Are you okay?"

<b>

It was a word of concern for SR.

<b>

"Huh? Is something wrong? Is my outfit dirty?"

<b>

With a puzzled expression, SR checked her own clothing.

No, her clothes were indeed dirty, but that wasn't what surprised us.

<b>

"SR. You've got dark circles under your eyes. Plus, your face is overall pale."

<b>

The guild master said with an exasperated tone.

SR clapped her hands as if she understood.

<b>

"Ah, it's just lack of sleep, so don't worry. I've been cutting back on sleep, and I was in the dungeon later than usual yesterday. It might have just shown up on my face all at once."

<b>

Later than usual?

He usually dives into the dungeon until after midnight, and now even later?

<b>

"Please don't overdo it."

<b>

"Thank you for your concern. For now, I feel bad for these people, so shall we get straight to the point?"

<b>

With that, SR sat down in the seat next to me.

<b>

"First, I want to apologize again. I'm sorry for being late after calling you here. My name is SR."

<b>

"I'm Shin, this is Suzu, and this is Raika. By the way, you said you were sleep-deprived because you were in the dungeon, right? The entrance restriction for the dungeon is at 10 PM. I wouldn't expect you to stay that late and end up looking like that."

<b>

"Ah, well, the reason is simple. I wanted to do some training, so I kept avoiding the enemies without defeating them."

<b>

"Where? For how long?"

<b>

The one who raised the question was Suzu, directing an observant gaze at SR.

<b>

"The location was the boss room of a C-rank dungeon. I spent about five hours there from just past midnight."

<b>

"—What!? You did that alone? You're quite the liar."

<b>

Shin shot a mocking glance at SR. Suzu and Raika also looked displeased, as if they thought they had been fooled.

However, I, who had been guarding her for ten days, knew. She was not the type to tell such lies, and she had the strength to back it up.

<b>

In response to Shin's words, she let out a small sigh before answering.

<b>

"Then I trained for just five minutes in an F-rank dungeon. Is that good enough? We don't have time, so let's get to the main topic."

<b>

Perhaps lacking the energy for unnecessary exchanges, SR answered dismissively.

With such an attitude, it seemed likely that it would affect the discussions to come, but I trusted her and kept my mouth shut.

<b>

The Thunderbolt Trail, too, seemed eager to wrap up this discussion quickly, as they did not interject.

<b>

Seeing that the atmosphere had quieted down, SR nodded slightly and opened her mouth.

<b>

"First, let's start with an explanation of the derived secondary classes."

<b>

The status window that SR brought up displayed the unfamiliar title of "Martial Swordmaster."

All of us, including me, were left speechless upon seeing it.

<b>

It seemed that the operation had officially begun.
