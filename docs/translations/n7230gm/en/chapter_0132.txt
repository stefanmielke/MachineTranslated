# A-18 The Power of the Sword Princess

<b>

<b>

<b>

The fifth level was mostly left to Sera and Noah, while I just poked at the orcs with my bow to pass the time.

<b>

I had to be careful not to raise any suspicions with Arnold by being too precise or powerful, so I participated while pretending to be casual.

As I shot arrows that barely grazed the ogres, Sera, who was in combat, turned to look at me with a surprised expression. However, when she alternated her gaze between Arnold and me, she nodded as if satisfied.

<b>

Is it that surprising that I miss my attacks? It happens sometimes, especially when I'm sleep-deprived. Besides, look ahead; it's dangerous.

<b>

<b>

Finally, we finished off the thirty familiar ogres and teleported to the level where the boss awaited.

<b>

"Whoa... this one is big. Its weapon reach is long—getting close will be a challenge."

<b>

As Arnold observed the cyclops for the first time, he immediately began analyzing the enemy.

He placed his hand on his chin and scrutinized it with an expression as if examining a corpse.

Of course, I've never encountered such a situation. Just a feeling.

<b>

Speaking of which, didn't Shin say "There's no way we can win" when he first saw this thing? Back then, the mere fact that it was the boss of a B-rank dungeon might have ingrained the image of "can't win" in his mind, so comparing it to Arnold now seems a bit unfair.

<b>

Arnold has experience clearing B-rank dungeons in Rezell, so it's not surprising that he's familiar with enemies of this level.

<b>

"Is it okay if I handle this alone? I've only been tackling it with a party lately, so I want to confirm if I can take it down by myself."

<b>

Sera asked us, Noah and me, in a calm tone without any particular pressure.

She has experience defeating the 'Cotton Candy' in an S-rank dungeon with me, so she isn't intimidated by a cyclops at this point.

Without much hesitation, we, the faux siblings, replied, "Sure—go ahead."

<b>

However, there was one man in the group who couldn't simply accept her words.

<b>

"Are you really going to challenge the boss alone, Sera?"

<b>

Arnold asked with a worried expression, furrowing his brows.

<b>

"She has experience fighting bosses alone, so there's no need to worry. If things get dangerous, we'll support her, and as long as she doesn't let her guard down, there shouldn't be any danger."

<b>

I haven't let her try yet, but I believe even someone like Shiri or Phenon could take down a cyclops. Their stats are vastly superior compared to those from other countries, and they have plenty of experience fighting strong monsters.

<b>

"I see, so this is what it means to be the Sword Princess. I must also strive to improve."

<b>

"Yeah. We've been steadily leveling up too, so I expect great things from the Rezell Kingdom."

<b>

"Hahaha! I've been looked down upon quite a bit!"

<b>

Arnold laughed while looking up at the fake sky. Since his face was tilted upward, it was hard to tell what kind of expression he was making.

<b>

O-oh... I might have gotten a bit carried away. Is he actually angry about this?

<b>

Because it was easy to talk to him, I completely forgot that he was a noble—and a warrior representing the Rezell Kingdom.

If it turned into a case of disrespect, I'd have no choice but to bow my head to Sera and Phenon and say, "Please do something about this." What a useless fiancé I am.

<b>

Oh no, what should I do? As I struggled to find words, Noah next to me whispered, "He's not really angry." Nice mind-reading! I'll treat you to yakitori next time!

<b>

"With that level of archery, it's no wonder ASR is so confident—both Lady Noah and the Sword Princess are remarkable talents from the Lindale Kingdom!"

<b>

"Haha... Well, my previous words were because our country had the fastest information—so please don't take it too badly."

<b>

"I'm not upset. While I wouldn't mind an unknown party, I've heard that ASR is the second-best in the Lindale Kingdom—I'd like to have a chance to fight against ASR if possible."

<b>

Arnold smiled slyly and looked at me.

That sounds good; I'd definitely like to fight against the representative party from Rezell.

<b>

However, since I'm supposed to be the support role, it seems unlikely that I can enjoy it fully, but it would definitely be enjoyable to watch the battles of those who have trained hard.

<b>

"Both of you, Sera is about to engage the boss. Aren't you going to watch?"

<b>

As the excited men were getting into it, Noah sent a gaze filled with exasperation, as if to say, "This is just ridiculous."

<b>

"Of course, we will watch! Is it alright if I observe from Lady Noah's side?"

<b>

Currently, Arnold was sitting cross-legged on my left, while Noah was sitting in a gymnastics position on my right.

He leaned forward, seemingly forgetting about me, and called out to Noah.

<b>

"Stay still there. You can't concentrate next to Noah."

<b>

But I forcibly pulled Arnold back to his original position before Noah could say anything. It would be awkward if they started getting cozy here. Besides,

<b>

"........... Just watch."

<b>

For some reason, I found myself thinking, "You don't know anything about Noah," or "The one who understands her best is me." I had thoughts of taking a superior position over Arnold. Why is that?

<b>

Fortunately, Arnold didn't argue against my statement and fixed his gaze forward, saying, "You have a point."

When I glanced to my right, I saw Noah was also watching Sera, just like him. She seemed a bit closer to me than before, but—oh well.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

The battle between Sera and the cyclops ended in an instant. It was a complete victory.

<b>

At first, her movements were a bit stiff, but she quickly regained her senses and defeated the cyclops without using any skills.

Currently, her class is a barrier mage, which is a rear guard role, but it doesn't matter much to us who have gained numerous player bonuses. Of course, if she were to fight seriously, she should choose a front-line class.

<b>

"Could it be that she's teaching Shin how to wield a sword? It's not just that she's similar to him; she's clearly more refined than he is—no, that doesn't make sense. If that were the case, ASR wouldn't need to receive guidance from the Thunderbolt Trail—ASR has magical Noah and Princess Phenon, and Shiri, who excels in archery compared to ASR, as well as the Sword Princess. What does this mean...?"

<b>

Muttering to himself.

Arnold was spilling words like a monologue without focusing his eyes.

However, when Sera approached us looking a bit down, he vigorously shook his head. It seemed he was resetting his thoughts.

<b>

"I took a bit longer than expected... I really should do this alone periodically."

<b>

Without paying any attention to Arnold's dog-like gesture of shaking off water, Sera reported with her brows furrowed in an "8" shape.

<b>

"Let's have a debriefing at home."

<b>

In the past, I would have praised her, saying, "Well done, perfect," but she still has room for improvement. That means I have to point out the finer details.

Her footwork, attacks, evasion, transitions to defense—there are countless things to mention, but with her growth speed, she'll master them in no time—she'll probably be able to clear A-rank dungeons alone soon.

<b>

—Now then, our mission is complete.

<b>

It's about time for the Thunderbolt Trail and Arnold to be ready to meet, so let's get out of this dungeon quickly.

Thinking that, I slowly stood up and took Noah's hand, who was gesturing and looking at me to "help her up," and pulled her up. She's really more like a little sister than a goddess.

<b>

"I have a request."

<b>

Just as Sera was about to operate the window to return, Arnold quietly—but clearly—spoke. Everyone's movements halted as he bowed his head vigorously toward Sera.

<b>

"Would you teach me how to wield a sword? The techniques of the Sword Princess are superior to any swordsman I've seen so far."

<b>

This guy, with the Thunderbolt Trail incident and the lolicon commotion, really keeps bringing up troublesome matters...!

But well, regarding this, I can somewhat predict how she will respond, so it's not a big deal.

<b>

Sera briefly glanced at me and Noah before returning her gaze to Arnold.

Then, in a voice clearer and louder than Arnold's earlier one—

<b>

"I refuse!"

<b>

She declared decisively.

Of course.
