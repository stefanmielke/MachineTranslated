# 40 Golden Right Arm

<b>

<b>

"So, what brings you here at this hour? Without any prior notice, could it be that you're running away at night?"

<b>

Lord Drag said with a grin directed at Ms. Phenon. In response, she answered smoothly with a dignified attitude.

<b>

"I would prefer you to call it a love escape."

<b>

That's not it. Not at all.

<b>

In fact, if it were a love escape, I would become an absolute harem guy. Moreover, surrounded by beautiful women and girls, the chances of being stabbed by men on the streets would drastically increase.

<b>

"Ah ha ha! So the rumors about the hero being infatuated are true!"

<b>

"Of course. He is the brave one who worked himself to the bone to obtain an elixir for someone he didn't even know—there's no man other than Lord SR who interests me more than a grain of sand."

<b>

That's scary, Princess. Could you please say it in a slightly gentler way?

<b>

"I see, I see. Then, it means that Lord SR and I will eventually become relatives. Please take good care of Phenon."

<b>

Don't just move the conversation along on your own.

I haven't said a word about marrying Ms. Phenon, you know? Right now, I have other things I want to do more than romance.

<b>

I decided to ignore the exchange between the two and attempted to redirect the conversation.

<b>

"I came today to ask the Duke for a favor—please grant us permission to enter the currently sealed B-rank dungeon."

<b>

I don't know the first thing about negotiation, and even if I did, convoluted exchanges are a hassle. I conveyed my request to Lord Drag directly.

<b>

"I also request this, Uncle."

<b>

Right after my words, Ms. Phenon followed up.

Lord Drag put his hand on his chin and appeared to ponder for a moment.

<b>

"I can't believe it, but... is Phenon planning to dive into the dungeon as well?"

<b>

"Yes. That is my intention."

<b>

When Ms. Phenon answered, Lord Drag shook his head with a serious expression.

<b>

"No, that's not possible. It's too dangerous. Do you really understand what you're trying to do? The B-rank dungeon is a place where explorers who have trained themselves to the limit can lose their lives."

<b>

"I am fully aware of that. Besides, I will be diving with Lord SR and Sera, so there is no danger—right, Lord SR?"

<b>

Oh, so I'm being called out here.

<b>

"That's right. If Sera and I are with you, Ms. Phenon—Your Highness, there will be no danger."

<b>

Lord Drag murmured "Hmm" and looked at me with an evaluative gaze.

Why is he only looking at me? Look at Sera too, old man.

<b>

"...I cannot gauge the abilities of Lord SR and Sera. It will have to be judged by the guild master of Reinas."

<b>

Speaking of the guild master of Reinas, that would be Regulus's younger brother, right? I believe his name was—Lailes?

If it comes down to it, I can just contact Regulus.

<b>

Just as I was about to let out a sigh of relief, Lord Drag said, "However..."

<b>

"Once a rule is established, it cannot be changed so easily. Even if it's a request from the hero, Lord SR, or Phenon. If a new profession becomes accepted by society, I will consider lifting the seal."

<b>

If it becomes accepted by society... how many months later is that?

If I were solo, I would want to dive in right now, but can I really wait for that?

I exchanged glances with Ms. Phenon, Sera, and even the previously silent Ms. Shiri, and I confidently took out the legendary elixir from my inventory.

I silently placed it on the table and slid the bottle toward Lord Drag.

<b>

"What is this?"

<b>

"What do you think it is?"

<b>

I returned a question with a question.

I know it's rude, but Lord Drag showed no signs of dissatisfaction as he picked up the bottle containing the elixir and held it up to the ceiling light. His face was tinted a pale green.

<b>

"It's not a potion... I've never seen anything of this color before."

<b>

Lord Drag was pondering, "Hmm," while gazing at the bottle containing the elixir. If he had the other hand, he would probably be resting his chin on it.

<b>

As a payback for surprising me with his prosthetic hand earlier, I clearly stated the identity of the liquid he was holding in a loud voice.

<b>

"That is an elixir."

<b>

"—Huh!? W-What—"

<b>

Lord Drag jumped in surprise. In that moment, the bottle containing the elixir slipped from his hand.

<b>

With exclamations like "Ah!" and "Eek!" sounding out simultaneously, the sound of glass breaking followed, and then the splatter of liquid echoed.

<b>

For a brief moment, everyone was silent.

<b>

Even with one less elixir, it's not a significant loss. I still have a few spares in my inventory, and I can always obtain more if I want to.

<b>

However, I was startled by the sound of the glass breaking.

<b>

"Uncle, do you understand what you've just done...?"

<b>

".................."

<b>

When addressed by Ms. Phenon, Lord Drag turned pale and showed no reaction.

<b>

"That was a genuine legendary elixir—an elixir, you know? I can testify as someone who has actually consumed it. The liquid that was in the bottle you broke was definitely an elixir. You understand the value of it, right? You know how difficult it is to obtain and how much danger one must face to get it."

<b>

Ms. Phenon pressed him with words that seemed to be a follow-up.

<b>

But why is that?

She must know that I can easily obtain elixirs, yet the way she said it makes it seem like she is threatening her own uncle.

<b>

"...Lorentz."

<b>

Seeking help, Lord Drag called out to the butler who had been blending into the background.

Upon being called, Mr. Lorentz bowed his head with a gentle expression toward his master.

<b>

"Thank you for your service until now."

<b>

"Lorentz!?"

<b>

How heartless, Mr. Lorentz! You just abandoned him so easily!

<b>

After uttering those harsh words, he swiftly collected the scattered shards and wiped the wet table and floor.

Even while saying thank you for your service, he diligently performed his duties as a butler.

<b>

Ms. Shiri and Sera watched their exchange with wry smiles, and I let out a dry laugh of "Hahaha." What are we doing?

<b>

In contrast to us, Ms. Phenon spoke in a serious tone.

<b>

"Then, Uncle. Of course, you will prepare accommodations and meals for all of us, as well as grant us entry to the B-rank dungeon, right? Do you have anything to say, Lord SR?"

<b>

The flow is quite different from what I had planned, but it seems to be a good outcome.

<b>

He was nodding vigorously at his niece's words, and Ms. Phenon was moving the conversation along without waiting for his response.

At this point, I feel like I could ask for all his wealth, and he would agree. Of course, I have no intention of saying such a thing.

<b>

"Then, since we're at it, let's have him prepare equipment for everyone except me. Sera, do you need anything? How about you, Ms. Shiri?"

<b>

When I asked the two, they shook their heads and hands sideways.

After all, he is a duke, so it's understandable to feel hesitant.

<b>

Even though this is payback for being teased, it feels a bit cruel to corner someone of a higher status like this.

I took out another elixir from my inventory and placed it in front of Lord Drag. Please don't break this one.

<b>

"Now, this is my final request. Please drink this."

<b>

"W-What is this...?"

<b>

"It’s an elixir. You just saw it a moment ago, right?"

<b>

"N-No way!? Why is a legendary elixir appearing so easily!?"

<b>

"I've dived multiple times with the Thunderbolt Trails. So this is the last one, so please don't drop it."

<b>

Although I dove solo and it's not the last one, it's a hassle, so I let him believe the lie.

Lord Drag gulped and cautiously picked up the bottle containing the elixir.

—But then, he immediately returned it to the table and let go of the bottle.

<b>

"I can't accept a second one..."

<b>

"Uncle, this is a request from Lord SR, you know?"

<b>

When Ms. Phenon said that, he furrowed his brow and stared at the elixir. After about ten seconds of silence, Lord Drag once again picked up the bottle, opened the lid, and gulped down the elixir in one go. The sound of liquid flowing down his throat echoed in the quiet room.

<b>

—Then,

<b>

"—Oh!"

<b>

The voice of surprise was not only from him, who had consumed the elixir.

I didn't check each person individually, but surely everyone in this room must have shown some kind of reaction.

<b>

Lord Drag's body glowed faintly as if he had used a recovery spell, and from his lost arm onward, it was truly golden—radiating a dazzling brilliance that blurred even its outline.

<b>

When the light subsided, he was touching his right hand as if cherishing a child.

With only one hand, he couldn't touch his own hand—such a gesture was only possible because he had both hands.

<b>

With tears in his eyes, Lord Drag turned his gaze to his right hand and spoke.

<b>

"I don't know how to thank you... SR, my lord. What can I give you in return?"

<b>

His gaze turned toward me.

It felt like he was saying, "Please let me repay you for anything."

<b>

Even if you ask what you can give me in return, I really only want permission to enter the B-rank dungeon, and I don't need money. It would be a problem if you insist on repaying me.

<b>

Just as I was about to ask the opinions of the other three, I turned my face toward Sera.

<b>

Kuu.

<b>

That silly sound came from her stomach.

In an instant, Sera dominated the air in this tense room.

<b>

"W-What was that sound just now?"

<b>

Saying that, Sera looked around, but her gaze couldn't capture the source of the sound.

It's your stomach, down there. Don't you realize it yourself?

<b>

Everyone except the bewildered Sera let out exasperated laughs.

<b>

"Shall we prepare a meal first?"

<b>

Mr. Lorentz said with a smile.

It was as if he had completely forgotten about the earlier "thank you for your service," behaving very naturally.

<b>

The master and servant were having a back-and-forth during the meal, saying things like "You were going to abandon me, weren't you!?" "Of course, that was just a joke."

<b>

It seems they have a good relationship after all.
