# A-3 Changed Explorers

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing the meeting regarding the dungeon regulations, we received five servings of tea sweets from Regulus-san and exited the private room.

Once we made it to the hall of the Explorer Guild, we found Sera and the others talking at a tavern table.

<b>

The surrounding scruffy explorers could not even muster the courage to speak to them, merely sending glances their way.

Aren't you all in a life-threatening profession? What’s with that naive attitude?

<b>

Well, even a third party observing the situation would likely not tease them. It’s only natural for it to be that way, I suppose.

<b>

After all, the other party consists of a countess renowned for her martial prowess and the princess of this country. Even if they are here as explorers, it’s unlikely anyone could easily approach them.

Siri seems somewhat approachable, but she is beautiful enough to make anyone hesitate to speak to her.

<b>

If there were a man acting alongside such women, it would be obvious he would become a target of jealousy. Yes, that would be me.

<b>

However, the jealous gazes directed at me have significantly decreased compared to the world before the collapse.

<b>

I’m not sure if I can call it friendly, but in any case, it has become easier for people to approach me. It likely has something to do with the fact that I no longer hold the title of "Hero."

<b>

“Hey, SR! Don’t keep the princesses waiting too long!”

<b>

On my way to the table where Fenon and the others were, one of the explorers, who had been drinking heavily, called out to me. The surrounding drunks chimed in, “Yeah, that’s right!”

You guys were here before I even talked to Regulus-san, right? How many hours have you been drinking?

<b>

“I’m with Noah, so it can’t be helped.”

<b>

When I replied to the explorer, I patted Noah’s head, who was walking slightly behind me.

It seemed that this nameless explorer had not quite seen Noah, as he widened his eyes in surprise.

<b>

“Oh... this is Lady Noah. To be able to behold her delicate figure so closely... I am a fortunate man. And yet, you are as beautiful as ever... I feel like I can strive for the rest of my life now.”

<b>

“R-really? That’s great to hear.”

<b>

Even the former creator god seemed to be intimidated by the sudden appearance of a lolicon, as she was responding while using my body as a shield.

<b>

“Hey. If Lady Noah... or Lady Sera, Lady Fenon, or Lady Siri are ever in danger, you will act as a meat shield to protect them! Got it!?”

<b>

“Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it, so don’t call me a meat shield. I’ve been training properly, you know.”

<b>

“Hmm... Speaking of which, you’ve been learning techniques from the people of Thunder’s Trail, haven’t you? Man, you’re just envious in every way.”

<b>

“Well, that’s how it is. Just drink in moderation, okay?”

<b>

Waving my hand lightly as I said that, the other person waved back in the same manner. And then――,

<b>

“Well then, see you later, Explorer-kun.”

<b>

As Noah followed behind me and said that, the man straightened his back as if electricity had run through him, and he saluted with lightning speed. The explorers watching around him displayed similar movements. Is this a military?

I kind of understood, but isn’t their attitude way too different from mine? You guys.

<b>

With a wry smile alongside Noah, I headed toward the table where Sera and the others were seated. Then Sera called out to me with a slightly dissatisfied expression.

<b>

“Were you being bothered again?”

<b>

She said this while directing a somewhat stern gaze toward the explorers. Even without looking at where Sera was staring, I could tell that the explorers were in a state like frogs being glared at by a snake.

<b>

“Well, something like that. But it’s not like I was bothered in a bad way, and conversations among men are usually like that.”

<b>

“I see, then that’s good.”

<b>

“Yeah, thanks for worrying about me.”

<b>

Upon hearing my response, Sera’s expression returned to her usual bright self. In fact, she seemed even more cheerful than usual. Perhaps she was happy to hear my words of gratitude.

<b>

That aside.

<b>

“Have you finished your business, Sera and the others?”

<b>

“Yes! Everyone went to visit their families and reported on their recent activities.”

<b>

In response to my question, Fenon answered with a smile.

Actually, they had said they would “participate in the meeting,” but they would likely end up being bored, and since they had come all the way to the royal capital, it would be better to visit their families―― so they had taken separate actions from us.

<b>

“I see. Well, I’d like to say we’re done with our business in the royal capital, but according to the information from Regulus-san, it seems that Shin and the others will be returning here soon.”

<b>

“Oh... that will certainly make things lively.”

<b>

When she said “lively,” she didn’t mean that our surroundings would become noisy. It meant the entire country would become lively.

<b>

“Yeah... I wanted to hear a bit about it, but I guess it’s impossible?”

<b>

“Indeed. Winning the International Martial Arts Tournament is a very honorable achievement, and it seems preparations for the ceremony are also underway at the royal castle. They will likely hold a parade as well, so it might be difficult for a while.”

<b>

Siri said with her eyebrows furrowed in a troubled manner.

Since the news of Thunder’s Trail winning reached the Lindell Kingdom, the entire country has been in a festive mood. When the actual participants return, there will undoubtedly be a commotion.

<b>

“Don’t Fenon and Sera have to participate in the ceremony?”

<b>

Noah suddenly asked as if she had just thought of it.

<b>

Indeed.

<b>

Since it’s a ceremony, it seems like Sera, who was awarded a title just like Thunder’s Trail, and Fenon, the first princess of the country, should participate. Haven’t they been invited?

<b>

“I declined.” “I turned it down.”

<b>

Seeing the two answer as if it were obvious, I couldn’t help but feel a bit taken aback. You two are quite free, aren’t you?

<b>

“My father and Dino were nagging about it, but I ignored them! We all want to go to the dungeon!”

<b>

“I’m in a similar situation. I told my father and brother that I’m ‘not interested.’ They scolded me, but it’s not a problem.”

<b>

“No, that is a problem.”

<b>

Aren’t my fiancées a bit too strong-willed? Is it possible that in the future, I’ll be the one being bossed around?

Siri is muttering, “I think it would be better to attend...” but unfortunately, her faint voice doesn’t reach the ears of the two.

<b>

“Is this really okay...?”

<b>

Perhaps because they have been fighting alone in a world with no one else, they try to stay with me as much as possible. I appreciate their feelings, but sacrificing something for that is not good.

If this causes them to become estranged from their families, it would be a disaster.

<b>

For now, I’ll listen to their opinions while trying to encourage them to participate in the ceremony.
