# 87 Disappearing Companions

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"It's over...!"

<b>

Finally, I completed 50 runs of the A-rank dungeon.

How long did it take in terms of days? I don't think it took a month, but since I wasn't living a regular life of waking up in the morning and going to bed at night, I can't remember the exact numbers.

<b>

Glancing at the boss that had turned into particles, I checked my status and found that I could now change to any of the third jobs. It seems that the conditions for changing to a third job are the same as in the game, which is a relief.

<b>

I quickly spammed the 'Return' option that appeared after defeating the boss. Maybe it was because I had achieved my temporary goal, but a sudden wave of sleepiness hit me. I just wanted to sleep quickly.

<b>

When I transferred outside the dungeon, the sky was beginning to brighten. It was probably around six in the morning?

Torches flickered around the buildings, and as usual, the soldiers were on guard to ensure no one approached the dungeon. They were doing a good job.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work!"

<b>

As I walked out of the dungeon, one of the soldiers bowed while making a clattering sound with his metal gear. I replied with a short "Thanks" and headed straight home.

<b>

"I wonder what caused this change of heart...? Did someone order them to do this?"

<b>

I muttered quietly so the soldier wouldn't hear, glancing back briefly.

What I was questioning was their change in attitude.

<b>

I had been ignoring the entrance time regulations and had been flaunting my power by diving into the A-rank dungeon. I had rejected all requests for meetings from the prime minister and guild master of this country, and if anyone tried to stop me, I silenced them with the royal family's dagger.

I didn't want to fill my head with unnecessary information and thought it would be a waste of time.

<b>

The guards had been flustered by my brazen behavior, but for some time now, they had been greeting me with what seemed to be 'full of energy'.

It was convenient not to have to deal with them each time, but it felt a bit eerie.

<b>

As I looked at my approaching home, I let out a big sigh.

<b>

"The problem is from here on out..."

<b>

It's not that leveling up my third job is troublesome or that I'm scared of fighting Venom.

What I'm really worried about is what kind of impact will occur in this world when I conquer the S-rank dungeon that I will challenge next.

<b>

Of course, I haven't been ignoring that thought until now.

<b>

Will the speed at which the world breaks down accelerate?

Or will it completely collapse as a result of my conquest?

Or will nothing happen at all?

<b>

I considered various developments, but in the end, I could only speculate, and nothing would be resolved.

However, if conquering the S-rank dungeon would completely destroy the world, and if Sera and the other members of the Thunder's Trail were still in this world, I would at least like to say goodbye to them.

<b>

Thank you for your help— 

I will definitely save this world, so please believe in me— 

<b>

That said,

<b>

"I probably seem like I've gone crazy... saying the world is breaking down— or something like that. Sera left a note saying she was going to meet with Shin, so she must have consulted with the Thunder's Trail about what I said— it would be painful if they looked at me with disdain."

<b>

Haha— I let out a dry laugh, tinged with self-deprecation.

Well, even if they looked at me like I was a strange person, if they were still here and I could see them, if I could exchange a word or two, maybe I should be happy about that.

<b>

<b>

I arrived at the door of my house and unlocked it.

I didn't feel like saying "I'm home" to this empty house, so I silently took off my shoes. No, I tried to take them off. With my index finger resting on the heel of my shoe, I froze.

<b>

"...........I'm home."

<b>

I murmured in a voice that felt like I was squeezing it out.

In front of my gaze were four familiar shoes.

One was Sera's, and the other three, if my memory served me right, belonged to the members of the Thunder's Trail.

<b>

"I see... everyone is still safe."

<b>

...I'm glad. I can still talk to them.

<b>

As I thought that, I looked at the various shoes with different shapes and designs, and I noticed that one of them—likely Laika's—was becoming transparent. Moreover, if I wasn't imagining things, its transparency was gradually increasing.

<b>

Faced with that mysterious phenomenon, I couldn't speak or move my body. I was frozen as if I had been paralyzed.

I could only stare blankly at her disappearing shoes.

<b>

"Ah..."

<b>

A sound that I wasn't sure could be called a voice escaped from my throat.

<b>

I reached out to the spot where Laika's shoes had just been, but there was nothing to touch. Her shoes had completely vanished, as if nothing had ever been there in the first place.

<b>

Fenon disappeared, Shiri disappeared, Regulus-san disappeared, and now, likely Laika has disappeared.

<b>

Until now, it had been happening without my noticing, so I hadn't expressed much emotion.

However, witnessing it happening right in front of me felt like an overwhelming sense of loss, as if a person had died. I crumbled to my knees on the spot.

<b>

A single tear rolled down my cheek and dripped from my chin.

Then, as if all the emotions I had been holding back burst forth at once, a flood of tears streamed down from the corners of my eyes.

<b>

"What the hell have I done!?"

<b>

I slammed my fist down on the floor.

The stone floor caved in, and cracks spread out like rays.

<b>

"Why are you making me suffer!? Why does this world have to break down!?"

<b>

My emotions exploded like a balloon filled with air bursting.

I struck the ground with my fist again. Stone shards pierced my skin, and blood began to flow.

<b>

"Damn it, damn it!"

<b>

Like a child throwing a tantrum, I hit the floor several more times. I didn't care what state my hands were in, nor did I feel any pain. I just wanted to vent this pent-up anger somewhere.

<b>

As I continued like that, suddenly, I felt someone's hand touch my shoulder.

And between the floor and my fist, someone else's hand had somehow gotten caught.

<b>

"—Hey... Esuar, aren't you being a bit too forceful?"

<b>

When I looked up, there was Sera, dressed in loungewear, looking at me with a wry smile. Her expression reminded me of a pet owner who had been bitten by their dog. She seemed to be trying to smile at me while enduring the pain.

<b>

Her right hand was resting on my shoulder, and her left hand was probably... having its fingers broken by my fist.

And behind her were Shin, yawning sleepily, and Suzu, still wearing her nightcap.

<b>

"Whoa, whoa, a good-looking guy is ruined. What's with that face?"

<b>

"Sera, Esuar. Use this."

<b>

Suzu said as she pulled out two bottles filled with emerald green liquid from her inventory.

<b>

"—What!? Suzu, isn't that an elixir!?"

<b>

"Elixirs are easy to come by. Besides, if they're going to disappear, it's better to use them while you can."

<b>

"Ugh... that's true. It feels like such a waste, though."

<b>

"You really are stingy... for a count's daughter."

<b>

"What did you say!? Shin, you said just the other day in the royal capital, 'Give me an extra skewer,' didn't you!? You have more money than you know what to do with!"

<b>

"Th-that was more like a conversation with the old man—"

<b>

Excluding me, who was dumbfounded, Sera and the others were happily chatting away.

Even though Laika had disappeared, they were completely unaware, oblivious.

<b>

I was happy that they welcomed me warmly, and despite the fact that a companion had vanished, seeing them talk as if everything was normal made me feel incredibly sad, and I once again let out a sob and cried like a child.
