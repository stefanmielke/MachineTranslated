# 75 Friend's Visit

<b>

<b>

<b>

A few days after receiving a message from Raires.

As expected, the three members of Thunderbolt's Trail came to our house.

<b>

Since they visited in the morning, they probably arrived in the city of Reinas yesterday and stayed overnight at an inn before coming here. If they had come straight to my house, I would have lent them my bedroom.

<b>

They greeted us with "Excuse us" and immediately began to explore the house, just like when they visited the doghouse at the royal castle. You guys are really curious, aren't you!

<b>

Of course, we followed along and showed them around the rooms, so we weren't infringing on anyone's privacy. They also didn't just enter rooms on their own.

<b>

Siri prepared tea and coffee for each of us, including Thunderbolt's Trail, and just as she took her seat, Shin spoke up.

<b>

"It's a bit smaller than the house in the royal capital, but it's a nice place. I actually prefer this house."

<b>

"Yes, yes. A house that's too big feels uncomfortable."

<b>

"We're starting to want a house of our own too."

<b>

Thunderbolt's Trail gave their various impressions. All of them were positive words, making me feel as happy as if my own child was being praised. Not that I have any children, but you know?

Once the topic about the house settled down, I shifted the conversation to our exploration activities.

<b>

"How's the level grinding going? You're currently diving into an A-rank dungeon, right? How many floors have you reached?"

<b>

When I asked, Thunderbolt's Trail suddenly had grinning expressions. It seems they are making good progress in their exploration.

<b>

"We've made it to the fifth floor. We've seen the boss once, but we're still in the observation phase."

<b>

"Ah, so you returned via emergency recall."

<b>

"Yes, yes. It's a shame to lose the dropped items, but if we can gather information on the boss, it's worth it."

<b>

"I've only tried long-range attacks with magic and bows, but it seems manageable."

<b>

Oh.

So, Thunderbolt's Trail is close to conquering the A-rank dungeon. I thought they would be fine given their skills, but their pace is quite fast.

<b>

"Don't overestimate your abilities. It's game over if you die."

<b>

I spoke in a deliberately heavy tone, warning Thunderbolt's Trail not to get carried away. I don't want my newly made friends to die here.

Unlike in games, there's no resurrection here, so a moment of carelessness can easily extinguish the flame of life.

Shin received my advice and smiled wryly, saying, "I get it."

<b>

"We're being careful enough without you telling us. The knights and other explorers are getting stronger, but they're still not at our level, and there's no need to rush."

<b>

"That's good to hear, but please be careful."

<b>

"Yeah, yeah. You should worry about yourself more than others. You're probably doing some dangerous level grinding, right?"

<b>

"No, not at all."

<b>

I replied with a serious face.

After all, there's only the A-rank dungeon, right? Even if I wanted to do some risky level grinding, there's no higher dungeon to go to.

<b>

"Even if you don't think so, from the outside, it looks dangerous..."

<b>

Raika said in an exasperated tone.

In agreement with her words, Shin and Suzu nodded along. Looking to the side, even my party members had their eyes closed, arms crossed, and were nodding in agreement.

<b>

It seems I'm fighting in a dangerous manner.

I never intended to do so at all.

<b>

After having lunch with seven people, since Thunderbolt's Trail came all the way to Reinas, we decided to have a mock battle in the afternoon. They would be staying at this house tonight, so we could discuss "that topic" in the evening.

<b>

The venue for the match was the plains surrounding the house. Since fire magic hitting the house would be problematic, we kept a safe distance and prohibited fire magic. There's a possibility that sparks could fly to the house and create a huge bonfire. It's made of wood, after all.

<b>

As the soldiers looked around in confusion, I explained, "We're going to have a mock battle with Thunderbolt's Trail," and soon soldiers from the duke's house and the royal family gathered around. Hey, what about your work?

<b>

Ignoring the gathered soldiers, just like during the martial arts tournament, I had a mock battle with Thunderbolt's Trail alone, and the three of Serah, Phenon, and Siri, excluding me, also fought against Thunderbolt's Trail.

<b>

"---You all have gotten way too strong, princesses!?"

<b>

After the match ended.

Although I managed to win against Serah and the others, Shin was out of breath and lay on his back on the ground. His heavy breathing could be heard even from a short distance where I was judging.

The soldiers who were watching the match looked stunned. Of course, they'd be shocked to see the princesses they were trying to protect become this strong.

<b>

"It was a good match between Serah and Shin."

<b>

"Serah is impressive, but the other two are not to be underestimated either..."

<b>

"Yes, yes. I'm quite tired."

<b>

Though not as much as Shin, Suzu and Raika also looked tired and sat down on the ground. It was a good match after all.

<b>

As for my party members, they were clearly downcast. The three of them created a gloomy atmosphere, as if it had turned night just in that spot. It felt like a wake.

<b>

Being downcast means they were frustrated from losing.

With that feeling, they would surely become stronger from now on.

<b>

"Good job. There are various issues to address, but it was a good match. If you can fight that well against Thunderbolt's Trail, that's impressive."

<b>

After all, they are the best party in the kingdom. They're not opponents you can beat overnight.

<b>

"...I'm sorry for not being able to do better despite receiving guidance from Esuar."

<b>

Phenon said weakly, keeping her face down.

<b>

"My guidance isn't anything special. There's no need for Phenon to apologize. Besides, you managed to push Thunderbolt's Trail this far in a party that's not even a year old. Honestly, I think you all will catch up soon."

<b>

When I said that, Phenon nodded, and Siri said in a lackluster voice, "I'll do my best."

<b>

They don't need to feel so down. I think they did well enough that I want to pat their heads like Mutsuo-san and say, "Good job, good job." Simply put, the difference in experience and effort compared to Thunderbolt's Trail is significant, so losing is understandable. If the instructor were more skilled, they might have won.

<b>

".................."

<b>

As for Serah, she was just sulking.

Even without speaking, her frustration was palpable. She looked like a child who couldn't win the leftover pudding in a rock-paper-scissors game.

<b>

I placed my hand on her shoulder and said, "Let's win next time," with just that one line. Saying too much wouldn't reach her ears right now.

<b>

Serah silently nodded, but firmly.

I want her to use that frustration as fuel to become stronger and stronger. If I could wish, I hope she becomes as strong as me—no, even stronger and becomes my goal.

<b>

If she continues to grow at this abnormal pace, by the time I fight the Demon King Venom, there's a possibility that Serah's strength could catch up to mine.

<b>

Perhaps the first person to defeat Venom in this world won't be me, but Serah. Even without my "eye," she has the "sense" to mimic at a level that could be called a copy.

If she can incorporate a variety of techniques and effectively turn them into her own power, she will surely transform.

<b>

I'm really looking forward to it.

Of course, I don't plan on being easily caught up to.
