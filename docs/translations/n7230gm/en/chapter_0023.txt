# 22 Preparation Exercises

<b>

"Since it might be difficult to suddenly change roles, I'll take over Sera's position. I've seen how to fight, so I think I can manage."

<b>

As we transferred to the fifth layer, I said this to Shin.

<b>

Suzuki was keeping an eye on our conversation while also remaining vigilant of our surroundings, and Laika was supporting Sera.

<b>

"If you're okay with that, then I don't mind... but are you sure about this?"

<b>

"Yes. More than that, it's the only option we have."

<b>

Shin frowned at my words.

I couldn't tell if it was concern for my stamina or worry that it might put the party members in danger. It could be a combination of both.

<b>

They had already cleared up to the fourth layer, so I couldn't push them too hard physically. I should aim to defeat the enemies as quickly as possible.

If even one of them were to fall, it would make progressing through the dungeon significantly more difficult.

<b>

The real problem is my lack of VIT.

☆Status☆

Name: SR

Age: 18

Occupation: Martial Arts Swordsman

Level: 32

STR: D

VIT: E

AGI: D

DEX: F

INT: G

MND: F

Skills: Presence Detection, Anticipation

<b>

<b>

This is my current status.

My VIT is E. In other words, it's the third lowest.

<b>

During the game era, the minimum requirements for challenging a B-rank dungeon were at least one B and two or more Cs, according to the operators.

Shin's stats, after all his hard work, look like this even with player bonuses included.

<b>

<b>

☆Status☆

Name: Shin

Age: Mid-20s

Occupation: Swordmaster

Level: 80

STR: C

VIT: D

AGI: E

DEX: F

INT: G

MND: F

Skills: Presence Detection, Sky Sword, Adversity, (Double Slash)

<b>

<b>

Suzuki and Laika have similar stats.

It shows just how much we are pushing ourselves to delve into the dungeon.

And indeed, the Thunderbolt's Trail, challenging a B-rank dungeon with these stats, is quite formidable.

<b>

However, no matter how skilled they are, they must be accumulating fatigue in their bodies. I should be mindful of their condition while we fight.

<b>

<b>

The monsters in the fifth layer are ogres.

Their height is about the same as the orcs we fought earlier, and they don't carry weapons, but their muscle mass is nearly doubled. They're really beefy.

<b>

It's common to deal with such muscle-bound opponents using magic or bows, but currently, there are no ranged attackers in our party. I can draw a bow, but at this point, my arrows wouldn't inflict much damage.

<b>

Currently, Shin is charging at the first monster, while Laika is positioned to the left and I am to the right. We are surrounding the ogre in a triangular formation.

<b>

Shin is skillfully dodging the ogre's attacks while ensuring it doesn't focus its attention elsewhere.

<b>

"Alright, I'm going in too."

<b>

I dashed in from the ogre's diagonal rear and slashed at its side with my black blade. I cut again, and then once more. I kept slashing the same spot repeatedly. Small wounds gradually widened with each cut.

<b>

"Hey! SR! You're overdoing it!"

<b>

Shin, the party leader, called for a retreat. The ogre's attention had shifted toward me.

But for me, this was the expected flow. I hadn't discussed this in advance to prove to them that this method was viable.

<b>

"Shin and Laika, attack from the ogre's back. I'll attack from the front."

<b>

I avoided the ogre's downward fist by turning my body sideways, then placed my foot on its arm and lightly leaped. I swung my sword, twisting my body to crush both of its eyes. Alright, I've taken away its vision. This is what you would call a part destruction in game terms.

<b>

With the three of us attacking together, the ogre vanished in no time. Compared to when we defeated the orc, this was certainly faster.

<b>

"You were really strong... or rather, how long has it been since the fifth layer was cleared? If we manage to accomplish this, it would be quite the feat, wouldn't it?"

<b>

While watching the ogre dissipate into particles, Shin spoke in a daze. If it truly hadn't been cleared for hundreds of years, then it must indeed be an impressive achievement. To me, it felt like, "Huh?"

Besides, the fifth layer isn't the goal anyway.

<b>

"I'm sorry for doubting you."

<b>

"I'm sorry too."

<b>

I received apologies from Suzuki and Laika. I didn't really mind it now. They were cooperating with me like this, so there was no need to bring it up again. I waved my hand and replied, "It's fine, don't worry about it."

<b>

"I told you! SR is strong!"

<b>

Sera puffed out her chest proudly. However, that action seemed to have affected her injury, as she closed one eye and grimaced, "Ugh..."

<b>

"Ah, ah, you're injured. Don't shout or move around recklessly. What will you do if more monsters come? There are still 29 monsters wandering around in this layer."

<b>

"I-I’m sorry..."

<b>

Sera's shoulders drooped. She is still the same, full of emotions, swinging from joy to despair. But I'm glad to see she's doing well.

<b>

"This is how the flow is. Everyone, please be careful with your stamina while fighting. Now, let's defeat the remaining monsters."

<b>

As I called out, Thunderbolt's Trail nodded in agreement.

At first, Shin would draw the monsters' attention, and during that time, I would accumulate as much damage as possible. Once the attention was on me, we would launch a full-on attack together. I find it easier to fight when I'm being attacked.

<b>

This strategy is quick and minimizes the danger to Shin and Laika.

I'll have Suzuki keep an eye on Sera's condition while continuing to maintain vigilance around us.

<b>

<b>

After about two hours, there were three monsters left.

And at this point, I decided to withdraw from the front lines.

<b>

Until we are spotted by a monster, I will rest with Thunderbolt's Trail, and once we are engaged in combat, I will leave it to them.

<b>

Shin and the others must be exhausted, but thanks to the breaks during the fights, we managed to defeat all the monsters.

It took three hours to defeat 27 monsters, and about one hour to take down the last three. I think they did well to hold on.

<b>

Having finished off the last monster, the countdown timer was already activated.

<b>

"I'm sorry, I couldn't take much time."

<b>

Shin apologized to me, breathing heavily.

But there was no need to apologize. They had done more than enough. Even if he was a strict instructor, I couldn't help but praise their results.

<b>

After all, they had already been fighting for nearly 12 hours.

<b>

When I checked the status window, it showed that it was 10 PM. Since we had entered the dungeon at 10 AM, we had been inside for almost a full day.

Despite it being midnight outside, the dungeon remained brightly lit, disregarding the time.

<b>

"No, thanks to you, I was able to rest a bit. Let's head out when the timer hits 30 seconds left."

<b>

I was currently sitting cross-legged on the ground, while Sera was lying down using my lap as a pillow.

Laika seemed tired as well, sitting with her legs stretched out on the ground, gazing up at the sky.

<b>

"Haah, haah—SR, are you really okay?"

<b>

Laika asked with a fatigued expression.

<b>

"Yes. I've been able to take it easy so far, so I think I can fight well."

<b>

"I feel like you've fought enough already..."

<b>

"Compared to everyone else, it's just a little bit."

<b>

Suzuki seemed to want to say something but ultimately just said, "I see."

After our first battle, I think their trust in me had increased.

However, they still likely felt that challenging the boss of a B-rank dungeon alone was dangerous. Shin called out to me.

<b>

"I'll prepare for an emergency return, so don't push yourself."

<b>

When diving as a party, everyone returns together.

If someone chooses to return, even if I'm being attacked by a monster, I can instantly escape from the dungeon.

While this has its advantages, it also has the disadvantage that if someone like Sera gets injured, we can't send just one person back.

<b>

"Thank you. But please don't press it until I decide to."

<b>

I wouldn't want them to panic and choose to return when I'm still in a comfortable position.

<b>

"Understood. I'll let you know."

<b>

"Yes, please do."

<b>

I said with a smile. Thunderbolt's Trail and Sera both looked somewhat anxious.

Well, that anxiety will likely be dispelled as soon as the battle begins. I hope they can firmly engrave my fighting style in their minds and use it as a resource for their future adventuring lives.

<b>

<b>

Now, it's time for the decisive battle.
