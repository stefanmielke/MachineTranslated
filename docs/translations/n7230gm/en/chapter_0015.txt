# 14 Good Changes and Bad Changes

<b>

<b>

“Faaah… I’m sleepy.”

<b>

Early the next morning after achieving the conquest of the C-rank dungeon, I was heading to the Explorer's Guild as instructed by Sera.

It was still early for explorers to be out and about, but the horse-drawn carts loaded with goods were already running through the city. Merchants are robust.

<b>

My level as a Martial Swordsman has risen to 9. As expected, the level-up is slower compared to primary jobs. It will take at least another 6 days to reach level 30, where the player bonus activates.

<b>

“Haa…”

<b>

Recalling yesterday's level-up made me sigh.

It was completely inadequate. Of course, I conquered it without injury, but I became distracted thinking about Sera, and my VIT was insufficient, leaving me exhausted. In short, it was a terrible state.

My pride as someone who has reached the top is in tatters.

<b>

At this rate, it might be a bit problematic.

<b>

I’m confident I can defeat a single boss with a 100% success rate, but I have to go through quite a bit of combat to get there. In other words, I need stamina.

<b>

“After the Martial Swordsman, should I level up the Heavy Knight or the Barrier Mage?”

<b>

Both of these professions have a VIT player bonus at level 30. Ideally, I’d like to level both, but I probably can’t afford to be that leisurely.

I was told it would last for a month, but there’s no guarantee of that, and even now, the princess must be suffering. The sooner, the better.

<b>

Initially, it was said that there were 19 days left, including today. However, if I have 13 days, I can secure at least the minimum stats. Let’s make our move then.

<b>

Back in the game days, I never had to worry about stamina like this… After all, forcing myself to level up like this, no matter how much experience and skill I had, my body just couldn’t keep up.

<b>

And then, my other worry.

<b>

“Sera…”

<b>

Somehow, I felt like I was confessing and waiting for a response. And for me, who has experienced this three times, it was an unpleasant feeling. I’ve been rejected every time.

<b>

Remembering unnecessary things only made me more despondent.

<b>

“Haa…”

<b>

Once more, a deep sigh.

Drooping my shoulders, I trudged toward my destination.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Just before arriving at the guild.

When the building came into clear view, I spotted a red-haired woman standing in front of the guild.

<b>

I had suggested that she not overdo it—hoping she would take my invitation, but it seems I was secretly expecting her to accept. As proof, I was able to spot her from quite a distance away.

<b>

Eventually, Sera noticed me too, and when we were just a few meters apart, she bowed her head vigorously. Then, she spoke in that position.

<b>

“First, let me apologize. I’m sorry for using the word ‘talent’ regarding your accumulated efforts and abilities.”

<b>

I was surprised. No, I was genuinely surprised. I was so shocked that my vocabulary diminished.

I thought that conversation had somehow ended ambiguously, and I never expected a noble like her to bow to someone like me. Moreover, her way of addressing me had changed from “you” to “you” in a more respectful manner.

What on earth had changed in her feelings?

<b>

Still surprised, I also apologized to Sera.

<b>

“...I’m the one who should apologize. I lost my temper. I hadn’t talked about the past, and it’s understandable that you, who know nothing, would think that way.”

<b>

Receiving my words, Sera lifted her face. She had an extremely serious expression.

<b>

“I trust you. I promise not to betray you or overdo it.”

<b>

Those words were the conditions I had laid out while raising my finger. In other words, she was agreeing to my invitation.

After a brief pause, she said in a louder voice.

<b>

“So, please trust me too, SR! I want to be by your side!”

<b>

...Huh?

<b>

“Wanting to be by my side, is that a proposal?”

<b>

“—Huh!? N-no, that’s definitely not it! I meant I want to learn by your side!”

<b>

Sera’s ears and face turned bright red as she edged closer. She seemed angry, but it was different from the coldness I had seen before.

So, I couldn’t help but laugh.

<b>

“Hahaha! Just kidding!”

<b>

“...Honestly. You shouldn’t tease someone older than you.”

<b>

“I’m sorry—wait? Did I tell you my age, Sera?”

<b>

“Ah. When I saw your status before, it caught my eye. You’re 18, right? I’m 22, so I’m four years older.”

<b>

Oh, I see.

That’s about all I could think. It was as expected, considering her appearance.

<b>

“I see. There are various things I want to talk about regarding the future, but first, let’s finish the conversation with Regulus.”

<b>

“Understood. I’ll be waiting seated at the guild’s tavern, so you can go.”

<b>

“No, Sera, let’s go together. It should be fine, I think.”

<b>

It’s probably just a matter of asking about the progress of the dungeon exploration. She knows I’m a summoned human. From Regulus’s perspective, it shouldn’t matter whether she’s there or not.

<b>

“Understood. If SR says so, let’s go together.”

<b>

She nodded with a motivated expression.

I was pleased with her change as I opened the door to the Explorer's Guild.

<b>

“The guild always serves this snack and tea, doesn’t it? Don’t you get tired of it?”

<b>

“SR is special. It’s rare to even be guided to a private room, you know? Even if you were guided, I’ve never seen snacks served.”

<b>

“Is that how it is?”

<b>

“That’s how it is.”

<b>

In our usual private room, enjoying the cookies and tea that were served as usual, Sera and I continued our light conversation. This was something that would have been unimaginable before. After all, I had been told, “I don’t intend to have any conversation beyond the bare minimum.”

<b>

Even while waiting, as we talked like this, time passed in the blink of an eye.

<b>

“Sorry, sorry. I didn’t expect to come so early.”

<b>

A few minutes later.

As usual, Regulus entered the room with a knock that didn’t wait for a response.

<b>

“No, but it’s almost time for the dungeon to open, so please be brief.”

<b>

Regulus said, “Understood,” as he sat on the sofa. He looked back and forth between me and Sera. Then, with a smirk on his face,

<b>

“So, who fell in love first?”

<b>

He dropped a bombshell.

<b>

“—Huh!? What are you talking about!? Sera and SR are not in that kind of relationship!”

<b>

“...I’m saying there’s no time to talk about that, so please be brief. We don’t have much time.”

<b>

He watched our reactions, nodding, and then murmured, “I see,” as if he understood something.

<b>

“As SR said, there’s no time. The jokes end here.”

<b>

You were the one who brought it up.

As I cursed him in my heart, “You bald!” Regulus’s expression turned serious as he began to speak.

<b>

“Actually, I just wanted to hear about SR’s situation, but I could add something to discuss. Sera—well, that’s fine. It’s probably important for you too.”

<b>

What could this be about?

I tried to predict various things, and one worst-case scenario popped into my head.

Please, let it not be that. I hope my predictions are wrong.

<b>

But that wish was not granted.

<b>

<b>

“Last night, the princess’s condition worsened. The deadline is in 10 days.”
