# A-120 Experiencing Death

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

If it's Jade and Crescent, then it's my turn next, right――!

<b>

I walked through the field, eagerly searching for monsters, but I only encountered one wolf monster that Jade had fought. It was defeated in an instant. At least ten should have appeared.

<b>

And feeling unsatisfied, we decided it was time to return and report―― so we left the dungeon. From there, we would have a reporting session with Regulus-san.

<b>

It seems that, as I had heard from Ideya-sama beforehand, dungeons like the one that appeared in Lindell had emerged in various countries, and they were apparently waiting for our report. Sorry for the wait.

<b>

If they had overheard our conversation in the dungeon, they would surely have been angry... For now, I told Regulus-san something like, "We were gathering information to make a proper report." I received a side-eye for that, though.

<b>

"By the way, if everyone reported, I wouldn't have needed to leave the dungeon, would I?"

<b>

After finishing the report to Regulus-san at the guild in the royal capital, I realized this.

That's right. There was no need for everyone to report together. It was more like an emergency return, and since there were no drop items, it was just logging out. We could have done it individually instead of all together.

<b>

"That's unfair to go ahead!"

<b>

"I understand how you feel, but if you enjoy it all at once, it might be boring afterward, you know?"

<b>

In response to my statement, Crescent pouted while Jade chuckled.

Well, that's true. I feel like I was a bit too hasty. I should calm down.

<b>

"After all, the only ones who can really act are the S-Ranks. There are those who have cleared S-Rank dungeons in other countries, but it would be impossible without the S-Ranks."

<b>

"That's right. We need to work hard so we don't hold back the S-Ranks."

<b>

"I don't feel like I can catch up."

<b>

Sera, Fenon, and Shiri each spoke up.

The three of them seemed to be modest, but at least I think the possibility of us Earth group catching up has greatly increased compared to before.

<b>

After all, from now on, it's okay to die. It's fine to do some reckless exploration.

But I don't really know how much pain it would be to die in that dungeon or what kind of suffering I would experience.

<b>

...It seems like it would be better for someone to be a test subject.

Regulus-san would probably want that kind of information, so I think I'll sneak out and try it tonight.

<b>

After returning home to the party house in the royal capital, I passed the time listening to stories from my parents, who had been sightseeing with the guards.

<b>

Sera probably wanted to spend time with her parents, so she returned home, and Shiri and Fenon also went back to the royal castle. Crescent and Jade seemed to have booked a room, but Noah was just casually hanging out with me. That said, we mostly stayed in the room, lazing around.

<b>

As night deepened, it became midnight.

<b>

According to the rules of dungeons in this world, entry is only allowed from 9 AM to 10 PM, but I think I'll take advantage of my current position. If I bow my head and ask, I feel like they might let me in.

<b>

I quietly left the house, trying to make no noise, and walked through the nearly deserted night streets. Of course, I was heading toward the new dungeon. Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to dive into the dungeon tomorrow due to death penalties, but this is an important test.

<b>

I don't want to ask Crescent and Jade, and it would be even worse to let Sera and the others experience it first. The one who has died the most, which is definitely me, is the most suitable.

<b>

<b>

<b>

There were only two guards watching the dungeon.

<b>

I remember that it was a rule to suppress excessive immersion in exploration and manage the entering explorers, but currently, there are few people who have cleared S-Rank dungeons, so the security is low.

<b>

Since it was a newly created dungeon, there were no walls restricting entry around it, and there was no way two people could manage a stone-paved stage that was about fifty meters in diameter, which could be entered from all directions.

<b>

I thought about sneaking in without being noticed, but I didn't want the guards to get in trouble later.

<b>

"So, please let me in."

<b>

"But, you see..."

<b>

The guard looked troubled.

However, if I told Sera and the others, "I'm going to die for a bit!" they would definitely stop me. I think Regulus-san would direct his anger only at me if I explained it properly. So please.

<b>

"I'll apologize to Regulus-san myself, okay?"

<b>

As I said this and put my hands together and bowed my head, I saw someone passing by me and stepping onto the stone-paved stage. When the guard exclaimed "Ah!", she was already out of reach. The guard's hand was repelled by the barrier because she hadn't cleared the S-Rank dungeon.

<b>

"...Why are you here?"

<b>

When I asked that, she grinned, lifting the corners of her mouth.

<b>

"Big brother, did you forget that I can read minds? I know exactly what you were planning to do."

<b>

Saying that, she didn't wait for my response and transferred into the dungeon. Even if she heard my shout of "Hey!", she probably wouldn't have stopped.

<b>

"---!? That idiot!"

<b>

Probably, Noah is trying to experience death in my place.
