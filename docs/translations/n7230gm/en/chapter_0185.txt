# A-68 To Lindale

<b>

<b>

<b>

After the match, I healed the members of "Crimson Sword" with the priest's area healing magic—Area Heal. I checked to see if anyone was in pain, but it seemed there were no issues.

Well, even if there were problems, I could just splash them with an elixir and everything would be fine... Once again, fantasy is amazing.

<b>

"Good job, SR."

<b>

First, Sera called out to me, followed by the other members offering their words of encouragement. By the way, Niz-kun was gently patting the shoulder of the dazed guild master.

<b>

"Thanks, Sera—actually, why don't you all take the time to have another match? Since Noah cheated at the start, it wasn't much of a training session, right? We're about to head back to Palmour, and if we wait to have another match, it might be years before it happens!"

<b>

When I said that, the smallest one in the group glared at me with a pout.

<b>

"Hey, big brother? What do you mean by cheating?"

<b>

"Because that was a tactic like Venom's."

<b>

Using gravity magic to immobilize us at the start and then trying to finish us off with lasers from his eyes is a common tactic of the Overlord Venom. Most newcomers die instantly.

Well, Noah didn't follow up with eye beams after the gravity magic, but maybe she could have...

<b>

"I can't do that! Can you stop with that delusion?!"

<b>

"What? You can't do it?"

<b>

"I'd be troubled if you were disappointed!?"

<b>

As I pretended to be dejected, Noah raised her voice in protest.

Just teasing her got this reaction... Is she really older than me? Maybe gods actually have a lower mental age.

But then again, the creator god of Earth, Idea-sama, had a loli-like design... It's a tough call.

<b>

While teasing Noah and chatting with Sera and the others, the members of "Crimson Sword," who had been resting on the ground, began to stand up one after another. It seemed their stamina had recovered.

<b>

"If the girls are up for it, then we’d like to ask for a match too."

<b>

"I'll ask as well."

<b>

"But let us rest for another five minutes."

<b>

It seemed that Neska and the others were motivated. They probably weren't satisfied with the earlier match against Noah. It felt like the decision had come too quickly while they were still confused.

<b>

"Since it's a rare opportunity, how about trying without Noah? We may have the upper hand in levels, but in terms of teamwork and actual combat, I think 'Crimson Sword' would have the advantage."

<b>

"You’re not suggesting that SR's husband should join in, right...?"

<b>

"Shall I join?"

<b>

"Please don’t, I beg you."

<b>

I was bowed to by the man who was called Carl with such intensity.

If you reject me that much, I might just cry, you know? ...I feel a bit pathetic.

<b>

So after a short break, a match was held with three members of ASR excluding me and Noah against five members of "Crimson Sword."

The result was a loss for ASR. Sera was facing two opponents, but she was focused on taking down Shiri and Phenon and ended up losing.

<b>

When we had a three-on-three match next, this time ASR won.

<b>

It was impressive to see Shiri and Phenon with serious expressions, perhaps because they were frustrated about losing to Neska and the others. Before the match, they had said, "We can't let SR's face get any more mud on it!" So it might have been more important to them not to tarnish my reputation than the fact that they lost.

<b>

If asked whether I was happy or not, well, it would be the former.

They don't really need to worry about me.

<b>

After that, we continued our friendly mock battles until it got dark.

In the end, Carl got really into it and said, "Let's somehow land a hit on SR!" and we ended up having a match with a total of eleven people, including Niz-kun, the guild master, and the members of ASR.

Of course, I dodged everything.

The number of battles I've been through compared to you all is different, ha ha ha!

<b>

Please consider it a non-issue that Noah's magic grazed the tip of my shoe and that Sera's sword scattered a few strands of my hair.

<b>

A few days after the mock battle with Neska and the others, we boarded a carriage in the morning to return to the Kingdom of Lindale. I had already said my goodbyes to "Crimson Sword," His Majesty the King, Niz-kun, and other acquaintances the day before, so there was nothing left undone.

<b>

Well, even if I had forgotten something, it's not like I can't come back again, so it shouldn't be a problem. It took five days by carriage, but with my status, I could probably shorten that significantly if I really tried—though I definitely wouldn't do that.

<b>

As if savoring the moment, we progressed through the streets while gazing at the scenery outside. Even though it was just a trip, we had been there for several months... It felt a bit lonely.

<b>

But more than that, I was looking forward to returning to the Kingdom of Lindale.

I was excited to see the newly expanded house, the capital of Lindale, the townspeople, my acquaintances among the explorers, and the Thunderbolt Trails. We surely had a lot to catch up on.

<b>

If I were to explain to my past self, "This is what your future will be like," I would probably just be laughed at.

I could imagine being told, "Are you making fun of the idea of being reborn in a game world?"
