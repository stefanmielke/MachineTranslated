# 6 Provocative Style

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next morning, contrary to my expectations, I woke up early. It seems that the tension from not having an alarm clock worked in my favor.

<b>

After having breakfast at the inn, I bought some skewers on the way to the Explorer's Guild and headed to my destination while eating them.

I had only put tea and cookies in my stomach yesterday, so it's no wonder I'm hungry.

<b>

When I arrived at the guild, the same receptionist from yesterday guided me to a private room. Her posture was so straight that I wondered if she had a wooden sword hidden in her back. She didn't need to be so tense; I'm not a noble or anything.

<b>

"Is it time yet?"

<b>

And once again, I was leisurely sitting in front of tea and cookies. I had already been like this for 30 minutes. It's déjà vu.

<b>

Just as I took a bite of the last cookie on the table, there was a knock at the door. Before I could respond, Regulus-san entered. Right behind him was the red-haired woman I had seen arguing at the reception yesterday.

<b>

She said she was from a count's family, right? Should I stand and greet her?

<b>

Thinking that, I tried to stand up, but Regulus-san stopped me with his hand.

<b>

"Ah, no need to stand up. Come on, Sera, sit across from him."

<b>

"…Understood."

<b>

Prompted by the guild master, the red-haired woman—Sera-san—sat on the sofa opposite me. She was observing me with a scrutinizing gaze.

To escape that uncomfortable gaze, I spoke to Regulus-san.

<b>

"What happened to my story?"

<b>

"Don't rush. I'll talk about that now. For now, let's at least greet each other—just to be clear, your status doesn't matter as an explorer."

<b>

Is this an arranged meeting? Not that I have any experience with that.

While I was internally making that remark, Sera-san spoke up.

<b>

"I am Sera Bernault."

<b>

A very brief introduction. When I replied similarly with "I'm Esuar," she narrowed her eyes slightly and asked.

<b>

"…What is your family name?"

<b>

Family name? NPCs from the game didn't have family names for commoners, did they?

Could it be that Sera-san mistakenly thinks I'm a noble?

<b>

"I don't have a family name. I'm a commoner."

<b>

When I answered that, she looked a bit surprised and replied shortly with "I see." It seems she was indeed mistaken. I'm glad I corrected it early on.

<b>

After a few seconds of silence, Regulus-san opened his mouth. By the way, he had been standing the whole time. His head was reflecting the light from the ceiling throughout the room.

<b>

"Now, I'll explain. First, Sera—this Esuar is the target of your protection. The deadline is ten days. This is a punishment for you, so no objections are allowed. I've also received approval from Count Bernault."

<b>

Sera-san didn't say anything in response to his statement. She simply clenched her fists on her lap.

As for me, a question mark floated in my mind.

<b>

"Um… what do you mean by protection?"

<b>

When I asked that, Regulus-san gave me a deadpan look.

<b>

"Think about your position a little. Lord Dino was in a panic, saying, 'I never thought you'd dive into a dungeon on the first day.' It seems they had already arranged for surveillance."

<b>

Lord Dino—ah, the prime minister.

Could it be that they intended to assign me protection later? And what do they mean by surveillance? Was I being stalked by someone? I had no idea.

<b>

"I don't really need protection."

<b>

"This is something the king decided. There's nothing I can do about it."

<b>

"Then please tell the king. It's uncomfortable to be watched."

<b>

"Don't be so selfish."

<b>

"That's a natural right."

<b>

I'm trying to enjoy my life in another world, and being watched like this is unpleasant. I mean, who would be happy about being monitored? If there is someone like that, they're a HENTAI.

<b>

"Esuar is a level 1 of a lower class job, right? This is a necessary measure."

<b>

"I'm not level 1. I've reached level 5."

<b>

"One and five aren't much different."

<b>

You bald jerk! Not only is your head shiny, but your mind is also rigid!

<b>

"Ugh… fine. It doesn't matter. I'm planning to go to the royal castle again anyway, so I'll persuade them myself."

<b>

I had been asked to share stories about the other world. Plus, I need to check on the princess's condition while exploring; it would be terrible if her condition suddenly worsened. They said she would last a month, but that's uncertain.

<b>

"—W-wait a minute!"

<b>

Sera-san interrupted our conversation with a panicked tone.

<b>

"Why are you talking about the king and Lord Dino!? And how can you casually say you're going to the royal castle… wasn't Esuar a commoner!?"

<b>

I see. This person doesn't know anything about me. It would indeed be strange for a mere commoner to say they would "persuade" the country's leaders.

<b>

As I pondered how to explain, Regulus-san spoke without hesitation.

<b>

"Ah, it seems that when the people of the royal castle tried to summon a hero, they ended up summoning a level 1 jobless person from another world. This guy is that otherworlder."

<b>

"So I'm level 5!"

<b>

I'm not level 1!

<b>

"When summoned, you were level 1!"

<b>

Now that I think about it, that was true! I reflexively argued back.

<b>

When I looked at Sera-san, she was staring at me with a blank expression, looking quite foolish. It ruined her beauty.

<b>

According to Regulus-san, she had signed a confidentiality agreement before entering this room. The content was that what we discussed here must never leak outside.

<b>

After a moment of being stunned, Sera-san nodded as if she understood.

<b>

"So, protection. It does seem necessary."

<b>

"No, I really don't need it."

<b>

I hope we don't reach that conclusion.

Even in my current level 5 state, I am confident I can defeat most people in this world. At the very least, if I can't clear a C-rank dungeon, they won't be able to defeat me.

<b>

"I understand the protection issue for now. Please tell me about my side of the story."

<b>

I pretended to accept it, but internally, I was not convinced at all.

I thought that if I could win against the conqueror of a D-rank dungeon in a one-on-one match, their opinions would change, so I decided to move the conversation forward.

<b>

"Ah, I discussed that matter thoroughly with Lord Dino. It seems your proposal is fine with him."

<b>

Oh! Awesome! I don't know if they are being considerate of me or if they think it's an easy win, but either way, it's lucky for me.

<b>

"However, if Esuar loses, we will have to assign proper protection—this is the condition. It might have been a good opportunity for Lord Dino as well; it gives a good excuse to assign protection."

<b>

"Any excuse is fine. Let's do it quickly! Who is my opponent?"

<b>

As I leaned forward and asked Regulus-san, he smiled with a smirk.

<b>

"Your opponent is right in front of you. Sera is a level 60 advanced class 'Swordmaster'—the D-rank conqueror you desired."

<b>

"Sera-san is my opponent!?"

<b>

What!?

I didn't expect that!

<b>

—But it wasn't surprising.

<b>

I had heard her arguing at the reception desk yesterday, so I knew she had conquered a D-rank dungeon, and given that she was here today, it was easy to imagine she would be my opponent in a one-on-one match. The protection issue was genuinely unexpected, though.

<b>

But a level 60 Swordmaster, huh? Her stats are probably heavily skewed towards STR and VIT.

Based on my gaming knowledge, I quickly visualized her stats in my mind.

<b>

<b>

☆Stats☆

<b>

Name: Sera Bernault

Age: Early 20s (estimated)

Occupation: Swordmaster

Level: 60

STR: C

VIT: D

AGI: F

DEX: F

INT: G

MND: G

Skills: Presence Detection, Flying Slash

<b>

<b>

Presence Detection is a skill that senses enemies behind or in unseen places, while Flying Slash is a skill that sends out slashing attacks. Each of these skills can be obtained at level 25 for swordsmen and level 40 for swordmasters.

Additionally, there is a skill called "Double Slash" that can be obtained at level 50 for swordsmen, but I don't know if she has that.

You can change to an advanced class at level 30 without needing to max out at the lower class's maximum level of 50.

<b>

Those skills aren't particularly strong, and not many players who played the game leveled up to 50.

<b>

"What's wrong? Are you getting scared? I can always cancel the one-on-one match if you want. Of course, in that case, you'll also have to accept protection and give up on exploring E-rank dungeons and above."

<b>

Regulus-san said with a grin—but when our eyes met, his expression quickly stiffened.

That was probably because I was smiling just like him.

<b>

Now, STR doesn't matter as long as I don't get hit, but having high VIT is a slight concern for me. If the match has a time limit, I might run out of time before my opponent surrenders.

<b>

So, to ensure my victory, I decided to put on a little act.

<b>

"There's no way I'm scared. After all, Sera-san looks incredibly weak, and you haven't even cleared a C-rank dungeon, right? I should be able to win easily."

<b>

"Hey, hey—why are you saying such provoking things!? And are you really from another world!? You shouldn't know the difficulty of a C-rank dungeon!"

<b>

Now that I think about it, that was the setting. I ended up speaking as if I knew.

<b>

"Well, let's keep that a secret…"

<b>

I couldn't come up with a good excuse, so I decided to remain silent for now.

<b>

"—Hehe, hehehe. This is the first time in my life I've been mocked like this."

<b>

Sera-san was laughing while showing an expression of rage. Even a demon mask would have more charm than that.

She looks scary, but I'll push her a little further. For the sake of the princess, please forgive me.

<b>

"Mocked...? I was just stating the facts. Oh, regarding the match, how about this? Since it doesn't seem like a fair fight, if you can land even one hit on me, then you win. If I lose, I'll gracefully work hard in an F-rank dungeon."

<b>

Upon hearing my statement, Regulus-san looked dumbfounded and muttered, "Are otherworlders really this foolish...?" It was disrespectful to everyone on Earth.

<b>

And as for my opponent, Sera-san,

<b>

"If you say so, then let's have the match with those conditions. Don't worry; I'll kill you with a single blow."

<b>

She was exuding a murderous intent as if she was about to strike across the table.

The more aggressive the opponent, the easier it is for me to take control. I'm relieved that she reacted just as I expected.
