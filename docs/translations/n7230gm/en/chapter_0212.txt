# A-95 To Rezel

<b>

<b>

<b>

A few days since Jade arrived in this world.

She had been acting together with Crescent, but each of them dived into B-rank dungeons solo and quickly earned enough money for building a house.

<b>

It seems they feel a bit guilty, thinking, "It feels like we're cheating," but there's no choice but to get used to it quickly.

<b>

In my case, I started at level 1 right after reincarnation, so it’s still manageable... but Crescent and the others were already at max level from the start.

<b>

Collecting A-rank or S-rank drops could be a source of funds, but unlike the guaranteed drops in the B-rank dungeons here in Lindale, it’s better to seek elixirs if you want to earn steadily. Using the word 'steady' for a way to earn enough to build a house in a week might be questionable, though.

<b>

"Esuar, why did you dodge to the left just now? I think just bowing your head would have been enough."

<b>

"Esuar, you changed your grip a bit, didn’t you? Why is that?"

<b>

"Esuar, are you careful not to let the effect of the White Lotus wear off?"

<b>

When I suggested, "Shall we have a mock battle?" to her, who is a demon lord by profession and uses the same weapon, White Lotus, I ended up being bombarded with questions. It's good that she's eager to learn, but when she asks, her face is too close. Could you please keep a little distance, old man?

<b>

The location was a vast meadow in front of the house, with three spectators: Sera, Pheno, and Shiri.

Crescent was nearby acting as a referee and a cheerleader, saying things like, "Go for it, Princess!"

After that, we tried a two-on-one match, but honestly, there was a concern that we might seriously injure each other, so it couldn’t be a full-power match.

<b>

Well, even considering that, I was very satisfied. I was able to have a heated battle after a long time.

<b>

"So, what will you two do? We're heading to the S-rank in Rezel, so we'll be leaving Lindale."

<b>

Initially, it was a bit hard to leave Crescent alone in this country, so it was decided that she would come with us, but since Jade is here, I thought it wouldn’t be a problem.

I asked, and the conclusion was that the two of them would come with us.

<b>

"Rather, I can't stand the anticipation of the house being completed, so it’s better to do something else to distract myself!"

<b>

"That’s true. If it’s not a bother, I’d like to tag along too."

<b>

Thus, in addition to our ASR members, two strong individuals would accompany us to Rezel.

Let’s take it easy until they get accustomed to this world.

<b>

I thought that way, but they were accepting this world much faster than I had expected.

I, too, had dived into dungeons from the very first day of my reincarnation or transfer, so this might be normal for someone addicted to Tempest.

<b>

So, after reporting to the kings, guilds, and the Trail of Thunder, we departed from the Kingdom of Lindale and headed to the neighboring country of Rezel.

We traveled in several carriages, including those for escort, crossing the border while passing through multiple towns, and finally arrived at the royal capital of the Kingdom of Rezel.

<b>

We had informed this country in advance through magical tools that we were coming, so we received a warm welcome right after crossing the border and came this far with the dignitaries of the Kingdom of Rezel—but—

<b>

"I didn’t hear that the second princess was participating in a martial arts tournament..."

<b>

As we entered the royal capital and proceeded towards the royal castle in a carriage, I quietly spoke to Sera beside me.

From the carriage ahead, I could hear the cheerful voice of Princess Katariya. Apparently, they seem to have known each other for a long time, and she had visited Lindale both when Pheno was suffering from illness and after he recovered. By the way, I couldn't hear Pheno's voice, who should have been talking with her.

I think it's just that Princess Katariya's voice is too loud for us not to hear.

<b>

"Wow! Lindale is really advanced!"

<b>

When Princess Katariya spoke in a way that didn’t quite suit a royal, a woman in armor walking outside the carriage shot a sharp glance at her.

She probably noticed it—Princess Katariya's dissatisfied voice saying, "It’s okay sometimes," could be heard.

<b>

They must have a very casual relationship. Plus, since she’s participating in a martial arts tournament, she must be quite an active character.

<b>

When Princess Katariya first encountered us, she spoke with such a relaxed attitude that I thought, "Is this person really royalty?" Her communication skills are very high.

However, while I’m fine with interacting with royalty, it seems Crescent and Jade are still not used to it, as they remained stiff the entire time.

<b>

Well, the two from the same hometown are getting along with Pheno, so they’ll probably get used to it eventually. Whether getting used to it is a good thing or not, I don’t know.
