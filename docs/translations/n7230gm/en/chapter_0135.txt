# A-21 It's Impossible

<b>

I'll give it my all.

<b>

It's relatively easy to say it myself at my preferred timing, but when asked to practice it by others, it becomes extremely difficult.

<b>

Though it differs from what Noah meant, for me to fight seriously means to 'kill' the enemy. In a game ranking match, there's no time for holding back, and there's no need to go easy on monsters.

<b>

In other words, fighting without killing the opponent is a very difficult combat method for me.

<b>

However, in this world that has become real rather than a virtual space, I can't say something that disregards ethics like "Sorry if I kill you." Even in martial arts tournaments, murder is a clear violation of the rules, and the rules in games do not apply in this world.

<b>

--Up to this point, it's a matter of my strengths and weaknesses, but the biggest problem lies elsewhere.

<b>

"If it's okay to hold back, then that's fine, but what will you do?"

<b>

I ask Jill, who has a serious expression after Noah's "Do you want to die?" remark.

She maintains that expression and shifts her gaze to me.

<b>

"You've never seen me fight, have you, SR? Where does that confidence come from? I have the strength to be chosen as a representative of the country, you know?"

<b>

She expects something from me, but she doesn't like being underestimated too much—her current feelings might be something like that.

<b>

"Explaining it is... hmm, it's a bit complicated."

<b>

Aside from the seven who have memories from before the collapse, no one knows about STR and such. So, if I say there's too much of a status difference, all I can expect is for her to tilt her head in confusion.

<b>

"It's not so much about technique; I'm far stronger than you guys. If I don't hold back, even a wooden sword could easily cause a fatal injury."

<b>

If she had acquired a lot of status bonuses like Sera and the others, it might be different, but explorers who have just started to dabble in secondary derived jobs are no match for me. The otherworldly powers of SS and SSS status cannot be withstood by an average explorer.

<b>

"You don't look like it, though."

<b>

"You wouldn't know my level unless you looked at the window. I have a little secret."

<b>

"...Hmm. You have a lot of secrets, don't you?"

<b>

Jill squints her eyes, increasing the suspicion in her gaze.

Indeed, from an outsider's perspective, I might seem like someone who only talks big, and her reaction might be normal. I haven't proven anything; I'm just being lifted up by those around me.

<b>

"If you think I'm lying, that's fine, but please don't spread rumors about me."

<b>

"I'm not saying you're a liar! You avoided my attack, and Sera Bernot, who has a title, praises you this much. It's certain that you're strong."

<b>

But if you can't see it, you won't understand—Jill added in a small voice.

Since the soundproofing is effective, I can't hear any voices from other customers. The room was quickly filled with silence.

<b>

This is an awkward atmosphere—I thought, when suddenly someone with a title hiccuped, disrupting the mood. Then, in a daze, they muttered something incomprehensible like "feifuu." Is that a language from another world?

<b>

"Ugh—ku..."

<b>

I almost burst out laughing, but if I did, I'd be labeled as someone who can't read the room, so I desperately held back, shaking my body. The girl sitting next to me, who looks like a child, also bowed her head and clenched her fists.

<b>

"Jill, why don't you just show him the match against Shin or the Sword Princess? If SR and the others agree... but..."

<b>

Arnold, who had been silent, attempted to support his sister.

The girl who received the support asked in a small voice, "What do you think?"

<b>

"If Jill is satisfied with that, then I'm fine with it. However, Noah is stronger than Shin and Sera... so if you want to see a one-on-one, it might be better to go with her."

<b>

"Even so, she still doesn't come close to big brother."

<b>

"That's a lie... then why doesn't this little one have a title!? That's strange!"

<b>

"I'm not planning to overexert myself. I have no interest in fame at all."

<b>

"Really, what a strange pair of siblings—you two."

<b>

"Hehe—birds of a feather, right?"

<b>

Why are you so happy about this? We're being treated as weirdos.

To express my dissatisfaction, I deliberately let out a loud sigh and finally started to eat.

<b>

"I want to keep my trump card hidden, so I'll fight without skills."

<b>

The skills of the third job haven't been made public yet, and showing off the overwhelming prowess of the Overlord is out of the question.

Upon hearing my words, Jill pouted and gestured with both hands as if in disbelief.

<b>

"That's fine. You really like to hide things, SR."

<b>

"That's fine, right—so Jill, you're really satisfied just watching me and Noah fight? Arnold, please keep quiet about me and Noah."

<b>

"Yes. It's a bit hard to imagine that Noah-sama and SR are stronger than Shin and Sera, but... I'm looking forward to it."

<b>

Thanks to Arnold's supportive remarks, the conversation finally started to come together.

Sera had already slumped over the table and drifted off to dreamland. It looks like I'll have to carry her home again.

<b>

The Vinzett siblings seemed to sense the atmosphere relaxing and began sharing their thoughts on the dishes lined up on the table. They talked about how this seasoning isn't found in Rezel, or what this ingredient might be—seems like they get along well.

<b>

Just when it seemed everything was settling down, Noah raised her hand and said, "Can I say something?"

<b>

"Because it's a hassle—or rather, it seems like it would be redundant to say this... but Jill just wants to see big brother fight seriously, not to see me and big brother fight, right?"

<b>

"Well, the second strongest after SR is Noah, right? What? Is there really that much of a gap between you two?"

<b>

...Huh? It feels like the conversation has looped back again.

Didn't Jill give up on seeing me fight seriously?

<b>

"There is. I think it would be quicker to see it in action... let's see... you guys lost to the Thunderbolt Track, right?"

<b>

"Yeah. It's frustrating, but it was a complete defeat."

<b>

"I can win against the Thunderbolt Track by myself. If you think I'm lying, just ask Shin and the others."

<b>

At Noah's words, the siblings' eyes widened in unison.

It feels like Noah's words are becoming more dismissive. Maybe she's getting tired of it.

<b>

"That means it's three against one, right!? That's impossible!"

<b>

"Are you saying that SR is stronger than Noah-sama!?"

<b>

The two exclaimed in surprise, speaking rapidly, and Noah looked at them with pity.

Honestly, I feel embarrassed being praised so much, but seeing their astonishment at the three against one situation makes me want to smile wryly.

I already know what Noah is going to say next.

<b>

"Listen, big brother is facing three from the Thunderbolt Track, plus the four from ASR, including me—seven people at once, and he's still holding back, okay? So please, just give up and compromise."

<b>

With a sigh, Noah's words left me a bit overwhelmed, and I couldn't interject. Arnold and the others were frozen in shock, and Sera, who had somehow ended up resting her head on my knee, groaned, "Nnnuu."

<b>

<b>

Ah... I just want to forget everything and sleep.
