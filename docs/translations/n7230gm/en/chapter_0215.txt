# A-98 Baptism?

In the previous chapter, I mentioned that the S-rank boss of Rezell is the Nine-Tails, but it was actually a mistake regarding the Storm Dragon. I apologize for that (o*。_。)oペコッ

The Crescent, Jade, and Vinzet siblings are set to go to the S-rank dungeon.

In other words, my mission is――none!! What am I supposed to do?

Originally, the number of people who came here exceeded the dungeon's limit of five, so I knew we would either split into two groups or someone would stay behind.

<b>

Since it’s unlikely that we will return from Rezell anytime soon, I’ll just let Crescent and the others take the credit for now, and I’ll go before I head back. It’s unthinkable to come this far and do nothing.

So, the question is what the leftover trio will do――

<b>

"Guiding explorers at the guild――is that so…"

<b>

As part of the conversation, Lady Katariya suggested, "If you have time, why not go to the guild? You can guide them while you're at it," and since I had nothing else to do, I had no choice but to agree. So, it ended up being me, Noah, and Sera going to the guild. By the way, Fenon and Shiri are apparently going to explore the royal capital with Lady Katariya.

<b>

In another room, the Vinzet siblings and Crescent are already having a meeting to strategize for the S-rank dungeon. I wonder if there’s even anything to discuss... It’s probably just Crescent and Jade beating everyone up. They might be going over some precautions or something.

As long as they’re together, there shouldn’t be any unforeseen issues.

<b>

So, for now, let’s worry about ourselves rather than them.

It’s a bit presumptuous for explorers from another country to come to the guild and offer guidance.

Previously, I showcased my strength in the Lindell arena, but only a very small number of people witnessed it. Only about ten people from each country saw my fight.

<b>

Some might know that I hold a title and that I soloed the S-rank dungeon, but that’s probably just hearsay, and I believe many won’t believe it until they see it for themselves.

Honestly, I have no idea how they will react.

<b>

"I’m looking forward to it. I wonder what the level of explorers in this country is like."

<b>

Sera said that, her eyes sparkling with excitement. She might be a bit similar to me in that she loves my fights.

The next morning.

Lady Katariya suggested, "Shall I have a knight guide you?" but I politely declined. I can’t relax that way, and I have a rough idea of where the guild is from wandering around the city yesterday.

We left the royal castle just before noon and walked through the city, flanked by Noah and Sera――we arrived at the explorer's guild.

<b>

As I opened the wooden folding doors and stepped inside,

<b>

"Mm? Is this your first time in the royal capital? It must be, right? You look like you’ve never seen it before."

<b>

A man in his thirties, who was drinking at the tavern attached to the guild, walked over and addressed the three of us.

He had dull green hair and a somewhat rugged face. He was slim but appeared to be well-muscled.

And it seemed he was quite drunk, as his face was flushed red.

<b>

"Yes, I just arrived from Lindell yesterday."

<b>

"Oh, really? You came all the way from Lindell, huh…"

<b>

He said that and began to scrutinize me from head to toe. I thought about warning him if he started looking at the two next to me, but he kept his gaze solely on me, so I just managed a wry smile.

After staring at me for about ten seconds, he turned around and called out,

<b>

"Hey, you guys! The explorer from Lindell says, 'You all look weak for explorers!' Let’s teach them a lesson!"

<b>

He started calling out to the other explorers who were chatting at the table.

<b>

"Huh? What do you mean, huh!? What are you talking about!?"

<b>

The drunk man ignored my words and kept calling out to the explorers, saying things like, "Let’s go to the training ground." What the hell is this guy doing?

I was bewildered by the sudden commotion, but for some reason, the receptionists didn’t intervene. Even if I had genuinely started a fight, or even if I hadn’t, shouldn’t the guild step in?

<b>

"I think we should ignore these idiots and talk to the guild master. We’ll report this matter to the guild master and Lady Katariya properly."

<b>

Sera said that while looking at the raucous men with an exasperated expression.

And as for Noah,

<b>

"Well, it might be fine, right? It looks interesting."

<b>

She grinned and expressed her agreement.

No matter how many people they come at me with, I won’t lose, but I think it’s a bad impression overall.

<b>

"Seriously, no one is going to stop this… What the hell is going on with the guild in Rezell?"

<b>

I muttered while looking at the completely empty guild. Even the receptionist, who had some free time, had joined the other explorers heading to the training ground.

<b>

"It’s going to be interesting, so let’s go."

<b>

Saying that, Noah took my hand and started walking toward the training ground.

<b>

"In terms of teaching them a lesson, it might be good. They probably don’t realize who will be the one taught a lesson."

<b>

My partner, who muttered something ominous, wore a frightening smile.
