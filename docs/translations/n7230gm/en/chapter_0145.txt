# A-31 The Upcoming Story

<b>

<b>

<b>

Since it was just around lunchtime, we decided to introduce ourselves while having a light meal.

Even though the other person was someone close, the roles were that of a master and a servant. The members of Thunderbolt and ASR sat at the long table in the dining room, chewing their food while listening to their upright conversation. The egg sandwich is delicious.

<b>

There wasn't anything particularly noteworthy, but if I had to say something, it was amusing to see Shin grinning when Ray, Sera's brother, bowed his head.

I had heard that Shin was close with Ray, so perhaps he was thinking of teasing his friend's work performance.

<b>

Let's change the subject.

<b>

After that, we decided to have Shion, who is both Shiri's father and our butler, guide us through the building.

<b>

Since it was in the royal capital, we had to give up on the idea of an outdoor hot spring, but the building was quite impressive with three stories and a spacious basement. This basement is planned to be used for training, but since I don't have any particular preferences, I hope it can be used for multiple purposes.

<b>

Hmm... Considering there are eight of us sharing a room, plus the servants' rooms, I thought it might be "unexpectedly cramped," but it seems like there won't be any issues at first glance. They probably adjusted by moving storage items to the basement.

<b>

Thinking about starting a new life is exciting, but I also need to make sure to solve any problems properly.

<b>

"Do we not need to look anymore? I thought Esuar was looking forward to the new home."

<b>

As soon as I sat down on the living room sofa, Suzu said that while sitting across from me.

<b>

"Shion showed us around, so we can take our time looking at the rest once we settle down. It seems like Sera and Shiri are too busy for that right now."

<b>

"Haha, they were surprised, weren't they?"

<b>

"I was surprised too! I saw Shiri's parents for the first time!"

<b>

I didn't even know she had an older sister, nor that her parents were a maid and a butler!

In response to my words, Shin laughed without a hint of remorse, saying, "My bad, my bad."

<b>

"---Don't you want to go talk to Ray and the others?"

<b>

Currently, Ray and Sera were in a separate room, and in another room, Phenon and Shiri were talking to the Shiri family. I don't know what kind of conversation they were having, but they're probably complaining about "not hearing anything." Well, they didn't seem to be opposed to becoming servants, so I shouldn't worry too much.

<b>

"Yeah. I talked enough with Ray when this was decided."

<b>

"That makes sense."

<b>

I replied shortly and crossed my arms.

It was such a sudden situation that I wasn't even sure what I should be thinking about or what I should be worried about, but I decided to try to focus my mind.

<b>

Just as I thought that and closed my eyes, Noah, who was sitting on the adjacent sofa, spoke up.

<b>

"I checked everything since it's the first time. Everyone is fine."

<b>

When I opened my eyes at those words, I saw the members of Thunderbolt letting out a sigh of relief.

What Noah meant was that she had read the thoughts of the servants using mind-reading.

<b>

"Considering who the members are, I wasn't too worried about that... but being overly cautious is just right. Thanks, I appreciate it."

<b>

When I thanked Noah, she smiled shyly and replied, "You're welcome." Then she directed her gaze forward—toward the members of Thunderbolt.

<b>

"---By the way, how's the rumor about us in the royal capital? I thought news about conquering the A-rank dungeon would be circulating."

<b>

In response to that question, Laika and Suzu replied.

<b>

"Of course, it's a topic of conversation not just among explorers. However, since it was ASR that conquered it, people aren't too surprised. It feels like they thought, 'I knew they would do it someday.'"

<b>

"With Sera, who has a title, it's mainly her that people are talking about, followed by Phenon, and then Noah."

<b>

Oh... it seems that Shin and the others were somewhat concerned about us.

In addition to them, Shin also shared information he had obtained, but the only thing related to me was jealousy about being surrounded by four women. Even though I'm hiding my abilities, it's a bit sad.

<b>

"Okay, okay. I got the gist of the situation in the royal capital. So, it seems that conquering an A-rank dungeon isn't causing much of a stir anymore?"

<b>

"Yeah. After all, everyone is in the midst of growth. They're not stuck at level 80 like before, so they probably think they can do it themselves."

<b>

Hmm... that might be a bit risky without status bonuses, but explaining this information to them seems unnecessary...

I've heard that there are departments in the royal capital researching status increases, and with job changes becoming more common, I think it's only a matter of time before they realize it.

<b>

"Why do you look so serious? Esuar should prefer to stay low-key, right?"

<b>

"Huh? Ah, well, about that—"

<b>

Speaking of which, I hadn't mentioned to the members of Thunderbolt that I was trying to achieve a significant accomplishment.

<b>

To avoid dragging things out too much, I summarized the key points and talked about my marriage with Sera and Phenon. And that I needed a significant accomplishment for that.

<b>

By the time I finished explaining, the members of Thunderbolt looked like they had found a new toy—wearing wonderful and mischievous smiles.

<b>

"Hehe. You've finally gotten serious about it. Sera and the others will be happy."

<b>

"Now we can fully lift Esuar up! I mean, it's been frustrating to be called 'the strongest in the world' when there are people above us!"

<b>

"Shin is bad at keeping secrets. It's better to reveal them sooner rather than later."

<b>

What the heck! Shin said, but his expression was bright.

<b>

"I feel bad for making you wait because of my selfishness. For now, I plan to conquer a nearby S-rank dungeon solo, but if that doesn't get me recognized, I'll have to think of my next move."

<b>

If there were an international martial arts tournament again, that would be a quick way, but those don't happen very often.

<b>

"Seriously... you make it sound easy. It probably is, but still."

<b>

"I think solo conquering an S-rank dungeon is more than enough of an accomplishment."

<b>

As Suzu said, I also think this is sufficient.

One concern I have is that battles inside dungeons don't come to anyone's attention.

No matter how much I insist that I went solo, if someone says, "You must have brought someone else," I have no way to prove it. The license records the conquest history, but it doesn't state how many people cleared it.

<b>

"If it comes down to it, I might have to ask the king to create an opportunity for me to fight against Shin and the others again... or maybe I could call the Vinzett siblings."

<b>

As I muttered that without directing it to anyone, Shin and the others all had strained smiles on their faces.
