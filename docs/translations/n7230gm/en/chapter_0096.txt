# 93 Determination

It can be in manga, novels, movies, or dramas.

There are scenes where the protagonist confesses or is confessed to just before the end of the world. Even if it's not the end of the world, confessions right before death are also common developments.

<b>

Right now, I find myself in a situation that I could never experience in my daily life, but somehow I seem to be different from the people on the screen or those printed on paper.

While exuding a hard-boiled atmosphere, there's no way I could say something like "I love you too."

<b>

"F-For now, time is running out, so we need to go to the fourth layer..."

<b>

I touched the window to move forward, despite my suspicious behavior.

<b>

I'm embarrassed.

<b>

I'm unavoidably happy, and I'm embarrassed.

I can easily imagine without looking in a mirror. My face must be bright red right now.

I never expected the drawbacks of not having a popular life to manifest in a place like this.

<b>

Of course, even I, who have walked the path of being unpopular, have sad feelings. I have to part with someone I could be in love with, so it can't be easy.

<b>

If it weren't for this situation and it were more normal—like when Phenon said "I love you"—how happy would I have been if there were no worries? At that time, I might have danced around without caring about my surroundings. There's even a possibility I would have shouted "Yes!"

<b>

We were enveloped in light, and the transfer began.

I wanted to know what kind of expression Sera was making, but I could only look down at my feet, turning my back on her.

<b>

Even after moving to the fourth layer, I took the lead in the battles, while Sera took on the role of keeping watch behind me. In other words, I wouldn't have to see her face for a while.

Eventually, I would somehow cool down the heat in my face.

<b>

My attempt was successful. Thanks to dungeon exploration, which has become a part of my life, I managed to regain my composure.

However, as my embarrassment subsided, the intensity of my sadness gradually increased.

<b>

"…Really, I wonder how it came to this."

<b>

I muttered while cutting down monsters. Of course, it wasn't loud enough for Sera behind me to hear.

<b>

Parting with Sera would come with conquering this S-rank dungeon.

My actions to clear the dungeon felt like tightening a noose around my own neck, but time seemed limited, and for the sake of bringing Phenon and the others back to this world, this was necessary.

<b>

I let out a deep sigh.

<b>

The monsters of the S-rank dungeon, which I was used to defeating, would react on their own as long as I could see them, so whether I was lost in thought or not, it wouldn't affect the hunt. There was even a bit of enjoyment like when playing a game.

<b>

"I'm sorry for suddenly saying something like that."

<b>

A lonely voice called out to my back as I searched for monsters.

<b>

"No, I was happy. Thank you."

<b>

I replied without looking at her.

I was embarrassed, and there was an awkward feeling, and somehow—if I looked at Sera now, I might hesitate to defeat the boss of the S-rank dungeon. So, I consciously fixed my gaze ahead.

<b>

"…I see, then I'm glad. In the next world, I want to hear your feelings, Esuar."

<b>

Not saying "Tell me now" was probably her consideration for me.

Even though in the next world, I would lose my memories and not be myself… what a kind person she is.

<b>

"Yeah, next time it will be from me..."

<b>

"Yes. I'll be waiting."

<b>

With a slightly brighter tone, Sera replied.

Honestly, I didn't want to convey my feelings to Sera in the current situation, so her offer was a relief.

<b>

After all, I have two rings in my inventory.

One is for Sera, and the other is for someone equally important to her.

<b>

If I could become mutually in love with them again in the new world, I would give it to them then.

This is because I couldn't just enjoy happiness for ourselves, leaving Phenon behind—and because I didn't want to make this broken world the endpoint. I couldn't feel happiness now to not give up on true happiness.

<b>

<b>

We safely traversed the fourth and fifth layers.

As always, I was the only one fighting monsters, but I had no scratches and plenty of stamina left. I was in a state where I could defeat the boss without any issues.

<b>

A brief moment of rest before challenging the boss.

The countdown timer displayed on the window indicated the last time I could talk slowly with her.

<b>

"Is it okay to fight the boss together?"

<b>

After taking a sip of water, Sera said.

It seemed like her usual tone, but it still felt somewhat stiff. Perhaps it was due to the fear of disappearing soon.

<b>

"That's fine, but… the boss is pretty strong, you know? If you're concerned about my feelings, I'm already prepared, so don't worry."

<b>

I still couldn't look straight into her eyes, but I replied, trying to act normally.

<b>

Just like the vanished Thunder's traces, they had come to the dungeon with me to avoid putting a mental burden on me. To not place the role of ending the world on me.

So I think she wants to defeat the boss together.

<b>

"Well, I'm not just tagging along. I've been closely watching your movements, so I think I can manage to do reasonably well."

<b>

"Ah… that's true, Sera picks things up really quickly."

<b>

It's at a level that makes me want to call it cheating.

As I thought about supporting her if things got dangerous, she continued, "And you know,"

<b>

"This battle is one of the memories I want to create with Esuar. I might forget it, but please tell the me in the next world. We defeated the boss of the S-rank dungeon together—no matter who delivers the final blow, let's agree to have no hard feelings."

<b>

"If Sera is okay with that, then I don't mind."

<b>

"Then let's do that. It's settled."

<b>

Sera nodded with a happy smile.

Talking like this normally made me think that maybe nothing would happen even after conquering the S-rank dungeon.

Maybe it was all a dream, and Phenon and the traces of Thunder would pop back up.

<b>

Well, reality isn't that sweet.

<b>

Indeed, Phenon and the others have disappeared, and Sera will also disappear soon, leaving me all alone in this world.

<b>

And even if I succeed in defeating Venom, no one will remember me.

<b>

Even so, I will accomplish it.

I will defeat Venom and return the world to its rightful form.

<b>

<b>

If I can see their smiles once more, it will be worth it. Even if it wasn't directed at me.
