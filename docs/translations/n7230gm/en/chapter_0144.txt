# A-30 The Servants

<b>

<b>

<b>

The conversation with Their Majesties ended with a warning to "not act recklessly."

That was probably—rather certainly—a message directed at me, who must achieve significant results from now on, but there is also a possibility that it was meant for Phenon.

After all, this child had said the other day, "If it comes to that, I'll flee the country." Her father, His Majesty, likely knows her character well.

<b>

After leaving the royal castle, we headed straight to our destination without any detours. The destination, needless to say, was our new home.

<b>

Yes—our new home!

<b>

While I am excited about having a new place to live, meeting the servants is still nerve-wracking. I can only hope they are good people.

<b>

"It seems like Phenon and Shiri might recognize some faces. They might have recruited people who worked at the royal castle."

<b>

As I said this while clasping my hands behind my head and walking, Phenon nodded and replied, "That's true."

<b>

"They probably sent experienced maids and elite knights from the order. I haven't been informed in detail, so I'm looking forward to it."

<b>

She said this while peering into my face with a smile. I almost reached out to pat her head, but I remembered that we were in the middle of town and managed to hold back.

That was close... I almost patted her head without thinking.

<b>

"Hmm... For now, I think we'll have to rely on Noah, but are you okay with that?"

<b>

Sera said this with a thoughtful expression. She was likely referring to the assessment of dangerous individuals.

Whether they are bad people or likely to spill secrets—if Noah can read minds, he should be able to understand immediately.

<b>

"Of course, Sera. I also get uneasy when there are strange people nearby. I feel bad for the servants, but I'll have to check on them regularly."

<b>

"Oh... You actually feel guilty about reading minds... I'm a little moved, big brother."

<b>

"Hey? You're kind of making fun of me, aren't you? You're definitely making fun of me, right!?"

<b>

"HAHAHAHA"

<b>

I tried to laugh in a foreign manner to deflect.

Then, without missing a beat, Noah elbowed me in the side. It wasn't just a poke—it was a jab. That hurt!?

<b>

In this way, we walked through the town with a cheerful atmosphere.

The townspeople, who shouldn't have been able to hear our conversation, were chuckling as they watched us.

<b>

And finally, we arrived at our new base.

<b>

Since we had been at the royal castle in the morning, it was just around lunchtime. However, I wanted to finish the handover of the new home first before filling my stomach. In fact, I wanted to enjoy a leisurely meal in our new house.

<b>

After thoroughly examining the exterior, we spoke with the construction workers waiting in front of the house and then confidently headed towards the entrance of the building.

I was idly wondering if the servants would prepare our meal—when a shock hit us that made me forget all about being hungry.

<b>

<b>

"Wh-what, big sister!? And why are Dad and Mom here!?"

<b>

When Shiri saw the servants waiting in the entrance hall, her expression turned to one of shock. Her tone was slightly different from usual, sounding more childish. In front of her were two women, one in her late twenties wearing a maid outfit and another who looked a bit older.

<b>

"W-well, this is unexpected..."

<b>

I couldn't help but let those words slip out.

Considering what Shiri had said, these two should be mother and daughter, and there should be a significant age gap, but they didn't look it at all. Isn't Mom too young?

The maids were desperately trying to suppress their laughter at Shiri's reaction. They looked like they were about to pull out a "Surprise! It was a prank!" sign at any moment.

<b>

"Shiri, your voice is too loud."

<b>

The one gently admonishing her was a man in a butler's outfit, looking to be in his thirties. Considering Shiri's age, this butler should be at least over forty... It's strange how this world works.

Shiri's slightly droopy eyes must have been inherited from this man—though his eyes were narrow like slits, there was a resemblance.

<b>

As I pondered this as if it were someone else's business, I noticed a similar commotion happening elsewhere.

<b>

"Rei, big brother!? Why are you here!?"

<b>

Sera's voice rose as she looked at her older brother, Rei Bernot, clad in armor. I hadn't seen him since the martial arts tournament before the world collapsed, but my memory isn't too shabby.

<b>

"Why do you ask? I was assigned to guard this house. The people behind me are my subordinates—"

<b>

"That doesn't matter! Well, it does, but—ah! I'm sorry! Please don't make such a sad expression! I didn't mean to disregard you—"

<b>

Waving her hands around, Sera desperately tried to explain herself to Rei's subordinates. What is she doing?

<b>

Still, though.

<b>

"I can't believe how much family you've brought together..."

<b>

As bystanders, the three of us—me, Phenon, and Noah—stepped back a little to watch the unfolding situation.

The butler was sending glances at Phenon as if he wanted to say something, but she seemed to convey with gestures that it was "fine."

<b>

"With this, we shouldn't have to worry about betrayal. Shiri's family worked at the royal castle, so I know them."

<b>

"I see... It feels less like hiring servants and more like welcoming family and bringing friends along."

<b>

Shiri's mother was casting a scrutinizing gaze at me, but should I pretend not to notice...? By the way, the older sister was oddly licking her lips while looking at me. Please don't eat me.

<b>

<b>

The latecomers, the Thunderbolt crew, seemed to already know about the servants and were laughing heartily at our reactions.

<b>

As a result, Shin's training became even stricter, and he ended up whining about it—but that's another story.
