# A-108 Housewarming Celebration

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Since Crescent and Jade's new home has been completed, a housewarming party will be held at their house. The participants will include members of ASR, the three from Thunder's Trail, and the servants working at our home—a casual gathering with just family.

<b>

Preparations are steadily underway in the garden of their house, with several round tables covered in white tablecloths set up, and a beautiful vase displayed at the center.

<b>

There are benches a little way off, but it seems that the format will primarily be a standing buffet.

<b>

In any case, a few tables have chairs prepared, so it seems possible to eat there as well. It feels like everyone can choose what they prefer.

<b>

Rather than a showcase of their new home, it seems more focused on deepening friendships. Both Crescent and Jade have started to open up to the people of this world, but it's still true that it hasn't been long.

<b>

Once light snacks are laid out on the tables and drinks are distributed to everyone, the two hosts step up onto a wooden platform hastily prepared.

<b>

They seem a bit nervous. I would hate to be in their position. It's fine to be watched while fighting, but this kind of attention is tough.

<b>

"Uh, everyone, thank you for gathering here today."

<b>

As Crescent awkwardly says this, Shin shouts, "You're too stiff!" Immediately, two of the women from Thunder kick and punch Shin. That looks painful.

<b>

Well, at least everyone is laughing and enjoying the light atmosphere. I can understand Shin's urge to say "too stiff." They can relax more. It's just a dinner party with family.

<b>

"Well, I can't help it! I'm not used to this kind of thing! —Hey, Hime-chan, you should say something too!"

<b>

"Uh... I'm not good at this either."

<b>

"I'm not good at it either! —Ah, ugh, let's just toast! Cheers!"

<b>

Everyone laughs at their exchange, and the party begins.

<b>

<b>

<b>

It seemed like everyone was enjoying their meals while moving around freely, so I decided to wander around the garden and talk to everyone.

First, I noticed Shin was alone, so I headed over to him.

<b>

"You're not with Laika and Suzu, huh?"

<b>

"We're together all the time. They're over there with Fenon."

<b>

Looking in the direction Shin indicated, I saw Fenon, Laika, Suzu, and Shiri gathered around a table. Shiri was standing behind Fenon, while the other three were seated.

<b>

"They say they want to learn from Fenon's grace. I don't think that's necessary for explorers, though."

<b>

"Well, there are individual differences in that..."

<b>

In fact, I feel like Fenon has become less graceful since she started hanging out with us... No, of course, it's not that she lacks the dignity of a first princess; rather, she's changed for the better. That's important.

<b>

"Fenon is beautiful, and I understand the admiration. While the delicate Fenon was nice, I think I prefer the energetic and vibrant Fenon now."

<b>

I recall when Fenon referred to me as "Hero."

Since that time when she worried about my life more than her own, I've gradually been drawn to her.

<b>

While watching the three of them happily chatting from a distance, I spoke to Shin, who then put his hand around my shoulder, saying, "Oh?"

<b>

"Bragging about your wife, huh? It's impressive you can say that while sober."

<b>

As Shin clinks his glass of wine against the fruit juice in my hand, I respond, "Shin, what about you? Are you planning to remain single?"

<b>

"…Who knows."

<b>

He says this with difficulty, then releases my shoulder and takes a sip of wine.

<b>

Oh? I thought Shin would bluntly say something like "I'm not interested in that kind of thing right now," but he seems to be evasive? Could it be?

<b>

"Which is it? Laika? Suzu? Or someone else?"

<b>

I'm curious. Maybe one of them has approached him?

<b>

"Hey, I haven't said anything."

<b>

"I see, so it's both."

<b>

"I told you I haven't said anything!?"

<b>

Whether it's the alcohol or something else, Shin's face turns red as he shouts. But his voice is low. He must be trying not to be overheard... It's making me grin.

<b>

How he interprets my lewd smile, he sighs and gives me a glare.

<b>

"…We've known each other since we were kids. We're not in a relationship where we start talking about love now."

<b>

"—Are you just trying to convince yourself? What about those two?"

<b>

"…Who knows."

<b>

The fact that he doesn't deny it probably means that neither of them is entirely uninterested.

<b>

If only Noah could read his thoughts, it might help, but that would definitely be against the rules. I could end up in a tight spot. I don't want to take those kicks and punches.

<b>

I think I'll try to probe those two a bit.
