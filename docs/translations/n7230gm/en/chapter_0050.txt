# 48 Ring

<b>

<b>

<b>

Returning home to the duke's residence after finishing the dungeon exploration.

<b>

Since Lord Drag and the others had dinner earlier due to our late return, we had dinner only with the party members.

Sometimes Lord Drag makes an appearance, but it's usually about once every three days. I wish he would just sleep in and not worry about coming to greet us.

<b>

Normally, after this, we would take separate baths by gender and head to our assigned bedrooms, but today is a bit different.

I stopped the party members who were heading to the bath and guided them to the bedroom.

<b>

<b>

Three days left until the martial arts tournament.

<b>

I think they must be tired from the consecutive dungeon explorations, but there was something I absolutely wanted to discuss with them.

<b>

"I know you all want to sleep early, but please give me just a little bit of your time; I'll keep it brief."

<b>

After seating the three of them on the sofa, I sat down on the bed.

As expected from a duke's household, even though it's a private room, its size is quite impressive. It must be over 20 tatami mats.

<b>

It would have been easier to talk if the two sofas were facing each other, but... well, I should be grateful that there is such a large sofa in the bedroom.

<b>

"Please don't worry about us. The one who is most tired here is Lord Esuar."

<b>

"That's right. Please don't overdo it."

<b>

Following Fenon, Shiri also expressed concern for my health. The warmth of their kindness, which I couldn't have imagined in my old company, almost made me tear up.

<b>

On the other hand, there was Sera.

She leaned in closer to me, narrowing her eyes as if observing my face.

<b>

"...You don't have dark circles, and your complexion doesn't seem bad."

<b>

It seems she was also concerned about my health.

We had just shared a meal together, so she should have been able to tell without staring at me. She's still a bit clueless outside of combat.

<b>

"There's no way I'd have dark circles from this."

<b>

Every day is filled with enjoyable level-ups, and I'm getting plenty of sleep.

The days of meetings before the announcement of the secondary derived classes were much tougher.

<b>

"That's good to hear. I still dream about my master's face from that time."

<b>

Shrugging her shoulders, Sera said that.

She was probably referring to the day we first met Shin. Even Shin, who must have had doubts about me back then, was worried about me.

<b>

Seeing Fenon's apologetic expression, I decided to quickly get to the point.

<b>

"Today, I want to talk about this."

<b>

I took the item from my inventory and placed it in the palm of my hand. Then I extended my arm so everyone could see it.

<b>

"This is... a ring?"

<b>

"It has a simple appearance."

<b>

Fenon and Shiri each expressed their thoughts.

As Shiri said, this ring isn't particularly distinctive.

It's just an ordinary silver ring with a gem smaller than a grain of rice embedded in it.

The gem sparkles with a color reminiscent of emerald or jade.

<b>

I tossed the ring towards Sera, who had a puzzled expression.

<b>

"---What!? Wha-what!?"

<b>

Flailing her hands, Sera managed to catch the ring in mid-air.

After giving me a briefly dissatisfied look, she pinched the ring between her index finger and thumb and began to observe it from various angles.

<b>

"? What about this ring? The gem is indeed beautiful, but it's not large, and the ring itself is ordinary."

<b>

It's true that you wouldn't be able to tell just by looking at it. But it's a good item.

<b>

"This is the ring that the boss dropped during the second dungeon exploration today."

<b>

"!? So this is the drop item my master was looking for!?"

<b>

"Yeah. I was lucky."

<b>

Yes.

<b>

This ring is the one I had been wanting, with a drop rate of only 1 percent.

There are six types of rings. Each can be obtained with a 1 percent chance, making the overall chance of acquiring any ring 6 percent. Even so, collecting all types is still quite challenging.

<b>

I had already informed my party members that I had "a desired drop item," so they all rejoiced at my report.

However, I hadn't yet conveyed what was so amazing about this ring, so it felt like they were simply celebrating the fulfillment of my wish.

<b>

It's late at night, and there's no time to hold back.

<b>

"This ring is called the 'Ring of Dexterity.' It has a straightforward name, but its effect is tremendous. Just wearing that ring will increase your DEX by one level."

<b>

"...One level means---could it be that it surpasses the wall?"

<b>

Sera asked cautiously.

<b>

It seems that people in this world refer to the increase in stats that occurs every ten levels as "surpassing the wall." Although it's still in the early stages of research, it appears that there are departments within the Explorer Guild that study which stats are easier to increase for each profession.

<b>

If I were to explain everything, it might lead to a big problem.

<b>

"To put it in your terms, that's right. I mentioned that stats are indicated in letters like in a dungeon, right? That means it goes up by one level."

<b>

So if it's D, it goes to C. If it's C, it goes to B.

I had used this item during the battle against the Overlord Venom, and it's an incredibly useful item that can be used until the endgame. If I can obtain this precious item in a B-rank dungeon, there's no reason not to go for it.

<b>

"...That's quite an extraordinary item. Lord Esuar, is there a limit to the number of these rings?"

<b>

"Of course, there is a limit, Fenon. You can only gain the effect from wearing one ring. Any additional ones are just for show."

<b>

"I see... But even one is more than enough in terms of effect."

<b>

"That's true. Once again, my master has done something incredible..."

<b>

"Hey, wait! Don't make it sound like I'm doing something bad! I'm not giving you the ring!"

<b>

"What? Was this ring a present for me?"

<b>

Sera said teasingly.

<b>

"A present---well, that ring is a drop item, so it's for the entire party."

<b>

Currently, all drop items are collected in my inventory as the leader, but this is shared property of the party. I've made sure to have Shiri properly record what we've obtained.

<b>

"...But I personally want Sera to use it. Fenon and Shiri, is it alright if I make this decision on my own? Of course, I'll give you both one as soon as I can get them."

<b>

At my words, Fenon smiled and said, "I'll leave it to you, Lord Esuar," while Shiri shook her head vigorously, looking flustered.

<b>

"---So that's how it is. The martial arts tournament is coming up, so get used to fighting while wearing that."

<b>

As I said this, she stared intently at the ring with a serious expression.

Just a moment ago, she was joking about whether it was a "present," but now that it's truly being given to her, it seemed she was grappling with some inner conflict.

<b>

After staring at the ring for nearly a minute, Sera slowly shook her head.

<b>

"I have been given knowledge by my master, leveled up by my master, and received technical guidance from my master. Even if I become stronger with a ring like this, can I truly call that my strength? Is it right to say that this strength is 'skill'?"

<b>

Looking down, she spoke in a wilted voice.

<b>

Just hearing her voice conveyed the anxiety she felt within. It wasn't just me who sensed it; Fenon and Shiri likely felt it too. As evidence, they were looking at her with troubled expressions.

<b>

I sighed and stood up from the bed, walking over to the sofa.

Sera looked up at me with a puzzled expression.

<b>

Really... What are you worried about? 

To me, it seems ridiculous that the inhabitants of this world would have such worries, considering my life on Earth.

<b>

I swiftly brought my hand down in a knife-hand strike onto her forehead.

<b>

"---Ngh!? Wh-what are you doing!?"

<b>

Sera pressed both hands to her forehead, her eyes welling up with tears.

Oh no... I might have been a bit too strong; it's hard to gauge.

<b>

Deciding that worrying about the past is pointless, I spoke to her.

<b>

"There is no such thing as borrowed strength. The same goes for knowledge and items."

<b>

In a world with a level system, power and skills are already given by "someone," right? It's too late to question whether it's your own ability.

<b>

Besides, this "eye" of mine didn't exist in the real world.

<b>

In the real world, my eyesight wasn't particularly good, and my reaction time was just average.

If I had this "eye" in reality, I would probably have excelled in sports and wouldn't have been so absorbed in games. Though I'm not confident about that.

<b>

This "eye," which was my advantage only in the VR world, has now become a reality and is a part of my strength.

<b>

I don't want to think of this as thanks to someone else. Including this "eye," it is my ability.

<b>

"Whether it's knowledge or items, if you can use them properly, they become your own strength, Sera. Have confidence, hold your head high---the same goes for leveling up and guidance, you know? The reason I give advice is that I like hardworking Sera. It's not just anyone; you're special."

<b>

If I hadn't liked Shin and the others from the Thunder's Trail, I wouldn't have bothered to help them until they achieved their goals.

At the very least, I wouldn't just hand out elixirs casually.

It can also be said that gaining me as an ally is one of their strengths.

<b>

Sera, who had received the knife-hand strike, was not blushing on her forehead but for some reason, her ears were turning red.

Did I say something strange? Why is she blushing here? Was she embarrassed to be lectured by someone younger?

<b>

Ignoring my confusion, Sera spoke in broken sentences.

<b>

"Ah, um... well. Th-thank you... Lord Esuar."

<b>

"Wasn't I your master just now? Huh?"

<b>

"...That's right. Thank you, master."

<b>

While rubbing her forehead, Sera replied with a strangely happy expression. After that, she hugged the ring tightly as if it were precious.

<b>

Fenon was looking at us with a smile, as if watching something heartwarming.
