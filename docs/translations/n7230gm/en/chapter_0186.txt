# A-69 Return to the Homeland

<b>

<b>

After a long journey of five days, we returned to our homeland, Lindale.

Wow, it was incredibly long. I can't count how many times I wanted to jump out of the carriage and run.

The reason it felt longer than when we were heading to Palmour was probably because we were eagerly anticipating our completed new home. I was excited when we first built it, but this time the scale is even larger.

Well, it also felt long simply because it was the same scenery for the second time, so I got bored.

<b>

After arriving in the royal capital in the evening, the five of us went to greet the royal palace and check in at the guild, just to let everyone know we had returned safely. As we traveled through the city in the carriage, the townspeople began to stir, and the guards surrounding the carriage had a hard time managing the situation. Sorry about that.

Since it had been a while since we were in the royal capital, Fenon and Shiri went to the royal palace, and Sera returned to the count's house to spend their respective nights.

<b>

<b>

"Even though the excitement has somewhat cooled down, it's still unsettling to be in the spotlight."

<b>

As I lay on the bed in the party house we built in the royal capital, I muttered this, and Noah, who was lying on the bed next to me, chuckled softly.

Ray, Sera's brother, returned to the count's house with Sera, and Shiri's family also went to the royal palace.

Currently, there are only a few guards patrolling around the house, and just Noah and me.

<b>

"Of course. My brother is married to the first princess of this country, and it hasn't even been six months since that match in the arena, right? He's probably feared even more than the nobles now."

<b>

"In a game, it would just be 'that guy is amazing,' but here it turns into fear."

<b>

The atmosphere of fear is particularly evident among those related to explorers.

Well, it’s not to the point of being depressing, probably because the top figures like the Thunderous Trail and Regulus are friendly. Plus, I’ve always been a loner anyway.

<b>

"Well, we built our house in a place where we won't be exposed to those kinds of gazes. We should be able to relax at home, right?"

<b>

"I'm too excited about the house to focus, so please stop talking about the new home as much as possible."

<b>

Just when I was trying to push those thoughts out of my mind, they were dragged back in.

Damn... the design is about twice the size of the old house... just looking around will definitely be fun.

<b>

It seems that the Thunderous Trail is currently in Reinas, so if we meet up there, they will undoubtedly come to our house. Exploring together wouldn't be bad either.

I wonder if they're doing well... As I pondered this,

<b>

"Then why not just focus on me... ? *glance*"

<b>

Noah, with sound effects, lightly lifted the hem of her clothes.

From the gap in her clothes, I could see what looked like pink underwear... but wait, aren't you supposed to be around twelve years old? Are you trying to make me a lolicon?

<b>

"If you could make me obsessed with you, it would probably be only during a fight, right?"

<b>

I shifted my gaze from Noah to the ceiling and said with a mix of exasperation.

In this world, Noah has the second-highest level after me. And she should know the most about techniques. Whether she can use that knowledge in actual combat is another story.

<b>

"W-well, when you say 'fight'... I-I’m ready in my heart! I-I’m technically a god, right? I may not have combat experience, but I have knowledge!"

<b>

"…I’m telling you, it’s definitely not what you’re imagining right now, okay? It’s about combat!"

<b>

"Does that mean it's a night battle—"

<b>

"I'm saying it's not, you brat! You definitely know what you're saying!"

<b>

"Ah, I can’t wait for the new house!"

<b>

"Ah! I was just starting to forget about it!!"

<b>

In this way, I spent the night in Lindale, being toyed with by Noah after a long time.

The next day.

I went to pick up Sera with Noah and then headed to the royal palace.

There, we met up with Fenon and Shiri, exchanged a few words with the king, queen, and prince, and then we boarded the carriage to head to Reinas.

<b>

"I-I just want to confirm, but you two often stay together at night... is there nothing going on?"

<b>

Sera, sitting to my left, asked this while looking down.

No, no, if I made a move on Noah, that would be a whole different issue. I get teased about it, though.

<b>

"That's right~. My brother just doesn't make a move at all."

<b>

"Noah, even if you have your original position, you mustn't make a move on Esar before us, okay?"

<b>

Fenon said with an atmosphere that seemed to fit the sound effect of *gogogogogo...*. Her face was smiling, but it was scary. She's got some serious guts facing a former god.

<b>

"Haha, forget about my original position. Right now, I'm just my brother's little sister. So even if I make a move—"

<b>

"That makes it even worse, you idiot."

<b>

While retorting, I brought my hand down in a knife-hand strike toward Noah, who was sitting across from me.

It shouldn't have hurt much, but she held her head and shouted, "Ouch!"

Seriously, this girl has no dignity as a god.
