# 99 Level Up

<b>

<b>

<b>

It's just a daily routine of defeating monsters.

<b>

In this world, I am the only one left, continuously leveling up like a corporate slave. The time I've spent fighting alone here has already surpassed the time I spent with Sera and Fenon.

<b>

Thanks to Noah summoning monsters as I wish, my levels are rising significantly faster than I had anticipated, but leveling up to the third job still takes a considerable amount of time.

<b>

Even so, there are mainly three reasons why I have been able to diligently continue leveling up.

<b>

First. Even though it's my second time, leveling up is still fun.

<b>

Even in this situation, the life-and-death battles with monsters are truly enjoyable, and I absolutely love the feeling of gradually getting stronger. Moreover, unlike the real world, my efforts visibly translate into results.

<b>

And the second reason. My feelings for my comrades have grown even stronger since losing them.

<b>

I was worried that if I didn't see their faces for a long time, my feelings would fade, but in reality, it was the opposite. My feelings for them have intensified day by day.

If I succeed in defeating Venom and can meet them in the next world, I would either faint on the spot or cry uncontrollably without caring about my surroundings.

<b>

And the last reason.

To be honest, I don't want to admit it and have no intention of thanking them, but it might be thanks to that brat—though just a tiny bit.

<b>

Even though my goal is to retrieve Sera and the others, I am struggling to save this world, so I believe Noah should wholeheartedly support me.

<b>

However, even though she forced our interests to align, she has continued to support me, encouraging me with a cheerful voice despite my cold responses and sometimes being insulted.

She could have easily used the phrase of taking Sera and the others as hostages.

<b>

So I want to hate her from the bottom of my heart, but I can't. Unwillingly.

<b>

<b>

—So, I think you should act in a way that makes me hate you more.

<b>

"Just because you’re getting used to it, don’t try to have a conversation with your inner voice…"

<b>

As I closed my eyes and enjoyed the aroma of coffee wafting from the cup near my mouth, Noah spoke in a sulky tone.

After all, you can read my mind, so we can communicate this way, right? Got a problem with that? Huh?

<b>

"Why are you being so confrontational? And from an outsider's perspective, it looks like I'm talking to myself, which is strange, isn’t it?"

<b>

There's no one else in this world. Even if I were to dance naked, no one would reprimand me. Lucky you.

<b>

"I don't have that kind of hobby! …Are you perhaps interested in my naked body?"

<b>

—Ugh!

<b>

"Could you not spit in your mind!?"

<b>

Such exchanges have become a daily occurrence now.

As Noah said, from an outsider's perspective, her changing expressions while talking alone is abnormal, and if my voice were to come out loud, it would create the image of an adult man bullying a little girl.

Either way, it’s the worst.

<b>

"Alright, alright. Is this satisfactory? Young lady."

<b>

"Hey, are you actually a bully?"

<b>

That's not true. To me, Noah is a special existence.

<b>

"I think that phrase should be used in a different context! And besides, I didn’t say it out loud again!"

<b>

Noah shouted with gestures and expressions that perfectly suited the phrase "pouting!"

She often says, "Don’t treat me like a child," but I think she should look in the mirror before saying that. Or maybe she should record herself and watch it back. Let her suffer in shame all alone.

<b>

"By the way, what day is it today?"

<b>

I placed the coffee cup I was holding on the table and asked Noah. She puffed her cheeks and muttered, "You switch topics quickly," but still answered my question.

<b>

"It’s been 516 days since you cleared the S-rank dungeon."

<b>

"Wow… I guess it's fast when you only defeat the bosses."

<b>

"Your pace of defeating them is abnormal. I never thought you could grow this much in such a short time."

<b>

Noah's mention of growth means that I have leveled all my third jobs to level 90.

In other words, I have completed acquiring all player bonuses.

<b>

Now, I just need to acquire useful skills from the Demon King and the associated jobs, which shouldn’t take more than six months.

<b>

<b>

Those who have been playing Tempest for a long time—top players—have mostly acquired all player bonuses, but from the perspective of newcomers, players in that state are generally considered "abnormal."

<b>

Well, the time required for leveling up is considerable, and compared to the initial stats, the window showing the state of having acquired all player bonuses must look quite bizarre.

<b>

Even now, my stats, although supplemented by rings and the Black Coffin, have a minimum value of SS. The skills include "Gravity Magic," which the Demon King learns at level 50, along with lower-tier skills.

<b>

Once I acquire the skills, it’s just the final adjustments for the Venom battle.

Though, it mainly involves having Noah create the weapons I used in the past and checking their usability.

<b>

Once that’s done, it’s finally time for the decisive battle.

<b>

Can I reclaim Sera and the others—the world?

Or will I be defeated by Venom and have everything vanish?

From Noah's perspective, who knows both me and Venom, the outcome seems to be fifty-fifty.

<b>

<b>

While I feel nervous—there's also a part of me that thinks it’s exciting, which is probably just my nature.
