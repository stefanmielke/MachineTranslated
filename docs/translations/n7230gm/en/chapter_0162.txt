# Casual Talk at the Inn

<b>

<b>

<b>

After arriving in the capital of the Palmour Kingdom, we were guided by the knights of this country to a top-notch luxury inn.

It seemed that they had prepared one room for each person, but due to the wishes of the women, it was changed from five rooms to two.

I was thinking, "Are we going to separate by gender?" or "Maybe they are anxious because it's a foreign country," but everyone was expressing their opinions as if it were natural to share a room with me. I caught sight of the receptionist smiling wryly, so in the end, we decided to draw lots to determine the room assignments. There was initially a suggestion to have everyone in one room, but I firmly rejected that as it was too embarrassing.

<b>

"Ah... luxury inns are really nice."

<b>

I’m not sure if I should say "in my previous life," but I have never slept in such a luxurious bed on Earth. Recently, sinking into such a high-end bed has become commonplace for me, but I was originally a commoner. Sure, the comfort may not compare to the scientifically advanced beds of Earth, but the atmosphere makes it feel nice. Perhaps it's a placebo effect.

<b>

After finishing our meal and bath, we all talked for a while, reminiscing about our journey, and then the three in the other room said their goodnights and left.

After seeing them off, I lay face down and then on my back on the bed, and Noah, who was rolling around in the other bed like me, responded in a relaxed voice, "Yeah."

Yes, my roommate is Noah. The self-proclaimed bratty little sister of a former god. The other three are spending the night in a different room.

It’s a bit lonely not being able to share a room with my spouse at times like this, but it’s somewhat embarrassing, and perhaps it’s for the best. Yes, that’s right. I’m a coward.

<b>

"Yeah."

<b>

"Hey, the second 'yeah' is out of place timing-wise."

<b>

"It’s just your imagination, just your imagination~"

<b>

Noah said cheerfully as she sat up and tried to sit on the bed, but for some reason, she came over to my bed. Then, with a light sound, she plopped down on the bed.

<b>

"What’s up? Did you want to talk some more?"

<b>

I thought we had talked enough just a moment ago... Maybe gods surprisingly enjoy chatting. In her case, it might also be a reaction to having worked alone for so long.

In response to my question, she flapped her feet and then squinted her eyes while smiling.

<b>

"Hehe, it’s my first time going this far, so I’m having fun."

<b>

"For a god, the concept of travel probably doesn’t exist."

<b>

"Yeah. It was definitely the right choice to switch places with Lady Idea. I knew about human life as knowledge, and I thought there would be many inconveniences, but it’s really fun."

<b>

She said that with a smile, but suddenly she stopped flapping her feet and lowered her gaze to her feet.

<b>

"It’s fun... and because it’s fun, it’s lonely. Human lifespans are just a moment, you know."

<b>

"Well, compared to gods, it’s definitely just a moment."

<b>

Saying that, I glanced at Noah while lying down. I could only see her profile, but I could tell her expression was dark.

I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn’t think of the right words.

I thought that if I could say something uplifting or encouraging at times like this, I would be more popular, and I started to string words together as they came out.

<b>

"I think it’s precisely because it’s short, because it’s limited, that it’s enjoyable—at least for me."

<b>

I propped myself up on my elbows and supported my head with my hand as I spoke.

<b>

"I don’t know how to put it... but, well, because we both have limited time, I think we want to spend that time together and want to 'enjoy' it."

<b>

"Because... that’s something for big brother or people, right? I’m going to return to being a god later to manage the world—'Why not just quit?'—Huh?"

<b>

"So, just quit? Leave the rest to Lady Idea, and that god might manage it as is, or if it’s too much trouble, they might appoint a proxy, right?"

<b>

"That... might be true, but..."

<b>

She made a troubled face, furrowing her brows.

<b>

"I don’t understand the values of gods, and maybe I’ll think that finishing my life as a human is undesirable—but I think the best way for you to not feel lonely is probably to be buried in the same grave as us."

<b>

Somehow it came out sounding like "You’re coming with me!" but I hope she understands the nuance. I’m not good at choosing my words.

I was a bit anxious about what kind of reaction I would get, but for some reason, she was smiling.

<b>

"Hehe, asking to be buried in the same grave, that’s a proposal. Big brother, have you finally fallen for me?"

<b>

"W-What!? Seriously!? I didn’t know it had that meaning! That’s not what I meant! This is more like, let’s spend a lot of time together and be together until we die—ahhh! That’s not it! Forget what I just said!"

<b>

"Ahaha! Why are you so flustered? It’s rare to see big brother in a panic."

<b>

"Shut up! Listen! Forget it!"

<b>

When I said that, she replied, "Okay, okay," half-laughing, and then she fell back, her head landing right on my thigh, using it as a pillow. She’s light, so it’s not a problem.

<b>

After that, the words "thank you" that she muttered like a soliloquy, I wonder what they were for.
