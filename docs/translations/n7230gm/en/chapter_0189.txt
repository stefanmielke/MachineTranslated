# A-72 New Home's Bath

<b>

<b>

<b>

The trails of thunder left after looking around the house with us for a while, saying, "It's about time we take our leave." Even though it was just a brief look, it took quite a bit of time because the place was spacious.

<b>

It had been a few months since I last saw them, but I didn't feel particularly nostalgic.

<b>

Since they live nearby and are active as explorers, we would inevitably run into each other. They seem to be steadily leveling up, and if they continue to grow stronger, they should be able to clear not only A-rank but also S-rank dungeons with ease.

<b>

The Shiri family and Mr. Rei, along with the servants and guards, are scheduled to come to our house tomorrow morning. Today, it seems they are conducting handover work with the new people who will take care of the house at the party house in the royal capital.

<b>

The guards who came this far are apparently securing the area around the new house, so right now, the only ones inside this house are truly the ASR party members.

<b>

"Do Japanese people really like baths... or is it because they lived on Earth that they like baths... I wonder which it is."

<b>

After eating the dinner prepared by Sera and Shiri, it was bath time.

<b>

There is only one bath location, and even the bathtub is spacious enough for at least twenty people to soak comfortably. In fact, it might be bigger than the apartment I lived in on Earth.

<b>

Last time, the bathtub had a wooden appearance, but this time it was made of rugged stone. It was an indoor bath that allowed one to enjoy the feeling of an open-air bath. The windows were also large, providing a sense of openness.

<b>

"Ahhh... this feels nice..."

<b>

It felt as if the fatigue was dissolving into the water. Although I wasn't particularly tired.

<b>

"What are you going to do from now on? You're going to other countries to conquer S-rank dungeons, right?"

<b>

As I leaned back against the edge of the bathtub, I heard Noah's voice from next to me.

<b>

"Hmm, that's right. If we conquer everything, something might happen. Even if I end up fighting Venom again, this time I'll get through it without taking any damage."

<b>

"Oh! As expected of the Overlord! Declaring to beat up a wicked god is so cool!"

<b>

"Since it's not a new enemy, I’m not too worried. Either way, I’ll be taking it easy in Lindell for a while longer. There’s no need to rush—huh?"

<b>

...Wait a minute.

Why am I having a normal conversation with Noah?

We just agreed that I would go in first, right? It’s impossible for her to be here right now, right?

<b>

Thinking that, I cautiously turned my face to the side and saw Noah, looking comfortable with a towel over her eyes, her expression relaxed. Of course, she was completely naked.

I have no interest in a young girl's body, but if asked whether I could take a bath with her, it’s a delicate line.

<b>

"I-I was against this, you know!"

<b>

"Mr. SR, please try not to look over here too much."

<b>

"Um, if you’d like, I can wash your back..."

<b>

I could hear the voices of Sera, Phenon, and Shiri coming from behind me. The damp footsteps on the floor suggested they were barefoot.

<b>

Hey, hey, hey, hey. Did they all come to take a bath together!? You all suggested I go in first, didn’t you!? Why are you coming in!?

<b>

Sure, the bath is big enough for everyone, but! Since we’re newlyweds, it might be okay to bathe together, but please give me some time to prepare mentally!

<b>

"Because if I don’t do this, I feel like you’d get shy and refuse~"

<b>

"You read people's hearts too easily, you idiot."

<b>

"I can tell just by looking at your expression, so I’m not using mind-reading, okay?"

<b>

"Oh, is that so? My apologies! But it’s strange for you to be here, considering Sera and Phenon are married!"

<b>

"Huh? Did Shiri just casually say it’s not a problem? Besides, I’m technically in the position of a sister, so it’s fine, right?"

<b>

"That’s not how it works in reality!"

<b>

And let’s not get into the issue with Shiri!

<b>

While having a futile argument with Noah, I glanced sideways at the direction where Sera and the others should be, and they were all wrapped in bath towels.

<b>

The towels were tightly wrapped to show off their body lines, and without saying what, Shiri was impressive.

I was fully utilizing the keen eyesight I had developed over ten years.

<b>

"Are you really planning to take a bath? I mean, I’ve already washed my body."

<b>

However, as someone who hasn’t had much experience in such matters, I couldn’t possibly look directly in their direction.

<b>

I immediately turned to face the large window—but Sera and the others were clearly reflected in the glass, so I looked up at the ceiling.

<b>

"Then, big brother, are you going to wash my body? Ah, or maybe that’s impossible because you might get aroused?"

<b>

"Huh!? I don’t care about your lack of washability! But I won’t fall for that! Wash yourself!"

<b>

"Then what if I had a curvy body?"

<b>

"Why are you using such an outdated expression... I-I’m not interested in what happens to your body."

<b>

"Hmm? You hesitated for a moment just now, didn’t you?"

<b>

"I-I’m just imagining things!"

<b>

Imagining Noah as an adult woman turned out to be unexpectedly beautiful. How unfortunate.

I would never want to say it to her face, but she is good-looking.

<b>

"……If you read my mind now, I’ll be angry."

<b>

"Hahaha, it’s fine because I don’t even need to read it. You’re so shy."

<b>

I can't take this former god anymore.
