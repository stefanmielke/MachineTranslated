# A-106 S Rank Dungeon

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day after going out with Phenon and the others.

<b>

Since today is free, I have come to the S Rank Dungeon.

The party consists of just Noah and me. Hissui and the others went out to explore the town, while Sera, Phenon, and Shiri are said to be with Princess Katariya.

<b>

The reason is that we have completed our goal of conquering the S Rank Dungeon, so we decided to return to Lindell tomorrow. Therefore, each of us is free to enjoy ourselves without any regrets.

<b>

"What job did you come with, Noah?"

<b>

"I'm a Demon Lord~ What about you, big brother?"

<b>

"I'm a Sovereign. I thought about leveling up other third jobs, but I figured I could do that after returning to Lindell. If I don't get many chances to come here, I should enjoy myself."

<b>

I considered doing a playthrough with only first jobs, but this time I prioritized the refreshing feeling. It's my first time at a Rezell S Rank, and I want to go all out.

<b>

Currently, we are on the second layer.

<b>

The wyverns gracefully flying in the blue sky are the enemies we need to deal with in this layer.

Relying on the presence I sensed, I leisurely walk through the layer. I step on short weeds alongside a girl who looks to be in the upper grades of elementary school.

<b>

I wonder what kind of conversations Crescent and the others had while walking through this dungeon.

Considering how exhausted the Vinzett siblings were, they probably weren't as relaxed as we are...

<b>

"I'm calling!"

<b>

"Okay!"

<b>

After calling out to Noah, I shoot a magic arrow at the wyvern that still hasn't noticed us and is flying in the air. The arrow, released with a sense of the movement speed and flying distance, hits the wyvern's body.

<b>

"Headshots are tough, as expected."

<b>

"Even hitting from this distance is amazing..."

<b>

The damaged wyvern lets out an angry roar and flies straight toward us. The fire magic Noah cast is easily dodged—but the arrow she shot almost simultaneously pierces it.

<b>

"Wow, nice job, Noah."

<b>

Reading the opponent's thoughts is quite an advanced skill.

<b>

"Well, I'm a former god, you know... It's just that big brother is abnormal; I'm pretty amazing too, you know? If we're talking knowledge, I should have more than you."

<b>

"You lack practical experience."

<b>

And stop casually treating me like I'm the abnormal one. It's not just me; all hardcore gamers are like this.

<b>

And so, we have arrived at the boss room.

<b>

In a place resembling a giant bird's nest, a massive dragon with yellow and green scales is glaring at us. Its total length is about thirty meters. It's so huge that it's harder to deal with compared to other S Rank Dungeon enemies.

<b>

"I wanted a refreshing feeling, but I guess I'll impose some skill restrictions."

<b>

That said, passive skills are still active, so it's not a complete restriction. Let's say that long-range attacks with skills are off-limits.

<b>

When I conveyed this to Noah, she made a disheartened face and let out a dissatisfied "Ehh."

<b>

"I prefer magic over this kind of thing."

<b>

"Sometimes you need to train in this area too. Alright, let's go."

<b>

"Okay!"

<b>

Both of us simultaneously stomped the ground, kicking up dust as we dashed toward the wind dragon.

<b>

The enemy quickly took to the sky and opened its mouth wide to unleash a Wind Breath attack. However, it was far too slow.

<b>

Noah moved to the left, and I moved to the right, closing the distance to the dragon.

<b>

I took out my bow from my inventory, leaped up, and shot. The bow and arrows are drops from an A Rank Dungeon, and thanks to my boosted stats, I was able to deal damage to the enemy's wings.

<b>

"Hmm, weak!"

<b>

However, the weapon is indeed weak, and compared to the attack power of a Spirit Bowmaster or Sword Saint, it's somewhat lacking. The advantage of the Sovereign is being able to use all the skills learned from each job, but I'm restricting that this time. It can't be helped.

<b>

The dragon, gliding in with momentum, roars as it charges at me. Noah is shooting from the side, but the enemy ignores her and heads straight for me.

<b>

"Thanks for coming closer."

<b>

It's like a jumbo jet is flying toward me, yet I feel no fear.

I've fought this opponent many times, and I've seen this attack thousands of times.

<b>

And unlike reality, with my stats, I won't die even if I get hit—at least, I think so. If I get hit in a bad spot, that might be a different story.

<b>

"—Hah!"

<b>

I slip past the dragon's fangs and claws, stabbing my White Lotus into its belly. I pull it out in about three-tenths of a second, dodging the incoming tail—at the same time, I executed an attack. The effect of the White Lotus, "White Radiance"—"If you attack the same spot within three seconds, damage is tripled"—seems impossible this time...

<b>

"Noah, do whatever you want too!"

<b>

After the dragon passed by, I shouted toward Noah, who was a little distance away.

<b>

"Does that mean I can slack off?"

<b>

"Since we came all this way, you should enjoy it too!"

<b>

While keeping an eye on the dragon charging at me, I yelled at Noah.

I saw her shrug from a distance and forgot that we were in the middle of a battle, laughing.
