# 30 The Maiden's Strategy

<b>

<b>

<b>

The report to Lord Dino is complete.

<b>

Finally, we were supposed to be freed from the royal castle――but,

<b>

"Lord SR, please wait a moment here."

<b>

Having been told that, I sadly watched as the trajectory of Thunder and Sera left the room. I felt I understood a bit of how Sera felt being left out regarding the title.

<b>

Let's talk about the future at the guild and celebrate our achievement――was suggested by Shin, so I nodded with a wry smile.

I’m not good with alcohol. However, I can’t deny the desire to celebrate. It’s something we all accomplished together.

<b>

A few minutes after waiting in the room, it was not the maid who had brought in the cart earlier, but Shiri who came in.

<b>

"Thank you for waiting, Lord SR. I will guide you, so please follow me."

<b>

As she entered the room, she opened the door and extended her hand as if inviting me outside. It seemed this was not something that could be settled here.

Standing up from the sofa, I asked Shiri.

<b>

"Where are we going?"

<b>

"It's a secret."

<b>

She placed her index finger to her lips and winked with a hint of allure. It’s not good for a beautiful woman to learn such tricks. If I had no resistance, my face would turn into a boiled octopus in an instant.

<b>

Trying to avoid showing my flushed face, I walked diagonally behind her, gazing at the scenery of the corridor.

Somehow, this path felt familiar. Could it be a place I had been to before?

<b>

There are only a handful of places within the royal castle that I have visited.

I tried to predict the place I was being taken to among those few options.

<b>

"……I see."

<b>

Without needing to think, I arrived at the conclusion.

<b>

"Yes. Princess Fenon wishes to personally thank you, Lord SR."

<b>

"I see."

<b>

After smiling at me once, Shiri turned to knock on the door. Then she said, "I have brought Lord SR."

<b>

As I opened the door at Shiri's prompting, the girl who looked like a doll from that day was sitting on the bed, staring at me.

As always, her translucent white hair was stunningly beautiful. Its whiteness was as pure as the white of the dress she wore, completely free of any impurities. Truly pure white.

<b>

I knelt and bowed my head just like before.

<b>

"I'm glad to see you are well, um... that's good."

<b>

I have no idea how to speak to royalty!

<b>

I might have managed some simple conversation, but a slight irregularity would quickly reveal my shortcomings. And right now, I was that "shortcoming."

<b>

"Hehe, there's no need to worry, brave hero――Shiri, you may step back."

<b>

When the princess said that, Shiri bowed respectfully and left the room. I was now alone with the princess.

<b>

"Could you please take a seat here?"

<b>

"――Huh? T-That spot?"

<b>

"Yes. Right here, brave hero."

<b>

She patted the spot right next to where she was sitting on the bed.

Just sitting on a bed used by a woman was already enough to make me feel like I was going to lose my mind, and it was the bed of a princess! There was no way I could remain sane.

<b>

Feeling as if my body was constructed from rusted machinery, I somehow managed to sit in the spot the princess indicated. I kept a distance of about 50 centimeters for my mental well-being.

<b>

"Hehe."

<b>

The princess leaned closer, peering into my face, reducing the distance to 20 centimeters.

I had been promoted from a machine to a statue. …Is this really a promotion?

<b>

While I was thinking about that, she gently placed her hand over mine, which was gripping my pants on my lap.

<b>

This is bad! It’s soft! It’s warm!

What on earth is the princess doing! This is inappropriate!

<b>

My mind was in a state of panic.

I tried to calm down by counting prime numbers, but I suddenly remembered I didn’t really know what prime numbers were. I was in a state of utter confusion.

<b>

"Brave hero, thanks to you, I am alive like this. Thank you so much for saving my life."

<b>

"N-No. Obtaining the elixir was thanks to Thunder's trajectory and Sera's cooperation. It wasn't just my achievement."

<b>

She was staring intently into my eyes. It felt like she could see right through my heart.

<b>

"I see. But without the brave hero, it would have been impossible――isn't that so?"

<b>

Well, it probably would have been impossible. I wouldn’t go out of my way to say that.

<b>

"No, no. I was merely helping, so perhaps they could have cleared the B-rank dungeon without me."

<b>

"――Hehe, is that so?"

<b>

She said that with a smile that was more like that of a girl her age than a princess.

<b>

――Speaking of which.

<b>

I had something I wanted to say when I saved her. Since I have the opportunity to talk like this, I should go ahead and say it.

I’m sure Lord Dino would forgive me too.

<b>

"Um... actually, I lied to you, Princess. The truth is, I’m not a hero."

<b>

"That was when you first came to this world, right?"

<b>

"……Huh? Isn’t that the most important part?"

<b>

When I asked that, she closed her eyes and shook her head. Then, slowly lifting her eyelids, she directed her gaze back into my eyes.

<b>

"A hero is a brave person. Even knowing that clearing a B-rank dungeon in a short time would be difficult, you worked tirelessly to save my life. That is truly the act of a brave person. You are undoubtedly a hero, Lord SR."

<b>

Wow…….

She’s saying something quite similar to what His Majesty said. Speaking of which, His Majesty also mentioned something like "I realized after talking to Fenon." Could she be the cause of that?

<b>

In that case,

The "certain person" who tried to give me a title is,

<b>

"Could it be that the princess is the one who gave me the title...?"

<b>

"Yes!"

<b>

She had the brightest smile. So you were the culprit.

<b>

Was it that if Thunder's trajectory was to receive a title, then I should too――or was it that she gave me a title as a bonus while also giving Thunder's trajectory the title of "Pioneer"? Which one was it?

<b>

……Either way, since the princess wished for it, the result would be the same.

<b>

"……I see. I appreciate your kindness, Princess."

<b>

Though I was sitting on the bed, I bowed my head towards her.

Then, unexpectedly, I received a reply.

<b>

"Hehe, there's no need to worry. After all, giving a title to the brave hero was for my own convenience."

<b>

"For your convenience, Princess――is that so?"

<b>

What does that mean?

<b>

If the princess gave me a title, what benefit could she possibly gain from it?

Is she trying to use me for something? Or does this country need someone with the title of "hero"? Politics? Or something entirely different――.

<b>

As I desperately tried to understand the princess's words, she, whether knowing or not about my predicament, took my hand and held it with both of hers. Thanks to that, all my thoughts scattered into mist.

<b>

"Due to illness, the marriage with another country has been put on hold. My younger sister, the second princess of this country, is already set to marry that country."

<b>

Suddenly, she started saying such things.

I could only respond with a "Huh."

<b>

"I am of royal blood. Even if I can be selfish, the surrounding people would not accept a common explorer as my fiancé."

<b>

Imagining the future developments made cold sweat trickle down my cheeks.

No, no, that can't be right. Such a cute girl, and a princess at that? ―No way. No way.

<b>

"However, if it is someone who holds a title granted by the kingdom, it would be a different story."

<b>

H-Huh. I-I see.

<b>

Ah, I get it. This must be about Shin. He’s handsome. Being a popular guy is tough. It’s going to be hard from now on, but I hope he does his best.

<b>

My escape from reality was shattered by the next words from the princess.

With her cheeks slightly flushed, she leaned in close to me, moving her delicate lips like cherry blossom petals.

<b>

"――I am in love with you, brave hero."

<b>

Her voice was heavy and serious, leaving no room for thoughts of jokes or teasing.

<b>

There was no escape now.

Even though it was spacious, this was still a private room. Moreover, I was sitting on the bed, unable to even back away properly.

<b>

Calmly, calmly――I told myself, trying to calm my heart with Lamaze breathing. I felt like I was using it in the wrong situation, but that was not the time to worry about that.

<b>

Could it be that she mistook me for someone else?

Is she talking about someone who isn’t me?

<b>

Because, you see――

<b>

<b>

I’m not a hero.

<b>
