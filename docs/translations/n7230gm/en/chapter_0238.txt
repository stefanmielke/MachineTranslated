# A-121 VS Noah

<b>

<b>

<b>

Apologizing to the guard who was watching the dungeon, I followed Noah into the dungeon.

<b>

If she were to commit suicide, I would have to stop her even if it meant hitting her—no, I really shouldn't be in a position to say that... I was supposed to lose while fighting monsters, after all. If possible, I wanted to bring back information about strong enemies.

<b>

As I was thinking about such things, my body was teleported into the dungeon.

At the same time my vision cleared—there was Noah, glowing orange.

<b>

"What's with the 'Provocation'—what are you doing?"

<b>

I called out to Noah, who shrugged and sent me a smile.

It's a skill of the low-tier knight class that induces aggressive behavior in monsters. It's meaningless in human relationships.

<b>

"My big brother is trying to experience death himself. I don't want to put him in such a risky situation, so I want to do at least this much."

<b>

No, no, Ideya said it was 'okay,' so there shouldn't be any problem. Sure, it’s a bit scary at first, but that’s all there is to it.

She took a few steps away from me before turning back.

<b>

"So, how about we have a match? I don't want to kill myself, and it would be much better if we killed each other rather than being defeated by monsters, right?"

<b>

"No... if something happens, that would really damage my mental state."

<b>

"Ahaha, but you're really worrying too much, aren't you? There’s a difference in pain, but it's just like a game. Ideya wouldn’t tell such lies. —Besides, if it were true, you would have every right to resent me enough to want to kill me. So don’t worry about it."

<b>

Don't worry about it—yeah, that's asking too much.

I've completely forgiven her, and I understand that there were reasons for her actions. And now, I think of her as being about the same distance as family.

<b>

There’s no way I wouldn’t care about killing someone like that.

<b>

"You don't have to think so hard about it. Just enjoy the fight as usual. And—"

<b>

Just as I thought she was going to say something, a light blue barrier suddenly expanded around her. Is this the barrier technique of a 'Guardian Barrier' user? No, this is—.

<b>

"—!"

<b>

Feeling an unpleasant presence, I immediately jumped back. And as if to chase after me, the barrier protecting her grew larger, expanding to about twenty meters in diameter.

<b>

"Oh, you came as a saint. But that class isn’t really suited for solo play, is it?"

<b>

Having reached a safe zone, I took out a white lotus from my inventory and noticed Noah smirking from a distance. What she used was the third-tier class 'Saint's Absolute Barrier.' It's a skill that combines both offense and defense.

<b>

Noah displayed a menu window and took out a bow from her inventory.

Then, as she released the barrier, she touched the window and aimed the bow at the sky.

<b>

"Since there’s a house inside the dungeon— I was half in doubt, but it seems like it’s just as I expected."

<b>

While saying that, her hands began to glow a light green. The arrows released into the sky rained down on me like shooting stars.

<b>

"—Huh!? You can change classes!? I'm in tears as a Sovereign class!"

<b>

I cut down the raining arrows or dodged them to avoid the skills of the Spirit Bow user. After completely defending against them, I opened my status screen just like she did, and it really was possible to change classes. How unfair is that?

<b>

"Well, it won't hit my big brother, right? Now, how should I attack?"

<b>

As she stored the bow back in her inventory, Noah smiled as if troubled.

Is she really serious about this? Of course, being a former goddess, she must be strong, but I’ve never seen her fight seriously.

<b>

It's certain that she’s below Venom, but I have no idea what her level in PvP is.

How to fight in this situation—hmm.

<b>

If it were me, I would hide what class I’m currently fighting with. That way, the opponent would have to fight as if they were up against a Sovereign, being cautious of all my skills. That would be troublesome.

<b>

"That’s a good idea; I’ll adopt my big brother’s plan."

<b>

With a mischievous smile, Noah began to manipulate her status screen, turning her back to me.

<b>

"Hey, don’t read my mind and steal my strategy."

<b>

Once the actual fight begins, my body often moves before I can think, so it's not really a problem.

<b>

"Reading minds is a part of my power, you know? It’s just like your 'Eye of Origin,' isn't it?"

<b>

Is it really okay to say that? This eye given to me by Noah eliminates the time lag from thought to action. With reflex speeds that exceed human limits and the skill to read the opponent's thoughts—if asked which is stronger, I’d say the former.

<b>

At least, I don’t think I could fight while reading my opponent's thoughts.

<b>

"By the way, are we really going to fight?"

<b>

"Unless we do, you won’t let me die, right?"

<b>

"I can hold back enough not to kill you even if we fight."

<b>

"Haha, as expected—then I hope that becomes a good handicap!"

<b>

Saying that, Noah charged towards me. In her right hand, she held a palm-sized small knife, while her left hand was hidden behind her body.

<b>

Magic or melee?

Since I don't know how she will act, I could choose to keep my distance and shoot arrows—but that wouldn’t be fun.

<b>

"Don’t underestimate my reflexes, come at me!"

<b>

"Ah! As confident as ever—aren’t you!"

<b>

Noah closed the distance to about ten meters, then she brought her left hand in front of her body. What she was holding—was she holding anything? It didn’t seem like she was trying to activate any magic either.

<b>

At that moment, a knife was thrown at my chest. While deflecting the knife flying towards me with the white lotus, I focused on the left hand's movement, which I couldn't predict. She was stepping back while facing me with her palm—no, is that a fake!?

<b>

"That was close."

<b>

Before I knew it, she had the same knife in her right hand that she had just thrown, and she was about to make a small swing with it.

<b>

With that kind of hostile movement at this distance—well, it must be a Kairiken. That means she’s currently a Sword Saint.

However, she stopped her movement before activating the skill. There was no post-activation stiffness.

<b>

"Hmm, if I get found out before I can use it, there’s nothing I can do. Have you not graduated from being human, big brother?"

<b>

"Unwillingly, I’ve been told that often."

<b>

Back in the days of Tempest, I was told that I was 'not human.'
