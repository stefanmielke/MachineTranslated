# 76 I Can't Respond to Your Feelings

<b>

<b>

<b>

The mock battle with the Thunderbolt trajectories—training continued until after 6 PM when the sky began to darken.

I had actually planned to wrap things up a bit earlier and have a leisurely chat, but everyone was fired up, and we ended up fighting until this late.

I wouldn't mind going on until midnight, but I couldn't just ignore the six exhausted people in front of me.

<b>

Even though we took breaks, we had been engaged in combat training for over five hours, so naturally, the amount of sweat we produced was considerable. Sweating only increased the discomfort I felt.

Including myself, everyone unanimously decided that "for now, we should take a bath."

<b>

<b>

—That was the decision.

<b>

"Shouldn't we prioritize the party leader here?"

<b>

"What are you talking about, sleepyhead? Say that in your sleep."

<b>

"Besides, there are more women than men, right? There are more than double."

<b>

Currently, three sweaty people were arguing at the entrance.

<b>

"That doesn't matter. Hey, SR, don't you think we should prioritize the leader's opinion? If you're a leader too, you should think so, right?"

<b>

With a somewhat angry expression, Shin sought my agreement.

No, don't look at me. That fierce gaze feels like a wild beast invading my territory.

<b>

"I-I don't really mind either way."

<b>

"I don't mind either..."

<b>

Sera muttered quietly in agreement with me. Like me, she seemed to be trying not to stir up unnecessary trouble.

<b>

<b>

Well, whether it's the men or women who enter the open-air bath doesn't really matter to us who live here.

<b>

<b>

Shiri would likely follow her master's opinion, so I decided to look to the mischievous princess sitting to my right. When our eyes met, she smiled brightly, seemingly unconcerned about the surrounding atmosphere.

<b>

"I, of course, want to enter with SR-sama—uhm!"

<b>

Oops, I accidentally delivered a chop to her head. What an unfortunate accident.

<b>

"What are you saying, you fool?"

<b>

I’ve never had the experience of bathing with a woman, not even in my previous life.

...Let's not count my mother or a drunken Sera.

<b>

"Fenon seems to be fine with either option, just like us."

<b>

"I-I see."

<b>

Shin said, his cheeks twitching.

He was probably taken aback by my actions toward the first princess, but if we spend time together, he should understand. I used to be surprised by Sera's behavior toward Fenon too.

<b>

After that, they continued their pointless argument, and in the end, it was settled by majority vote. As expected, the women won. It was a foregone conclusion that we would lose before the competition even started.

<b>

So, I ended up taking a bath with a somewhat downcast Shin.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"Don't be so down. You can take a bath anytime, right? You could even take a morning bath tomorrow."

<b>

Leaning against the edge of the bathtub, I spoke while looking up at the ceiling.

Although the open-air bath is slightly larger than the indoor bath, the original size is spacious enough that there are no issues. Even if all five women bathed in the indoor bath at the same time, it would still be quite roomy.

If we could achieve such a bath in Japan, we would undoubtedly be winners.

<b>

"Ah, I'm not really that concerned. I was curious about the open-air bath, but this one is pretty nice too. The smell of wood is good."

<b>

Seeing Shin say that, it seemed he genuinely meant it. If that's the case, he might be more upset about the fact that he was "outvoted" rather than which bath to enter.

<b>

More importantly.

<b>

"Hey, I want to ask you something."

<b>

An unexpected moment of being alone with another man.

If I miss this chance, there might not be another opportunity for us to be alone together later. Now is the time to consult.

<b>

"What is it?" Shin said, turning his gaze toward me.

<b>

"Um, well—"

<b>

As I tried to speak, my face grew hotter and hotter.

Not wanting him to notice my nervousness, I wiped my face with the towel on my head and took a slow, deep breath.

<b>

"It's about Fenon and Sera..."

<b>

I realized I was speaking hesitantly—Shin seemed to quickly grasp what I wanted to say, and his expression turned into a clear smirk.

<b>

"Heh, it took you quite a while. Are you planning to marry both of them?"

<b>

Before I could utter the decisive words, Shin moved the conversation forward. That was a relief.

<b>

"Well, if I had to choose one, it would be difficult. In my previous region, having two partners was taboo, but it's okay here, right?"

<b>

"Yeah. No matter how many, as long as you have status and capability, it's fine. You could easily take care of ten, right?"

<b>

Ten is too many, I thought—but I decided not to interrupt as I wanted to move the conversation along.

<b>

After that, I expressed my concerns about "What if I get rejected?" and "Am I not good enough?" to which Shin repeatedly patted my back and assured me it was fine.

He teased me about how I wasn't afraid of monsters but was scared of proposing, but that was the truth, so I couldn't argue. After all, my proposal experience was zero.

<b>

After discussing various things, I decided to convey my feelings to both of them by giving them rings and bouquets. Of course, not the equipment from dungeon drops, but decorative rings.

I was also considering giving Shiri some kind of present as a thank-you for her daily help, but I couldn't think of anything specific at the moment. I'm sure if I walk around the bustling city of Reinas, I'll find something nice.

<b>

The timing for my confession would be when Shin and the others conquer an A-rank dungeon and an S-rank dungeon appears.

At that time, our party would also transition from the B-rank dungeon to the A-rank dungeon, so I want to show my sincerity to the girls who would accompany us to a more dangerous place.

<b>

Somehow, now that various plans have been decided, I felt a sense of relief.

The women should be out of the bath soon, so as I stood up to leave—

<b>

"—Wait! Let's take it a bit slower!"

<b>

In a flustered manner, Shin placed his hand on my shoulder and forcibly pushed me back into the bath.

I was left dumbfounded by this unexpected action.

<b>

"—C-Come on, since it's just the two of us guys, let's talk more. SR has some nice muscles."

<b>

Why is he speaking so flatly?

And don't stare at my body like that.

<b>

"Anyone can see I'm just skinny and squishy. My strength comes from status bonuses."

<b>

"Um, well, that squishiness is nice."

<b>

As he nodded while crossing his arms, Shin's gaze crawled over my body. Even though we were in the bath, I felt goosebumps running down my spine.

<b>

Wait... no way—

<b>

"I don't intend to judge anyone's sexual preferences, and I think same-sex relationships should be free, but sorry—I'm into women."

<b>

I had been wondering why there was no talk of romance while hanging out with Suzu and Laika, but—now I get it. Sorry for realizing it so late.

<b>

Thinking about it, it made me reconsider that the pats on my back earlier were more like body touches than encouragement.

<b>

Could it be that he mentioned "ten" as an exaggerated number to include himself in that group?

<b>

"What are you misunderstanding!?"

<b>

"D-Don't be so flustered. I'm an understanding person, so there's no need to rush. Got it? Don't rush... If you like muscles, how about Regulus?"

<b>

"Listen to what I'm saying!"

<b>

"—Huh!? You mean... Dino-sama!? Given his position as a prime minister, that's quite a high hurdle, right? Plus, I think he's married... Well, if you really want to, I'll support you as a friend. Nothing more, nothing less."

<b>

"You don't need to emphasize that!! I get it!! Please listen to me!! I'm begging you!!"

<b>

Shin shouted, looking like he was about to cry.

<b>

By the time we got out of the bath, Shin looked completely worn out, but it wasn't my fault, right?
