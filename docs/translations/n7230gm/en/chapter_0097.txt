# 94 Boss Battle and Completion

<b>

<b>

<b>

S-rank dungeon boss――the monster waiting in the final layer of this snowy dungeon is covered in a pure white fur that blends in with the snow.

<b>

Well, even though its body is white and similar in color to the snow, the differences in shading and texture prevent it from disappearing like optical camouflage. The real problem is its size.

Its total length is about 15 meters. It's incredibly huge.

The eight bulging blue eyes, each the size of a bowling ball, glimmer ominously as they stare at us, as if assessing us. Among those who played the game, there were some brave souls who referred to it as "the cute beady-eyed creature."

<b>

"That's one… big spider."

<b>

"What? If you're feeling scared, you can step back."

<b>

"Haha, there's no way I'm backing down after coming this far. Besides, what I learned from Esuar earlier would go to waste."

<b>

With a smirk, Sera laughs.

I think it's quite a formidable opponent for her, yet she shows no signs of hesitation.

<b>

"Alright, as planned, I'll charge in first, so wait for the right moment to join the attack, Sera."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

As a warm-up, I bounce lightly on the spot. The sound of crunching snow beneath my feet is quite pleasant.

After steadying my breath, I stomp the ground hard and dash forward.

<b>

"I'll keep my movements to a level that Sera can mimic with her stats."

<b>

The gigantic spider monster――Freezing Spider is an enemy I've defeated many times during the Tempest era. Due to its appearance, we call it "cotton candy."

<b>

As I charge in, the cotton candy swings its front legs, armed with crystal-like claws, in a horizontal arc. It's like the grim reaper's scythe.

In a game, I would just be blown away and take damage, but now that it's reality, it would definitely pierce through my body. Well, even if I get a hole in my body, as long as I have an elixir, the danger of dying is minimal.

<b>

"Whoa!"

<b>

I evade the scythe-like attack by moving forward, then slip past the joints and slash with my red sword before backstepping out of the cotton candy's attack range.

<b>

"Horizontal attacks are easier to deal with if you step forward without fear! For downward strikes, it's fine to dodge from the front, back, or sides! Just make sure to watch carefully before you move!"

<b>

"Got it!"

<b>

From a short distance away, I hear Sera's response.

With her talent for imitation, I bet she can almost perfectly mimic what she sees from this single exchange.

<b>

"Cheating."

<b>

As I feel a twinge of jealousy over her talent, the cotton candy lifts its body slightly.

<b>

"Watch closely! This is the freezing thread! If you get caught, you'll freeze instantly!"

<b>

While shouting, I dodge the white thread that approaches like a fired arrow.

The troublesome thing is that this cotton candy shoots threads from its belly, rear, and mouth. The motion of lifting its body gives away the timing, but the interval between the preparatory action and the attack is short. If I hesitate for even a moment, I'll be frozen in an instant.

<b>

"If dodging seems difficult, hitting the thread with your arm will only freeze your arm! Any frozen part can be broken with something hard, so there's no need to panic!"

<b>

"I just have to avoid hitting my legs, right?!"

<b>

"Exactly! When hitting the arm, just do it like this――give it a good shove, and you'll be fine!"

<b>

"I see! A good shove!"

<b>

Since we're a bit far apart, we communicate by shouting. It feels like this is draining more stamina than the actual battle.

<b>

But still, it's fun.

<b>

Maybe it's because I've been playing games alone for so long, or maybe it's because I'm teaching Sera, or perhaps it's because I'm happy to see my companion grow. I don't know.

<b>

After showcasing the battle with the cotton candy for about ten minutes, Sera finally joins in.

She gets her arms frozen a few times, but she's holding her own against the S-rank dungeon boss. There were some close calls, but I made sure to cover for her as a proper instructor.

<b>

<b>

It's been about an hour since we started working together. It's been a truly enjoyable time.

<b>

Of the eight legs of the cotton candy, half are already unusable. It seems to have no problem with balance, but it's struggling to move quickly or brace itself for attacks.

The torso is covered in numerous cuts, and green blood is flowing from various wounds, leaving it in a state of utter defeat.

<b>

That's why I found myself unable to attack.

Against attacks that I could probably dodge even with my eyes closed, I retreat without countering.

The now wobbly cotton candy is completely exposed, and I could deliver a fatal blow from any direction.

<b>

If I attack, the enemy would surely disintegrate into particles.

And if I complete the S-rank dungeon, this world would face complete collapse. In other words, Sera would also disappear.

<b>

I thought I had made up my mind…

<b>

"When I disappear from this world, will I go to heaven? Or will I lose the ability to think altogether?"

<b>

As I bit my lip, I heard Sera suddenly murmur from a few meters away.

Keeping an eye on the cotton candy while turning my gaze to Sera, I saw her staring straight at the enemy.

<b>

However, her face was tense, and her hand holding the sword was trembling.

<b>

"…I wonder. Maybe it feels the same as when you're asleep?"

<b>

"I see."

<b>

Sera replied shortly, then backstepped to evade the front leg that the monster swung down.

She opened her mouth again.

<b>

"Honestly, I'm scared. I'm scared of my body disappearing, of my memories fading away."

<b>

In a weak voice, Sera spoke as if confessing.

I replied, "That's only natural."

<b>

"Not feeling anything would be strange. It's perfectly normal to be scared."

<b>

"I thought I was fine… but when it comes down to it――look, I'm trembling, right? I might be okay against the S-rank dungeon boss, but disappearing is frightening."

<b>

With a self-deprecating laugh, she moved a little closer to me.

I dodged the thread that the cotton candy spat out and responded.

<b>

"I'll do my best to restore the world as quickly as possible. That's about all I can do."

<b>

"I'm not trying to rush you… but please don't overdo it, okay? I'm worried about Esuar being left alone. I don't think you'll lose, but Venom is still strong, right?"

<b>

Since it's said to be a god of destruction, it must be strong.

I wonder if a human can really defeat a god…

<b>

"Don't worry. You don't have to be concerned about that. I'll take care of Venom quickly and restore the world back to normal."

<b>

I said it in a bright tone.

Since the time for parting is approaching, I don't want it to end on a sad note.

<b>

"Haha, just as I expected."

<b>

"Yeah. So just wait here with peace of mind. I'll make sure to find you in the new world."

<b>

No matter how many years it takes, I will definitely defeat Venom. Please believe in me and wait.

<b>

<b>

Eventually, before either Sera or I could launch an attack, the cotton candy's entire body suddenly lost its strength. The massive amount of blood flowing from its body must have been the cause of death.

<b>

In the silver world, particles of light danced. It was as if snow was falling from the ground to the sky.

When I turned my face to the side, I noticed that Sera's body was already beginning to fade, and the scenery behind her was becoming faintly visible.

<b>

Not knowing what to say, I stared at Sera's face, and after confirming her fading body, she approached me with a serene expression.

<b>

"This is my last selfish request. Esuar."

<b>

Then, taking a larger step, she walked closer to me.

Before I knew it, she was within an unprecedented distance――literally just a breath away from me.
