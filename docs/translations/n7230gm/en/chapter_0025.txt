# 24 The Paper Evasion, Not the God Evasion

<b>

<b>

<b>

I think quite a bit of time has passed since the battle began.

<b>

The reason I'm not sure is that I'm still under attack from the Cyclops and haven't had the chance to check my status window.

I could do it if I wanted, but there's no need to take unnecessary risks. No matter how many hours pass, it ultimately comes down to whether my stamina holds out.

<b>

Since the Cyclops's axe was bothersome, I first crushed its hand. Of course, I don't have the strength to cut off that thick arm right now, so I just damaged the muscles to make it lose its grip.

<b>

With both hands incapacitated, the Cyclops discarded its axe and began to attack me with its bare hands. I then aimed for its legs.

<b>

I think I've done quite a bit of damage. While the opponent's health isn't displayed in a gauge like in a game, if it were, I would definitely say it's down by over 90%.

<b>

And my stamina was also nearing its limit.

<b>

"—This is tough. I'm in a pretty bad spot."

<b>

Since the battle began — (or rather, since I came to this world) — I haven't taken any damage, but I've been continuously dodging and attacking without rest, so I'm reaching my limits physically and in terms of muscle fatigue.

<b>

While trying to keep my legs and arms from giving out, I dodged and counterattacked as usual. There was no hesitation in my movements.

I aimed for the tendons in its legs and the back of its knees. It should be unable to stand soon.

<b>

Which will run out first, my stamina or the Cyclops's legs? I have no intention of losing, even if it's the former.

<b>

While thinking about such things, my body moved almost unconsciously. I dodged and counterattacked. The Cyclops's leg buckled for a moment. Seeing that, I couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"Alright. It looks like I'm just a few hits away from finishing this."

<b>

Finally, this long battle was about to end — just as I muttered that, my legs suddenly lost strength. Right in front of the Cyclops, I fell clumsily onto my backside.

<b>

"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Just a little more! Come on, legs!"

<b>

I patted my legs with my hands, but there was no sign they would cooperate. It felt as if I were wearing prosthetic legs, unable to exert any strength.

<b>

In front of me, the Cyclops, with a look of anger, lifted its leg back. I hurriedly stabbed my sword into the ground and used it as a third leg to stand up.

<b>

"SR!"

<b>

I heard a desperate scream from Sera.

I couldn't believe it, but she wasn't planning to use an emergency return, was she? I wouldn't allow that.

<b>

"Just watch! Don't interfere!"

<b>

With my gaze fixed on the Cyclops's leg, I raised my voice. My language became rough, but I didn't have time to worry about that.

<b>

In situations like this, I've experienced countless times.

It's not a situation where I can give up.

<b>

I stored the black sword in my inventory, used my left arm as a shield, and supported it with my right hand. Then, to soften the impact as much as possible, I jumped backward with all my strength and took the Cyclops's kick head-on.

<b>

"—Ugh!"

<b>

A nasty sound echoed, and my body flew through the air. Stomach acid was expelled from my mouth.

Even after jumping back, this was the recoil, huh?

<b>

This was the first damage I had taken since coming to this world.

It wasn't a game; it was real pain.

The shock felt like I had been hit by a truck.

<b>

It was many times more painful, difficult, and agonizing than I had imagined.

<b>

I wondered if I might die like this. That thought crossed my mind for a moment.

<b>

I could see the sky, the grasslands, the Cyclops, and then I saw Sera and the others.

<b>

If I fell and lost consciousness like this, it would be game over.

In other words, I would lose. I would lose in this world.

<b>

The princess would fall ill, and if I died right in front of them, the Thunderbolt crew might be left with emotional scars. The king and Dino, who had been concerned about me, might feel regret and sadness. And I would betray Sera's trust in me.

<b>

But that was secondary.

<b>

I had another reason I couldn't lose!

<b>

"—Ha!"

<b>

While soaring through the air, I couldn't help but laugh.

There's no way I would lose in this world; no one else but myself — my pride as someone who stands at the top wouldn't allow it.

<b>

Just before hitting the ground, I twisted my body hard to mitigate the impact by rolling. A sharp pain shot through my left arm, but that was nothing compared to the two characters that represented "defeat." In other words, I didn't have time to lament the pain.

<b>

I grit my teeth to endure the dizziness and immediately used my right hand to push myself up. Checking the enemy's position, I found I was nearly 10 meters away from the Cyclops. I must have rolled quite a distance, but it seemed I had been kicked with considerable force.

If it were my body on Earth, I might have gone to the afterlife.

<b>

The monster charged toward me with great momentum.

<b>

"—Good. That's it."

<b>

My style thrives on being attacked.

The more forceful the opponent's attack, the greater the power of my counterattack.

<b>

I took the black sword from my inventory and stood up on my trembling legs. Summoning all my will and stamina, I moved forward.

And by raising my voice, I pushed the pain in my creaking body away.

<b>

"—Ugh, go, keeeeee!!!"

<b>

The Cyclops's right arm was approaching — it could no longer form a fist and was trying to blow me away with sheer weight.

<b>

I kept my eyes wide open, never closing them. I observed.

<b>

The movement of the arm, the shift of weight, the enemy's line of sight, footwork, the state of injuries —.

<b>

From various elements, I made an intuitive judgment. The best action derived from experience.

<b>

"Uorraaahhh!"

<b>

Running forward, I pulled my sword back, the Cyclops's massive hand was closing in on me. It was like a hammer striking the New Year's bell.

The enemy's attack passed so close that it brushed against my eyelashes.

<b>

On the VRMMO Tempest discussion board, players who witnessed my battle wrote, "Not a god evasion, but a paper evasion," and also wrote like this.

<b>

<b>

It was indeed a hair's breadth — hence, a paper evasion.

<b>

<b>

The Cyclops's charging force — and my sword, laden with all my might, struck the Cyclops's ankle. From that spot, I heard a sound like something snapping.

<b>

"Not done yet!"

<b>

I slammed on the brakes, rotated my body, and then slashed at the back of its knee.

<b>

"Voooorrrr!"

<b>

The monster let out a pained scream.

Its leg crumbled, and the off-balance Cyclops twisted its body and began to fall toward me. At the same time, it raised both arms high to attack me.

<b>

Is this the last-ditch effort of a weasel? — Bring it on!

<b>

I looked up at the Cyclops and put strength into my sword-wielding hand.

<b>

Sera had made a blunder — but depending on the situation and the target area, it could become the best move.

<b>

I moved into the gap between the descending arms to evade the attack and thrust my sword upward. I felt the sensation of piercing through the eyeball and flesh transmitted through the sword.

<b>

My attack hit its mark, piercing through the Cyclops's eye and brain, penetrating its head.

<b>

That thrust became a fatal blow, and the Cyclops disintegrated into particles and vanished.

<b>

Truly by coincidence, I raised my right hand to the sky — I ended the battle with the Cyclops in a victory pose.

<b>
