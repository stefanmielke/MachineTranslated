# 71 One-Person Party

<b>

This is a story from Sera's perspective.

----------------

<b>

<b>

"I think one of the advantages of fighting in a party is that you can 'deliver continuous attacks without giving the enemy a chance to rest.'"

<b>

Fifth floor of a B-rank dungeon.

<b>

We took a break after defeating all the monsters on this floor, until the countdown timer reached zero.

Esuar sat cross-legged on the ground, continuing to speak while resting his chin on his hand.

<b>

"The boss room is wider than those on other floors. That rat is big, and it's easier for Fenon and Shiri to land their attacks, right?"

<b>

The boss of this dungeon is a giant hedgehog monster called the 'Sand Hedgehog.' Even in this party, we have already defeated this enemy over a hundred times.

Despite being a B-rank dungeon boss, the lack of tension is probably due to the reassurance of having him around.

<b>

"Is the 'continuous attack' different from the methods we've used to defeat enemies up to this point?"

<b>

Next to me, Fenon, sitting on a cushion in a seiza position, asked Esuar

<b>

If she hadn't asked this question, I would have probably asked the same thing.

Shiri would hold the enemy at bay with arrows while I attacked with my sword. When the enemy flinched, Fenon's magic would strike. On the days Esuar went to A-rank dungeons on his days off, we spent our time practicing this.

I believed that the results of our practice were sufficiently demonstrated in actual combat.

<b>

In response to Fenon's question, Esuar shook his head, saying, "No, no."

<b>

"Certainly, we've been coordinating our attacks up to now. I think Sera and the others have improved quite a bit, but compared to the guys I used to compete with—the party I was in back in the previous world—it's still lacking."

<b>

"What specifically is lacking?"

<b>

I asked him while thinking of an answer in my head.

<b>

Even though a strong person like Esuar has joined us, I believe our party's strength stands out compared to others.

<b>

It seems Fenon and Shiri are finding time to train, and I also don't neglect my daily training. Now, even the boss of a B-rank dungeon can be defeated in an hour if we work together.

<b>

What I'm trying to say is, "Isn't it enough as we are now?" If we continue to level up smoothly, I think we can reach even greater heights.

<b>

"Don't make such a dissatisfied face. I know you all are doing your best."

<b>

Ugh... It seems my feelings were showing on my face. How embarrassing.

<b>

Esuar said to us with a gentle smile.

<b>

"So, to be specific—it's not just accuracy, but more than anything, the speed is lacking. I'll show you how it's done in an actual boss fight, so remember the tempo. Pay attention to how the enemy flinches."

<b>

With that, Esuar stood up from the ground and brushed the sand off his pants. Then, he touched the option 'Challenge the Boss' displayed on the window screen.

<b>

Esuar is going to show us? The party's fighting style, by himself?

<b>

Before my doubts could escape my lips, the scene shifted to the boss room.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"Alright, I'm off."

<b>

With that, he spun his shoulder holding the red sword and headed toward the boss, the Sand Hedgehog.

His casualness was no different from when he said, "I'm going shopping."

<b>

"I know Esuar will be fine, but... still, it's unsettling to challenge that large monster alone."

<b>

Shiri placed her hand on her chest as if to calm her heartbeat.

<b>

"That's true. It's been since the martial arts tournament since I've seen him fight properly."

<b>

"That's right. It's certain that he's become even stronger since then, so it might be rude to worry."

<b>

Fenon said this while keeping her eyes on Esuar's back.

She was right. I should trust Esuar and focus on memorizing his movements.

<b>

"Let's watch and learn. That's the only thing we can do right now."

<b>

At my words, Fenon and Shiri nodded seriously.

What kind of fight will he show us?

<b>

<b>

Currently, his profession is a magic archer. His level is over 40, and he has acquired the skill 'Magic Arrow,' which generates bows and arrows using magical power.

<b>

He closed the distance to the boss quickly, pointing his left index finger at the enemy while pulling the sword in his right hand back as if drawing a bow. The distance to the enemy was now ten meters.

<b>

A blue-white glowing bow and arrow appeared in Esuar's hand, and the arrow was shot at the Sand Hedgehog. It was the magic archer's skill—Magic Arrow.

The moment the arrow left his hand, Esuar's left hand began to glow red.

<b>

Esuar rushed forward to close the distance to the enemy as the arrow flew.

<b>

The Magic Arrow accurately struck the enemy's forehead, and the Sand Hedgehog let out a cry of pain, leaning back slightly. Esuar slipped into the now-open space and slashed the enemy's jaw with the red sword.

<b>

Just as I thought he had slashed upward, a magic skill—Launch Magic was already being unleashed from Esuar's left hand. It seemed he had been preparing to activate this right after releasing the Magic Arrow.

<b>

Switching the sword to his left hand, he punched the enemy's stomach with his right fist—the left hand holding the sword was already in the position to activate the Magic Arrow, as if drawing a bow.

<b>

<b>

Dodododododododododod――.

<b>

<b>

A continuous sound like an earthquake, unending and relentless.

We had no time to express our thoughts. We were barely able to keep our eyes on his overwhelming violence. The boss was given no chance to counterattack, let alone defend.

<b>

Is he... really the same human as us? Such disrespectful thoughts crossed my mind.

I thought I had worked hard to become strong—his skills effortlessly shattered that illusion of ours. I felt foolish for getting carried away, thinking of him as the reincarnation of a sword saint.

<b>

<b>

It all happened in the blink of an eye.

<b>

He defeated the boss, the Sand Hedgehog, in less than thirty minutes.

Even though he had the 'Ring of Strength' that increases STR on his left hand, it was clearly abnormal. It was a battle that made it impossible not to feel the difference in caliber.

<b>

Esuar, showing no signs of fatigue, turned to us and innocently asked, "Did you get it?"

He had called me 'good at remembering,' but honestly, I felt like I couldn't replicate this.

<b>

What do you mean by 'if we work together'?

I felt embarrassed for having thought that.

<b>

We were still, as always, his burden.

<b>

The words he had said before challenging the boss—'lacking'—now weighed heavily on me.

<b>

Esuar was right.

Levels, skills, effort—still not enough.

<b>

"…Seriously, I've set my sights on an incredible person."

<b>

As I waved back at Esuar, who was waving at me, I muttered softly.
