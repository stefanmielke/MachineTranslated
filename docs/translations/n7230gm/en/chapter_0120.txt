# A-6 Request to ASR

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day after the ceremony.

Even though it was only 9 AM, the town below the castle was already enveloped in noise.

I had to visit several inns yesterday to find a place to stay, and it’s safe to say that many people from other towns have flocked here to see the Thunderbolt Parade.

<b>

"I hear the parade starts at noon, yet... there are already so many people."

<b>

Sera, walking to my left, says while observing the passersby.

It's not so crowded that there's no room to walk, but compared to usual, the population density is quite high. It’s not a situation where we can walk side by side, so Sera, Fenon, and I are walking ahead, while Noah and Shiri follow behind us.

<b>

"Even though we're in disguise, those who know us will recognize us, so be careful."

<b>

Since there's a possibility that the security might be temporarily worse, I give a precautionary warning.

Of course, the four of us whose faces are well-known are being cautious, and today I’ve also changed my hair color using a magical tool. It’s silver. Cool.

<b>

"I understand! Besides, my bodyguards are probably watching from somewhere, so it’ll be fine."

<b>

Fenon replies promptly to my words. Following that, Sera also responds to me with "Of course."

<b>

"You can relax because I'm here too."

<b>

"Ah... Noah must be a nemesis for criminals."

<b>

"With Noah around, it's impossible to have any bad thoughts."

<b>

As Shiri pointed out, trying to do something strange in front of Noah would be obvious. After all, she can read what you're thinking.

It seems like any plans would be crushed before they could be executed, and even if I weren't here, there’s no way anyone could escape from this group.

<b>

Having knowledge of status bonuses and such, they are undoubtedly among the top tier of inhabitants in this world. If it weren't for the Thunderbolt, they would have definitely won the international martial arts tournament.

<b>

As for vigilance, I currently have the profession of Overlord, so the effect of the swordsman skill 'Presence Detection' is in effect.

<b>

In the game era, it was a rough ability to sense the presence of monsters and people, but now I can also somewhat discern those with malicious intent.

It might be something akin to a sixth sense that awakened to protect my loved ones, but... well, that doesn’t really matter.

<b>

"There are many shops we don’t usually see, so let’s look around."

<b>

As I say this while glancing at each of the four members of ASR, they all nodded enthusiastically, their eyes sparkling. Even before we started looking around, they seemed to be having a great time.

<b>

Shooting games, ring toss, lottery.

There were stalls reminiscent of summer festivals in Japan, and even I, who should have the second highest mental age among the members, was enjoying the bustling capital city as much as the women—if not more. Apparently, there will be fireworks at night, so I definitely want to see that too.

<b>

Among them, the one enjoying the festival the most is probably Noah, who looks the youngest but is actually the oldest at heart.

Her demeanor is as if she is releasing the stress accumulated from her divine duties, and she looks nothing like the former administrator. Just a moment ago, she was shooting at the vendor with a toy gun.

<b>

"Were you trying to take the vendor home? That guy isn’t a prize."

<b>

"That’s not it! I just misfired!"

<b>

"I-I’m not trying to take the shopkeeper home either! So it’s not cheating! D-Don’t misunderstand!"

<b>

Following Noah, Sera hurriedly says.

She also had just perfectly placed a ring used for the ring toss on the shopkeeper's head... I think that’s the more difficult feat.

<b>

I replied to Sera with a smile, "I know," but she looked at me with a desperate expression, asking, "Is that really true!? Do you really understand!?" I sent a HELP glance to Fenon and Shiri, but they only returned a wry smile.

<b>

As we were having such a peaceful exchange――

<b>

"I apologize if I’m mistaken. Are you perhaps the explorer party ASR?"

<b>

A person came running towards us, placing their hands on their knees and breathing heavily as they called out to us. From their expression and demeanor, it seemed they had urgent business.

I was somewhat taken aback by the unexpected appearance of this individual, but I nodded and responded.

<b>

"Even though we were in disguise―― you recognized us well. But why is the guild master of Reinas in the capital?"

<b>

"If you observe the way we walk, you can tell. I took on a security job while watching the parade. It seems they are short on personnel here, and work in Reinas is calm right now. By the way, um―― you’re Noah-chan’s brother, right? I believe it’s Esu-aru-kun? Nice to meet you."

<b>

Still in a crouched position, the guild master of Reinas―― Mr. Raires extended his hand towards me. I shook it back while greeting him with "Nice to meet you" as well.

<b>

"I was doing chores like restocking items while they were at the guild. I’m sorry for the late introduction."

<b>

Even though I’m just a chore boy, I’m still a member of ASR, so it shouldn’t feel out of place for me to report to the guild with them. However, there’s a proper reason why I didn’t show myself in front of Mr. Raires.

<b>

"「「「………………」」」"

<b>

When I refer to myself as a "chore boy" or make a display of my incompetence, the other three, except for Noah, show very dissatisfied expressions. I appreciate their feelings, but I wish they wouldn’t let it show on their faces.

<b>

"You don’t need to worry about that. I’d like to talk with you more leisurely, but let’s save that for another time."

<b>

Fortunately, it seemed Mr. Raires didn’t notice the change in their expressions. Even if he did, I don’t think my true position in ASR would be revealed, but it’s better to be cautious.

<b>

Mr. Raires then took a few deep breaths and straightened his posture. With an apologetic expression, he slowly opened his mouth.

<b>

"I’d like to request a job from you ASR."
