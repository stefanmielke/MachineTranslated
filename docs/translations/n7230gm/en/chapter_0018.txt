# 17 Operation Meeting

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Shall we start with an explanation of the derived secondary jobs?"

<b>

<b>

With my statement, the room fell silent.

No, it's not that they are surprised by my words. They probably think something like, "What is this guy talking about?"

As evidence of that, their gazes are directed not at me, but at the status window.

<b>

Good, good―― that's a favorable reaction. Explorers―― especially those in higher positions, would likely find this information interesting.

Now, to get the members of Thunder's Trail hooked, let's drop another bombshell.

<b>

I touched the professions and displayed the list of jobs.

What appeared were five primary jobs, five secondary jobs, and two derived secondary jobs.

<b>

"Derived secondary jobs―― for now, let's call them derived advanced jobs. I know how to change to professions that you are still unaware of. By the way, I don't intend to answer the question of why I know this―― that's not important right now."

<b>

In the displayed list of professions, besides the martial swordsman, the barrier magician is also shown.

<b>

The first to speak up was Sera.

<b>

"Esuar. So, if we change to that profession, we will be able to save Her Highness the Princess?"

<b>

In response to her question, I shook my head.

<b>

"We don't have that kind of time. I just wanted you to understand that 'I know things you don't.' Anyway, I'm planning to inform the kingdom about the other derived advanced jobs as well."

<b>

When I answered Sera like that, Regulus opened his mouth next.

<b>

"Hey, Esuar. You told us to keep this quiet from His Majesty, right? Just this alone is quite a serious matter, but does that mean there's more?"

<b>

I felt like there was an underlying sentiment of 'please spare us' in those words. Of course, I won't spare them.

<b>

"Yes. The content is crucial for saving the Princess―― in other words, it is the key needed for conquering B-rank dungeons. From here on, it will be classified information, so Regulus, please do that thing."

<b>

After directing my gaze, I prompted him, and Regulus slowly nodded, then took out five pledge documents from his inventory. The edges of the paper bore the kingdom's seal, and just by looking at it, I could tell that the quality of the paper was quite high.

<b>

The papers were distributed to the four others, with one being held by Regulus himself.

<b>

"I thought it was just a discussion, but now I have to write a pledge..."

<b>

"The content is what it is. It can't be helped."

<b>

"Right. Let's decide whether to sign after seeing the content."

<b>

Thunder's Trail, without any particular objections, began to read the contents of the distributed pledge documents. Even though Shin seemed to express annoyance verbally, his expression was completely serious. It seems that the information I possess is something they desperately want.

<b>

"There’s a long-winded paragraph written here, but in short, it states that the content of this discussion and what you learn here is prohibited from leaking outside. This includes His Majesty as well."

<b>

"Even His Majesty... just how serious is this content..."

<b>

Shin said with a strained expression.

Wait, wait. If I scare them too much and they decide to back out, that would be a problem. The purpose of Sera bringing them here would be lost.

<b>

"You don't need to worry that much. If you don't say anything, it will never be found out. Even if you slip up, it should be fine. The person you tell won't understand unless they receive a proper explanation."

<b>

I said in as gentle and bright a tone as possible. Perhaps it worked, as Shin muttered, "If that's the case..." and returned his gaze to the pledge document.

<b>

"...The penalty is permanent revocation of the explorer's license."

<b>

"By the way, mine is resignation as guild master and permanent revocation of my license. Isn't that amusing?"

<b>

Regulus let out a dry laugh as he showed the pledge document he held to Shin. You prepared that yourself, didn't you?

The fact that his penalty is heavier than Thunder's Trail's might indicate that he is particularly resolute. Or perhaps he feels responsible for involving Thunder's Trail.

<b>

I don't mind either way.

<b>

"If you agree, please sign."

<b>

As I prompted to move the conversation along, Sera immediately responded, "Understood," and without a moment's hesitation, wrote her name.

<b>

"Whoa, that was a quick decision... You really have guts, don't you?"

<b>

"Guts are unnecessary. I trust Esuar."

<b>

That's nice to hear.

<b>

"...By the way, did you say Esuar? Aren't you going to write anything?"

<b>

With his elbow on the table and chin resting on his hand, Shin asked.

Hmm. It is indeed unfair for me to not write anything.

<b>

"Right. I should write something too. How about this―― 'If the content of the discussion is false'?"

<b>

"Ah, that's fine. What about the penalty? Are you also going for permanent revocation of your license?"

<b>

"I'll take the death penalty. I don't intend to lie anyway."

<b>

".................."

<b>

Huh? Why is everyone suddenly silent?

I looked around the room, but they were all looking at me as if I were a disappointing child. What’s that about?

<b>

Eventually, the party leader, Shin, scratched his head and spoke up.

<b>

"Ah, forget it. I get it. You don't have to write a pledge. If you say you can get stronger, then I'll sign too. Is everyone okay with that?"

<b>

"If Shin is okay with it, then it's fine."

<b>

"Yes, that's fine."

<b>

In response to Shin's inquiry, the two women sitting next to him expressed their agreement. Once the three finished signing, Regulus took the pen last and said, "Then I'll write too."

What? In the end, I don't have a pledge. I feel a bit left out and lonely.

<b>

After confirming that everyone had signed, I stood up and bowed my head in gratitude.

<b>

Now the preparations are complete. Let's get started with the secret meeting.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

Thirty minutes had passed since I began discussing player bonuses. Since the name sounded somewhat game-like, I explained it to them as "status bonuses."

<b>

The term "status" itself is a game to me, but it seems to be normal for them living in this world, so perhaps it was an unnecessary change.

<b>

"That concludes my explanation. Do you have any questions?"

<b>

After finishing my explanation, I sat down in my chair. I let out a sigh and quenched my throat with tea.

No one asked any questions, but Regulus and Sera had expressions of understanding.

<b>

"So that's why you wanted to stay at the lower jobs and not enter anything other than F-rank dungeons... If I knew that content, I would do the same."

<b>

"Indeed. I finally understand why Esuar was only leveling up lower jobs. It was necessary."

<b>

To someone from this world who knows nothing, they would probably tilt their heads or laugh at my actions upon learning about them.

However, since I don't present my status when diving into dungeons, the only ones who know that I am diving as a lower job are probably some people from the guild, Sera, and perhaps Lady Dino.

<b>

I'll leave the guild matters to Regulus, and I should also think about how to deceive Lady Dino soon.

<b>

As I was satisfied with Regulus and Sera's reactions, a question flew in from Suz, a member of Thunder's Trail.

<b>

"I understand the conditions for changing to derived advanced jobs and the status bonuses. When Esuar showed us the list of jobs, all the lower jobs were at level 30, so it all adds up."

<b>

"I'm glad you believe me."

<b>

"Yes. So, you didn't call us here just to talk about that, right? Is it related to conquering the B-rank dungeon?"

<b>

"Yes. You're correct. Before we discuss what comes next, could you please tell me your current jobs and levels?"

<b>

The secondary jobs they currently hold all seem to have stat imbalances. This time, I plan to have them compensate for their lacking stats with player bonuses.

With seven days, it should be possible to level one primary job to level 30.

<b>

"I'm a priest at level 80."

<b>

"I'm a mighty warrior at level 80."

<b>

"I'm a swordsman at level 80."

<b>

"I'm a heavy knight at level 80."

<b>

The last to speak was Regulus, the guild master. You didn't need to say that; it's not necessary. Why are you looking so proud?

<b>

"I'm a swordsman at level 60."

<b>

Sera, you don't need to say that either. I already know.

<b>

"I see, understood. Now, please tell me your combat styles."

<b>

After that, I listened to Shin, Suz, and Laika in order. I decided that each of them would change to the lower jobs of brawler, mage, and swordsman.

<b>

By the way, Sera is an archer. I decided that without discussion, based on her rough sword swings, it would be better to raise her DEX to compensate a bit.

<b>

"Um, excuse me. Can I ask something?"

<b>

Laika raised her hand hesitantly.

<b>

"Yes, what is it?"

<b>

"Honestly, I have no talent for swords... and I'm not confident at all."

<b>

She looked up at me with an apologetic expression.

Could it be that in this world, it is common sense to use weapons according to one's profession? If that's the case, then throw that common sense in the trash.

<b>

"It doesn't really matter. An archer can hit enemies, and a priest can cut enemies with a sword. I also used a sword to level up all the lower jobs. I think Laika can fight in a style that suits her without worrying about her profession. Just be aware that you won't be able to use the skills of a brawler or mighty warrior."

<b>

"I-I understand."

<b>

As she replied, she let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

Now, this is where the real persuasion begins.

<b>

"First, I apologize for saying this, but it's necessary. I've heard that Thunder's Trail's highest record is the third layer of the B-rank dungeon. Is that correct?"

<b>

"Yeah. That's right."

<b>

Shin answered a bit proudly.

<b>

What I'm about to say will likely hurt their pride, so I feel a bit hesitant as the one proposing it. However, it's the most certain way.

<b>

"Honestly, with a party of three at that level, if you're just lingering around the third layer, even with one status bonus, it will be difficult to conquer it. Even if Sera joins, the risk of casualties is quite high."

<b>

Even if I dive solo, I wouldn't be able to hold up.

<b>

And even with a five-person party including me, the risk of someone getting seriously injured cannot be denied. At worst, there could be fatalities. Besides, I'm not good at party combat anyway.

<b>

So what should we do?

<b>

I had already thought of the best method the day I heard that the princess's condition had worsened.

<b>
