# A-24 Someday, for sure

<b>

Rarely from Shin's perspective.

<b>

<b>

Alright, let's get started.

<b>

With a lackadaisical shout from SR, the four-on-one mock battle began. Just five seconds after the start, we were already being scattered by SR.

<b>

Jill and Arnold were lying face down on the ground groaning, and even I, a member of the party that holds the title of the world's strongest, was pathetically kneeling. Noah, though wobbling, was already back on her feet, as expected.

<b>

I mean, can a mere human really blow away a god so easily? I remember Noah saying she had lost her powers as a god, but this is just too much.

<b>

Surely, it's not just about status; every single aspect of how she uses her body is on a different level than ours.

<b>

"Couldn't Noah's mind-reading predict her movements—?"

<b>

As I put my hands on my knees and stood up, I voiced my doubt.

<b>

"Impossible, impossible. Big brother has no time lag between receiving visual information and taking action. Even if you read his thoughts, it would be too late. Plus, he's thinking about various things at the same time... I wonder what kind of brain structure he has."

<b>

"That's... cheating."

<b>

"Mind-reading is supposed to be a bit of a cheat too—!"

<b>

Noah complained, then leaped off the ground with such force that it dug into the earth, charging toward SR with great speed. She was faster than anyone else present, except for the opponent, of course.

In her right hand was a sword, and in her left hand was a fire spell ready to be unleashed.

<b>

At the same time Noah dashed forward, Jill, who had somehow gotten back on her feet, also ran toward SR. With eyes filled with fighting spirit and a quick recovery, it seemed both of them were still far from broken.

<b>

"This is my way of thinking—well, my method, actually."

<b>

SR murmured, showing no sign of feeling threatened by the approaching duo.

<b>

"In a multi-against-one scenario, it's important to utilize the opponent's strength and grasp the overall situation."

<b>

As she said this, SR swayed her body with a strange weight shift, and in the next moment, she was right in front of Noah.

She swept Noah's legs, holding her right hand before she could swing her sword. Then, using the momentum of the charge, she spun around and tossed Noah toward Arnold, who was trying to stand up unsteadily.

<b>

"Ugh!"

<b>

"—Sorry about that."

<b>

Noah's feet, having adjusted in mid-air, slammed into Arnold's face, but she seemed unharmed. But is that okay? Why does Arnold have such a delighted smile on his face?

<b>

More importantly, there's SR.

<b>

As I turned my attention to the match, Jill was crouching down, astonished by the approaching fire spell.

<b>

SR had said she wouldn't use skills... which means that fire spell was the one Noah had prepared earlier...? Did she even use that?

<b>

"You're out!"

<b>

Saying this, SR, without caring that her opponent was a seemingly young girl, delivered a heavy kick to Jill's midsection, who was distracted by the spell. The painful sound made us wince.

I managed to catch Jill, who had been blown away like trash, using my whole body. I thought I had slowed her down, but she still rolled several meters on the ground. What kind of power did that kick have?

<b>

Jill put her hands on the ground and coughed up gastric juice with a pained expression.

With tears in her eyes, she glared fiercely in SR's direction.

<b>

"—Cough! What the hell was that—what the hell was that?!"

<b>

Unbelievable. Impossible.

Jill's words seemed to echo her disbelief.

<b>

I understand how she feels, Jill.

When I saw SR face off against the Cyclops, I wanted to question the existence of such a person. Even back then, when our levels were low, we were astonished. What Jill and Arnold are feeling now might be close to sheer terror.

<b>

It's like we can't even compete.

I can't envision a victory at all.

No matter how many allies we gather, I don't even know if we can inflict a scratch.

<b>

"Don't say 'that thing'... She's our mentor and—"

<b>

And the evil god Venom— the hero who killed gods and saved the world,

<b>

"She's the pinnacle of this world."

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

The match was supposed to have a ten-minute time limit, but by the time five minutes had passed, we were already on the verge of collapse, rolling on the ground for the remainder of the time.

<b>

SR was distributing elixirs to us as we lay defeated, saying, "Drink up."

You must be thirsty, right? Here, have some water—she handed them over with that kind of vibe, but those are considered precious items in the general public, you know? I've been dulled by someone recently, but there are still very few in circulation. Arnold is clearly shaken.

<b>

"Since the slime is still alive, feel free to rest as long as you want. It was the right choice to leave it behind, just as Arnold said."

<b>

I hadn't even factored in the break time—while saying this, SR poked the bouncing slime with her finger. It looked like she was playing with it, but that's an enemy.

<b>

"Are you satisfied? Big brother's serious self is not like this, but she was strong, right?"

<b>

Noah, propped up on her upper body with her legs stretched out, asked Jill, who was nearby. Jill and Arnold were still on the ground, trying to catch their breath. The elixirs had likely healed their wounds and pain, but the fatigue remained.

<b>

"...I think I might have a few cracked bones, probably. They're healed now, though."

<b>

"If you had been attacked seriously, you would have broken. In fact, we both would have died."

<b>

"...That seems likely... Hah... It's so far removed from reality that it feels unreal. I keep thinking that what just happened was a dream. Does SR have multiple brains and eyes? That's impossible."

<b>

"Haha, I can understand why you'd want to think that, but she has the same number as a normal person. Her eyes are just really good."

<b>

"I don't think that's a problem that can be solved with just that... I think I understand why the Lindell Kingdom stands out from other countries."

<b>

"Hehe, for now, I'll just say 'correct'—that's all."

<b>

Noah probably read Jill's mind.

Since the opponent hadn't voiced a question, it wouldn't be definitive. It would be different if they knew about Noah's mind-reading.

<b>

Most likely, it was something like, "Wasn't it SR who truly discovered the profession?" or "Wasn't it SR who conquered the B-rank dungeon and saved the princess?" or something along those lines.

As for the second point, it might be in between correct and incorrect.

<b>

"Ugh... It's painful to think about what Suz and Laika will ask..."

<b>

I got beaten up as usual... How pathetic it is for the leader to have to answer that. They might forgive me with a "It can't be helped," but I will never give up. I won't easily accept defeat.

<b>

I will become stronger and someday I will defeat SR.
