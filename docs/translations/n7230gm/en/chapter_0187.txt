# A-70 Off to the New Home

<b>

<b>

<b>

The carriage carrying the five members of ASR, including myself, arrived in the city of Leinas, accompanied by guards who seemed to feel little necessity for their presence.

Since they serve the royal family, they probably have the spirit to protect Fenon at all costs. I doubt that the first princess of Lindale would easily succumb to any ordinary attack.

<b>

As I swayed in the carriage, I wondered where the Thunder Trails were――but it seemed that my arrival in this city had already been communicated, as the Thunder Trails were waiting for us at the entrance of the city.

<b>

"Welcome back. Have you grown a bit taller?"

<b>

First, Shin casually spoke to me as if we had just met two days ago.

<b>

"I don't think you can grow that much in just three months... or can you?"

<b>

I was thinking based on my past self in Japan, but upon reflection, this body might still be in its growth phase. But then again... the thought of my hitbox expanding complicates things. I'm also worried that my reach extending might mess with my ingrained instincts.

<b>

As I was lost in such game-like thoughts, Suzu and Laika, who were standing beside Shin, also chimed in.

<b>

"Welcome back, everyone. Did you enjoy your trip?"

<b>

"Did you bring back any souvenirs?"

<b>

Suzu's words, which seemed to imply that receiving something was a given, made me tense up. I had completely forgotten.

As I desperately tried to think of an excuse, Shiri pulled out a beautifully wrapped package and handed it to Shin, saying, "Of course, we have prepared something."

<b>

I let out a quiet sigh of relief and listened to their conversation. It seemed that what Shiri had given was a famous sweet from the Palmour Kingdom. When did she even buy it? Is it some kind of special ability of maids? I want to eat some too, but do I have my own portion?

<b>

"Since ASR seemed to have a lot going on, we picked out some nice things for you. Was there any problem?"

<b>

"Ah, no. No problem at all."

<b>

It's not like I could help forgetting. A former loner isn't accustomed to such events.

<b>

Originally serving as a party house, our home near Leinas is set to become the new residence for me, Sera, and Fenon――though it seems a bit unfair that Noah and Shiri, who have spent so much time together with us, are left out.

<b>

I believe it was decided that the newly expanded house would have a total of five bedrooms, just like the party house in the royal capital. During the discussions about this, Shiri seemed a bit embarrassed, and Noah's smirk was quite memorable.

<b>

After spending a night in Leinas, we added the members who came with us from the royal capital to the Thunder Trails and finally headed to our new home.

With the addition of the Thunder Trails, the guards looked even more uneasy. I could occasionally see expressions of apology on their faces.

In the unlikely event that bandits showed up, we would probably be the ones fighting rather than being protected. I suppose that's just how it is.

<b>

<b>

"Wow!!"

<b>

Finally, we arrived at our new home.

As soon as I got off the carriage, I couldn't help but utter such a cliché phrase. Because it really is big.

<b>

The house is, of course, large, but the garden is enormous. There's even something resembling a pond.

Taking advantage of the lack of nearby houses, the property has been expanded extensively, with beautiful landscaping planted here and there. The parts hidden by the fence are probably filled with flowers as well.

A fence for preventing intrusions is installed on top of the brick wall, but... I wonder how effective that is in this world... A moderately leveled explorer could probably just jump over it.

<b>

"First, the contractor will give us an explanation, so we can take our time looking around afterward."

<b>

To calm my excitement, Shiri said with a wry smile.

Yes... I had a feeling when I saw the person standing straight in front of the gate. There's no way there wouldn't be anyone present during the handover.

<b>

"Hey, Shin. Can you talk to those people for us?"

<b>

"That's a bit unreasonable. That's the job of the people living here."

<b>

"Then Noah, it's up to you."

<b>

"Alright, alright. You can't just say whatever you want. The homeowner needs to listen to the details."

<b>

Shut up.

As an explorer, I find it more enjoyable to be in a trial-and-error state rather than being guided in detail.

<b>

"Let's keep the tour brief. I want to take my time looking around with just family."

<b>

Fenon offered a helping hand with a cheerful expression, seeing my dissatisfied face.

Oh... as expected of my wife――I thought something embarrassing like that.

<b>

"Hey, big brother, you just thought, 'as expected of my wife'――didn't you?"

<b>

I'll knock you out, you little brat.

<b>

"Hold on, you little brat. When did I say it was okay to read my mind? I never said that, did I? Is a punishment necessary? Do you want a spanking? Huh?"

<b>

"My bottom? If you want to touch my bottom, you should just say so honestly."

<b>

"That's not what I meant! Ah... is there no culture of spanking in this world――though Noah knows about Earth too! I won't be fooled!"

<b>

As I scolded Noah, who was acting all innocent while whispering, "tee hee," I caught sight of Fenon, who was shyly looking down, and Sera, who seemed to be all fired up.

<b>

"Uh, Esuar! If it's about bottoms, my well-trained one is――"

<b>

"Um, I don't mind talking about that, but maybe not in front of others..."

<b>

For some reason, my wives started talking about the premise of having their bottoms touched.

As Fenon said, it's not a conversation meant for public discussion. Moreover, the ones speaking are a princess and a count's daughter. Am I going to get scolded by the king?

<b>

"I'm sorry, both of you. It was my fault, so please forget about this conversation."

<b>

And then there's Shiri, who hadn't participated in the conversation.

She seemed to have been quietly stroking her own bottom to check the sensation, but I have no intention of touching it, okay?
