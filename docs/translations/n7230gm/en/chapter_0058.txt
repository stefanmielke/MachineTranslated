# 56 The Power of the Kingdom's Top

<b>

<b>

<b>

"When I face you like this, it feels strangely surreal."

<b>

"It's refreshing. While we've fought side by side, we've never had a proper mock battle."

<b>

Ignoring the restless audience, I converse with Jinrai's trajectory.

<b>

After the party battle by the knight order, I thought Jinrai's trajectory would fight the winning party, but since I ended up in the match, that battle seems to have been omitted.

<b>

Did the knight order's champion not want to fight Jinrai's trajectory――,

Did I take that opportunity away from them――,

<b>

I felt a bit anxious, but according to Shin, the knights were rather relieved to avoid fighting Jinrai's trajectory.

I realized once again that their strength is recognized throughout the country――.

<b>

"Are you good at one-on-one battles?"

<b>

"It's a bit harder compared to fighting monsters, but it's interesting because there's more to think about――how about you?"

<b>

"Pretty much the same. However, it's my first time facing a human instead of a monster..."

<b>

"I think Esuar is fine on par with monsters."

<b>

"I'm not a monster!"

<b>

While I was indignant, Suzu stuck out her tongue and said, "Just kidding."

That’s really a joke, right? You’re not serious, are you?

<b>

As we exchanged such trivial conversations, the referee, Regulus, approached with a big sigh.

<b>

"Don't you feel any tension? The royal family is watching, you know?"

<b>

"I'm not particularly tense."

<b>

While I would feel nervous if told to speak face to face, I wouldn't shrink just because they were watching the match.

After all, when I was playing Tempest's game, it wasn't just the people in the arena; the match was broadcasted, so the number of viewers was on a different scale. If I were to tense up at this level, I wouldn't be able to rank high.

<b>

Regulus seemed exasperated and briefly glanced at the place where the royalty was seated.

I followed his gaze and turned my face toward the luxurious audience. I quickly spotted the king and Lord Dino, but I couldn't find the mischievous princess, who was part of our party.

<b>

As I searched around, I discovered her sitting properly next to Sera. That was the spot I had occupied in the morning. Perhaps Fenon was considerate since Sera would be alone.

<b>

Including the royalty, the audience's gaze seemed to be mainly focused on me――or at least that's how it felt. I couldn't say for sure due to the distance, but objectively speaking, a person with the title of "Hero" was about to have an impromptu match against Jinrai's trajectory. It's only natural to attract attention.

<b>

With this match, my goal is to improve the perception of "Is this what a Hero is like? Oh," while appropriately demonstrating my strength.

<b>

"For now, give it your all. Even if something happens, I have elixirs, so it's all good."

<b>

"I was going to do that anyway. I know you're strong, but if you underestimate us too much, you'll regret it."

<b>

"We're growing too, you know."

<b>

"I'm looking forward to seeing how long you can maintain that composure."

<b>

Oh, oh. They're getting pumped up nicely. I'm looking forward to this.

<b>

I've soloed the boss of a B-rank dungeon.

In other words, they have to face enemies stronger than a cyclops.

Yet, there's not a hint of despair or fear in Shin and the others' expressions. It's a pleasant surprise, but also strange.

<b>

"Regulus, let's start the match already."

<b>

"I was waiting for you to finish talking..."

<b>

"A man who worries about the details won't get any love."

<b>

"I have a wife and kids! Just hurry up and get some distance!"

<b>

"「「「「Okay!」」」」"

<b>

When the four of us responded in unison, Regulus let out a quiet sigh.

<b>

<b>

After receiving the rules explanation from Regulus, all that was left was to wait for the signal to start the match.

The moment he says "Begin," Jinrai's trajectory will launch their attacks.

<b>

As if sensing the atmosphere of the match about to start, the audience's voices gradually quieted down. Eventually, the surroundings became so silent that I could even hear the gentle sound of the wind.

<b>

"I'll say this only once."

<b>

From about 20 meters away, Shin spoke in a slightly louder voice. Without saying a word, I asked with my gaze, "What is it?"

<b>

"We trust your character. We trust your strength. We trust your skills."

<b>

Suddenly being praised like this is unexpected.

What are they trying to butter me up for at this point?

<b>

"Don't think that we, challenging you as underdogs, are the same as the ones you've seen before."

<b>

"......? Understood."

<b>

What is he talking about? I don't really get it, but I'll just nod for now.

<b>

Shin holds a sword, Laika has her fists ready, and Suzu stands a bit back, preparing her spear.

Taking a deep breath, Regulus's chest swells. As that motion catches my eye, I instinctively tightened my grip on the sword.

And――,

<b>

"――Begin!"

<b>

The exhibition match, which would conclude the martial arts tournament, began.

<b>

At the signal, Shin and Laika dashed towards me in unison.

As expected, the two are the front line, while Suzu seems to play the role of a skirmisher.

<b>

I thought Shin would be the first to jump in, but it was Laika who launched the first attack against me.

<b>

"Haah!"

<b>

With a battle cry, she aimed her fist at my throat.

From her movements, it was clear that her level had risen and her stats had increased.

<b>

"Nice."

<b>

It's simple, but a good movement without waste.

<b>

I dodged Laika's attack by turning sideways and grabbed her arm.

Then, as I crossed my arms to sweep her legs with my dulled sword, Laika jumped on the spot.

<b>

Did she sense the leg sweep? Not bad.

<b>

As I thought this condescendingly, she grabbed the arm I was holding with her other arm, curled up like a hedgehog in mid-air, and fell to the ground.

<b>

"――Whoa!"

<b>

If she does that, of course, I would lose my balance and fall forward. If it were against a monster, I would have been attacked from behind and killed, but this is a match――and a party battle at that.

Before I could deal with Laika――Suzu jumped in.

<b>

"That's weak. Is that all you've got?"

<b>

Her body was glowing red――it seemed she was using the sage skill "Body Enhancement."

This skill increases STR, VIT, and AGI stats at the cost of constant mana consumption. While it doesn't provide a drastic increase like going from D to C, it's a significant enhancement that can't be ignored.

<b>

She aimed her spear at my waist. The way she confidently targeted a hard-to-evade spot is impressive.

Even if she hit, the tip is dulled, so it wouldn't pierce but would leave a bruise.

<b>

As I deflected Suzu's attack with the sword in my right hand, I kicked towards her abdomen.

<b>

"――Guh!"

<b>

With a groan, Suzu rolled a few meters away. I didn't kick that hard, so it probably wouldn't cause much damage. It would be a problem if she went down here.

<b>

After the attack, before I could set my foot back on the ground, I sensed a strong presence from behind.

Quickly turning my body, I saw Shin with his arm raised.

<b>

"You know this skill, right?"

<b>

In his hand, there was no weapon――no, it was probably just invisible.

The skill "Phantom Sword," which can be acquired at level 40 for martial arts swordsmen, allows one to temporarily make their weapon transparent.

He swung the invisible sword down towards me. While the sword was invisible, it was easy to predict its trajectory just by watching his arm's movement.

<b>

I tried to block Shin's attack with my sword――but I couldn't.

<b>

"――Huh?"

<b>

His attack literally passed through me. Without giving any vibration to my sword, his hand came down.

<b>

――Could it be that he pretended to use the Phantom Sword but actually didn't have a sword at all...?

<b>

For just a moment, I was left dumbfounded, not understanding what was happening.

That gap was truly fatal.

<b>

"Don't underestimate Jinrai's trajectory too much."

<b>

With that line, a sharp impact hit my abdomen. I could tell without looking that I had been struck in the stomach with a sword. Moreover, the one who attacked was Laika, who had said she was not good with swords.

<b>

Since she was in a position with her back on the ground, it wouldn't be that much damage if she swung her sword seriously.

<b>

However, it was a wake-up call.

<b>

I quickly stepped on Laika's shoulder, managed to break free from her hold, and swiftly distanced myself from them.

<b>

As Laika said, I had underestimated them.

<b>

"I need to revise my perception..."

<b>

Jinrai's trajectory moves completely differently when facing monsters.

When you think about it, it's only natural. Losing while exploring a dungeon means death. Therefore, you have to maintain a sufficient safety margin.

<b>

I finally understood what Shin had meant before the match.

<b>

"We trust your skills."

<b>

In other words, ensuring their safety in this match is none other than my job as their opponent.

They trust that I won't accidentally cause them serious injury and are coming at me with all their strength. They've even mixed in some deception with their words to try to take me down.

<b>

That's a nice thing.

<b>

Following Sera's promise, Jinrai's trajectory is also saying they trust me.

<b>

"This is getting exciting."

<b>

It's only human to want to meet expectations, right?

<b>
