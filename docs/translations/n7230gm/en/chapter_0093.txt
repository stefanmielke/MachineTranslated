# 90 No Hope for the Future

It may look a bit like an explanation, but please forgive me...

<b>

"My name is Noah. You probably have a lot of questions, but I'm currently in a state where I'm really forcing myself to talk, so can you believe that we don't have much time?"

<b>

The girl who claimed to be a god named Noah snapped her fingers with a flowing motion. Then, between her and me, an inorganic, pure white table and two chairs appeared. She sat down in one of them.

<b>

"…How much time do you have to talk?"

<b>

I couldn't bring myself to sit across from her and instead stood there asking the question.

I didn't want to approach her carelessly, not knowing whether she was good or evil.

<b>

"Well... I think I can manage about ten minutes. After you conquer the S-rank dungeon, we can talk a lot more."

<b>

Ten minutes... that's short.

If that's the case, it would be a waste of time to ask if this brat is really a god, where this colorless space is, or how old she is.

<b>

I need to think hard and extract only the necessary information.

But before that.

<b>

"What do you know—Noah, how much do you know?"

<b>

I thought it was a bit rude to speak so arrogantly to a god, but I didn't feel like speaking politely to her.

<b>

When I asked, she leaned her elbows on the table, clasped her hands, and smiled confidently.

<b>

"I won't say I know everything, but I have enough knowledge to answer your questions. After all, I'm a god."

<b>

"…Is that so."

<b>

It was surprising enough to step into a fantasy world, but to think I would end up talking to a god... Life is unpredictable.

<b>

I took a deep breath and exhaled.

<b>

"You said Serah isn't gone, right? Where is she?"

<b>

"She's drifting in the space between time. Once our conversation is over, I'll transfer her along with you to the S-rank dungeon, so don't worry."

<b>

The space between time... that's truly fantasy.

Well, as long as she's safe, that's what matters.

<b>

"You previously said, 'If you defeat Venom, everything will return to normal,' right? Will the Phenons return to normal if they defeat Venom? Can this crazy world be fixed?"

<b>

"That's correct, but to be precise, it will be recreated. Your companions, the Phenons and Shiri, and everyone else who has disappeared will return to their original state. As long as Venom is gone... if I can regain my power, it's possible."

<b>

"I see."

<b>

Hearing that, I felt somewhat relieved.

If I can defeat Venom, everything will be resolved. There is hope.

<b>

"Is Venom the cause of this broken world?"

<b>

At that question, Noah furrowed her brow as if troubled and murmured, "Where should I start?" She was probably trying to summarize her explanation because there wasn't enough time to explain everything.

<b>

"First, the 'Demon King Venom' that you know from Tempest. That's not his real name. It's a false name just adapted for the game."

<b>

Noah took a breath and looked straight into my eyes.

<b>

"The correct name is 'God of Destruction Venom.' He is the opposite of me, the God of Creation. All the dungeons in this world are seals to confine the God of Destruction Venom. By conquering the dungeons, the seals are released."

<b>

Venom is the God of Destruction? The dungeons are... seals?

<b>

"Are you trying to make me defeat a god? And if it's a seal, wouldn't conquering it be a bad idea?"

<b>

"You have that much power. I've confirmed it within Tempest."

<b>

Saying that, she lifted me up and, while speaking a bit quickly, Noah explained the workings of this world, including the dungeons.

<b>

She said that the sealing by the dungeons is merely a way to buy time. If Venom is not defeated, there's nothing to do but wait for destruction.

<b>

She said that Venom can only destroy what I, Noah, have created. And it seems that Noah herself is in a state where half of her body has been destroyed by Venom.

<b>

She said that if the S-rank dungeon—meaning the last seal—is broken, all humans except for me will be erased by Venom.

<b>

<b>

"So that's why you manipulated the people of the royal castle to summon beings from another world who won't be erased by Venom..."

<b>

"I didn't manipulate them. I just guided things to turn out that way."

<b>

"That's pretty much the same thing."

<b>

And I couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.

I realized that I was probably one of the people being manipulated by her. I understood that I had been given this to be taken away.

<b>

"Your methods are the worst. You made me spend a year here on purpose to make me grow attached to this world."

<b>

"…That's right. It's a contract that allows you to return to your original world if you truly wish to 'go home.' I made sure you wouldn't feel that way."

<b>

"A contract? With whom?"

<b>

"With the God of Creation of Earth."

<b>

Was there really a God of Creation on Earth...?

I had a vague feeling that there were many gods in mythological stories, but...

<b>

No, this is getting off track.

In fact, there was too much information, and my head was starting to get confused. I regretted not taking notes while listening.

<b>

It had probably been nearly ten minutes since I started talking to her.

I still had a mountain of questions, but I would use the remaining time for final confirmations.

<b>

"So, in short, I just need to conquer the S-rank dungeon and defeat Venom, right?"

<b>

If that's the case, it's the development I had anticipated from the start.

Even after hearing Noah's story, what I need to do hasn't changed. Defeat Venom and return the world to its original form.

<b>

"Yes. After conquering the S-rank dungeon, Venom's influence on this world will expand. I will also give up on protecting this world, so I will do my best to support you."

<b>

"Protecting means... are you still protecting Serah and the others from Venom?"

<b>

"That's right. If you think you don't need it, I can stop protecting them right away."

<b>

"…No, please don't."

<b>

At the very least, I want to talk to Serah one last time. I want to make a promise to reunite.

<b>

Noah nodded at my words, her expression sad as she furrowed her brows and opened her mouth, only to close it again—repeating that several times. For some reason, she seemed to be reflecting on the words "promise to reunite" that I had just thought of.

<b>

And then,

<b>

"I have something I must tell you. I thought about not saying it, but it wouldn't be fair."

<b>

With a tearful expression, she said that, and I, feeling a bit anxious, asked, "What is it?"

<b>

Noah kept her gaze on the table and spoke in a murmuring tone.

<b>

"The world destroyed by Venom becomes zero once. When creating a new world, a 'world without consistency' cannot be created structurally. When it is in a state destroyed by the God of Destruction, it is somewhat permissible."

<b>

"…? You mean a world that ignores physical laws can't be created, or something like that?"

<b>

"That's right. You could say a world without contradictions."

<b>

"Well, that makes sense. But what does that mean?"

<b>

As I voiced my doubts, Noah bit her lip tightly.

It was so painful to watch that I felt my own face twitch.

<b>

"You are... not a soul I created. You can only be inserted into the world I created afterward."

<b>

My heart skipped a beat.

The worst future flashed through my mind.

<b>

"I cannot inscribe a history of you in the world I create."

<b>

The blood drained from my face.

I couldn't even tell if I was standing, lying down, awake, or asleep; everything felt hazy.

<b>

<b>

"I cannot create a person who has your memories."

<b>
