# 110 Fallen God, New World

<b>

<b>

<b>

It's a bit different from waking up. Is it correct to say it’s like the fog clearing?

In any case, I awakened my consciousness in a new world.

<b>

This isn’t the starting point when beginning a game, nor is it the royal castle I visited when I was reincarnated into this world. It was a grassy plain that could be found anywhere.

Lying flat, I looked up at the sky. Just like looking up at the sky in the countryside of Earth, I could see several small stars twinkling.

<b>

“……Speaking of which, I heard about the timing, but I didn’t ask about the time zone or location of my reincarnation.”

<b>

Without moving my body from that position, I muttered absentmindedly.

<b>

I tilted my face to the right to see if there was any building that could serve as a landmark, but it was pitch dark and I couldn’t see anything.

It might be a consideration from Ideya-sama to avoid being seen, but where the hell am I? I just got my world back, and starting off lost is not what I want. It would be no joke if I died out here without finding a town.

<b>

“My inventory is still the same, huh…”

<b>

As I lay there, I checked my items on the window screen, and the contents were the same as just before defeating Venom.

Upon closer inspection, all the equipment I was wearing was also as good as new. This must have been done by Ideya-sama or Noah. Thank you very much.

<b>

As I was thinking about such things,

<b>

“――There’s no need for thanks, Savior-kun.”

<b>

Suddenly, without any warning.

I heard the voice that I had been hearing incessantly lately, to the point of annoyance.

<b>

Looking in the direction of the voice――when I looked up, there was an upside-down face. It was hard to tell because it was facing the other way, but it was probably smiling. Standing next to my head, it was looking down at me.

<b>

“Is it really okay for a god to just show up here so easily? …And stop calling me that.”

<b>

“Would you prefer ‘Hero’ instead?”

<b>

“Please stop that too. Just call me SR normally.”

<b>

“Ahaha, I was just joking. SR-kun.”

<b>

With a big smile, Noah said cheerfully.

Even in this empty world where it was just the two of us, she was showing her smile, but seeing her smile again made me realize that the smile she had back then was probably forced.

Her skin, which had been discolored by Venom, seemed to be completely beautiful again.

<b>

Her outfit had also changed a bit, and instead of the dress or feathered clothing she used to wear, she was now in a tartan check skirt and a shirt――it was simple and didn’t look godlike at all.

<b>

No matter how her outfit changed, it felt like “do as you please,” but there was a slight problem at this point.

<b>

<b>

To put it simply, her panties were――completely visible.

<b>

<b>

It seemed that her outfit was age-appropriate for her body type. However, the panties were black lace, with floral patterns drawn in varying shades of transparency, and the edges had a slight frill. She should have at least worn something like bear-patterned panties.

<b>

And even though she is a god, I would like her to have a bit of modesty since she is in the form of a girl.

<b>

“――What are you staring at! SR-kun, you pervert!”

<b>

Did she read my mind――or did she notice my gaze? Noah’s face turned bright red as she pressed her hands against her skirt and took a step back from me.

<b>

“It’s your fault for standing there. Don’t worry, I’m not interested in kids.”

<b>

“I’m far older than you humans!”

<b>

“Then you’re an old lady.”

<b>

“This body is twelve years old!”

<b>

“Then you’re still a kid.”

<b>

In response to my reply, Noah puffed out her cheeks, showing her dissatisfaction.

She has really started to show a lot of expression. How nice, how nice.

<b>

Not nice at all! Noah protested, and I casually brushed her off as I sat up.

Then, as I looked around again, I spotted two dungeons in the distance. Additionally, I could see a house relatively close by.

<b>

Since orange light was leaking from the window, it was certain that there were people inside.

<b>

“…………Huh? Is this place……?”

<b>

Upon closer inspection, the layout of these dungeons――and the house. It looked very familiar.

It’s possible that it’s just similar――but nine times out of ten, this place is near Renas, and the dungeons in sight are a B-rank dungeon and an A-rank dungeon.

<b>

However, the world should have been rolled back to before I was summoned, so why is there a house built in that location?

Could it be that someone with thoughts similar to mine appeared and built a house?

<b>

As I stared intently in the direction of the house, a proud Noah puffed out her chest.

<b>

“That’s my house.”

<b>

……Huh?

<b>

“No, no, that’s strange. Why is a god like you building a house on the surface?”

<b>

“I decided to live here for a while. Didn’t Ideya-sama tell you anything?”

<b>

“Hmm? Ah, now that you mention it, Ideya-sama did say she would manage this world for a while.”

<b>

Could it be like Noah’s recovery period? I don’t know.

<b>

“So what are you going to do now that you’re unemployed?”

<b>

“Don’t call me unemployed!! I said I would live here!”

<b>

“Live here――like us humans?”

<b>

“Yeah. I’ve been living here for about a year, and surprisingly, human life is fun.”

<b>

Noah said, shaking her body cheerfully.

Come to think of it, a year has already passed in this new world.

I want to see Sera, Phenon, and the others from the Lightning Trail soon, but it’s already late today.

For now, I should sleep and think about what comes next tomorrow. There are things I want to ask Noah about this reborn world too.

<b>

“So let me sleep in that house. It’s a hassle to stay at an inn in town right now.”

<b>

“That’s a bit rude…… but of course, your room is ready.”

<b>

Oh, so that was your intention from the start. You should have said that earlier.

As I stood up and started walking toward the house, Noah came beside me, pouting her lips. However, that expression quickly changed to one of joy.

<b>

“Have you checked your status yet?”

<b>

Peering up at my face from a diagonal angle, Noah asked.

<b>

“Huh? Has something changed? ―Wait… seriously?”

<b>

I involuntarily stopped in my tracks.

The status displayed in the air showed “Level 1,” followed by the words “Job Not Selected.”

<b>

What the…… Am I starting over again? I do like leveling up, but by the third time, it’s starting to get tedious.

<b>

“Don’t worry, you’re just temporarily unemployed. Try displaying your job.”

<b>

With my face still twitching, I touched the job section as Noah instructed.

Then, of course, the primary jobs that are displayed by default from the start, as well as secondary jobs, derived secondary jobs, and tertiary jobs were shown.

<b>

Moreover, the displayed jobs were not limited to just those.

<b>

“……Overlord, huh.”

<b>

Below the tertiary jobs, the words “Overlord,” said to be the elusive fourth job, floated into view.

After defeating Venom in the game a few years ago――I can finally get the job I’ve longed for.

<b>

“This world――I haven’t given it a specific name, so I simply call it the ‘VR World,’ but it’s a special job just for you, the only one in the VR World. Normally, you would need to max out all jobs, but this time it’s special.”

<b>

“Couldn’t you at least decide on a name for the world? …And isn’t it unfair that it’s a job just for me?”

<b>

If it were a completely unknown world, that would be one thing, but cheating in a world modeled after Tempest is not what I want.

<b>

“It’s not that you can’t change jobs. If you can defeat me, you’ll be able to change to Overlord.”

<b>

“I’m in the Venom position, huh.”

<b>

“Hahaha, it might be something similar.”

<b>

Seeing me look dejected, Noah laughed happily.

<b>

As we were talking, we had somehow arrived in front of the house.

Since Noah didn’t say anything in particular, I opened the front door with the same feeling I had when returning to my own house.

<b>

Then, for some reason, I heard the sound of pattering footsteps coming from inside the house. The footsteps were gradually getting louder.

<b>

“Eh?”

<b>

In a panic, I looked at Noah beside me, and she was covering her mouth and laughing.

When our eyes met, she opened her mouth while trying to hold back her laughter.

<b>

“I said ‘my house’ earlier, but to be precise, it’s ‘our house.’”

<b>

“Huh!? You didn’t tell me that!? What the hell――”

<b>

I tried to continue my words, but I couldn’t. My thoughts and emotions were completely unable to keep up with the situation.

That was because the person who appeared from inside the house was someone I had wished to meet over and over again.

<b>

Sera Bernot.

The important person who had forgotten about me.

<b>

The loungewear she was wearing looked just like what I had seen before.

She was staring at me with a blank expression. That somewhat foolish-looking expression was incredibly endearing.

<b>

However, to her now, I was a complete stranger. If I were to get sentimental and start crying, I might be labeled as a suspicious person.

<b>

“Um, I’m sorry for coming in suddenly at night.”

<b>

I thought I had prepared my heart long ago, but it was still sad.

Using polite language made it feel like a wall had been built between her and me.

<b>

“I’m an acquaintance of Noah, and I just happened to—‘SR!!’”

<b>

While I was talking, I was suddenly hugged from the front.

The force was so strong that I almost fell over, but I managed to brace myself and maintain my stance.

<b>

“……Huh?”

<b>

What is this girl doing?

I didn’t think she had a personality that would suddenly hug a stranger!? What happened during that year!?

<b>

Panic panic!

Thought process error error!

<b>

The soft, feminine sensation enveloped my body, and a sweet scent wafted from her neck. She wrapped her arms around my back and seemed to be gripping my clothes tightly.

<b>

I seriously don’t understand. What is going on in this situation――wait… huh?

<b>

…………Huh?

<b>

………………Huh?

<b>

<b>

Didn’t Sera just call my name?
