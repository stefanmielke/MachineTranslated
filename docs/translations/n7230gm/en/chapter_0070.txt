# 67 What Kind of House Should We Build?

<b>

<b>

<b>

We returned to the duke's residence and immediately went to negotiate with Duke Margus to obtain permission to build a house outside the city.

<b>

I don't think there are detailed laws like building codes in this world, but there are hardly any buildings outside the city except near dungeons, so it's certainly not common. There must be some kind of regulations in place.

<b>

However, that concern turned out to be unfounded.

<b>

I thought there might be some hesitation or twists and turns, but Lord Drag readily agreed and even suggested lending us some guards.

It seems that the matter of the elixir is still on his mind. If Lord Drag hadn't looked apologetic, I would have completely forgotten about it.

<b>

<b>

"Since Mr. Lorenz is calling the contractors, let's gather everyone's requests lightly until then."

<b>

I borrowed the reception room from Lord Drag and said this to the three party members.

<b>

I have a rough idea of their general hopes, but we haven't discussed the details.

It would be troublesome if we ended up arguing about what we like and dislike when it comes time to decide on the layout.

<b>

I'll leave the kitchen space to Shiri and Sera, who will be cooking, but what I want to mention is the bath! And the size of the building!

<b>

Maybe it's because I grew up in a typical Japanese household, but I've realized that I feel uneasy in overly spacious living areas.

Of course, not all houses in this world are large; I think it's limited to places where wealthy families like the royal castle and the duke's residence live. However, Sera and I possess a considerable amount of wealth, and Fenon is even a member of the royal family.

<b>

If I don't clearly state here that "the house should be small!", I feel like a ridiculously large house will end up being built.

<b>

"I want a larger bath made of fragrant wood. Also, let's minimize rooms with unclear purposes. And I want my room to be small."

<b>

I immediately took the lead in expressing my requests.

Sera and Fenon listened to me while nodding, and Shiri was taking notes, softly repeating my words.

<b>

"We need rooms for the four of us, a living room, a dining room, and two guest bedrooms should be enough."

<b>

Since the only guests will probably be the likes of Thunderbolt's Trail. If we can separate their rooms by gender, there shouldn't be any issues.

<b>

When I said that, Fenon eagerly raised her hand, sparkling with excitement as if asking for permission to speak.

I’m not the one moderating the discussion, so she can freely express her opinions.

<b>

"What is it, Fenon?"

<b>

"Isn't my bedroom going to be shared with SR-san?"

<b>

"Ugh—! O-of course, it will be separate! Fenon is a proper member of the royal family, and you shouldn't so easily think about sleeping in the same room with a man!"

<b>

I ended up speaking in a tone reminiscent of lecturing a child. I might be flustered.

<b>

"If it were any other man, I would certainly refuse, but this is a matter between SR-san and me."

<b>

With an expression that seemed to say, "So it's not a problem, right?" Fenon said.

It’s a huge problem, you fool. Think about your position before you speak.

<b>

As I grimaced at the princess's forward statement, unexpected help arrived from an unlikely source. Her long-time friend—Sera.

<b>

"Fenon. You are a princess who has not yet entered into marriage, right? Even if nothing happens, saying you want to sleep in the same bed is essentially asking for 'responsibility.' You should consider SR's feelings as well."

<b>

Sera spoke in a calm tone, as if advising her daughter.

Even though they are close friends, she properly points out what is wrong—there are probably only a handful of people in this world who could say such things to the first princess.

<b>

She has a solid side to her—though I was only impressed for a moment.

<b>

"So, I will sleep in the room next to SR."

<b>

"—Huh?"

<b>

I couldn't see the connection in her statement and involuntarily asked for clarification. I hope I didn't mishear that.

When I looked at Sera, she was nervously avoiding my gaze. For some reason, she had a grin on her face.

<b>

"W-well, I am SR's former apprentice. I might have various questions about fighting and dungeon exploration, so it would be more convenient to be in the next room. I might come into SR's room and ask questions late into the night—if I've had a drink, there's a possibility I might just fall asleep! It could happen to be on SR's bed—though you don't have to worry about that!"

<b>

...... 

<b>

...... Yeah.

<b>

I understood the content.

<b>

That's fine, but why are you speaking so fast? It took me a while to sort it out in my head. Besides, if you ask questions while drinking, you'll probably forget everything the next day anyway.

<b>

"I'll sleep in the guest room then. Don't come complaining later that the bed smelled."

<b>

I think my current body is young enough to handle it, but back in Japan, I was at the age where I started to worry about body odor. If someone said it smelled, I would definitely end up crying into my pillow that night.

<b>

"—Ah, well, yeah..."

<b>

Upon hearing my response, Sera immediately lost her momentum and shrank back. She's quite the emotional rollercoaster.

Perhaps she was also thinking of sleeping with me, just like Fenon?

<b>

I imagined such a thing, but my history of being unpopular immediately dismissed that possibility.

The princess certainly seems to have feelings for me, thanks to the "life-saving benefactor effect," but I haven't done anything special for Sera—at least, I feel that way.

I did give her a ring, but that's just equipment.

<b>

In the end, my room ended up being positioned between Fenon and Sera, but now the discussion about where to place my bed began—without me.

<b>

It doesn't matter where the bed goes... why do you all have such serious expressions deciding the position of someone else's bed? And why am I not part of that discussion?

<b>

As I sighed and watched the two of them argue, Shiri, who had been maintaining a bystander stance, timidly raised her hand and said, "Um."

<b>

Please don't tell me she wants to say she prefers to be near my room...?

Thinking that, I nervously asked, "What is it?" Fenon and Sera also stopped their conversation and turned their attention to Shiri.

<b>

"We haven't made any progress on the bedrooms at all... the contractors will be arriving soon, you know?"

<b>

<b>

"「「「Ah」」」"
