# A-112 Reunion

<b>

<b>

<b>

The攻略 of S-rank dungeons is still not common in this world.

<b>

We started with the exploration of Lindale, then visited Palmour and Rezel to攻略 in the same manner, but the number of clearers for S-rank dungeons is still around ten people in the world.

<b>

Well, anyway, the people around me, including myself, have a different level of status compared to others.

Of course, in practical terms, Shiri and Fenon still fall short of the seasoned veterans, but they can make up for that gap with their status.

<b>

Perhaps because of that, we were treated with incredible courtesy in the Fema Kingdom, which we were assigned to.

<b>

Although it cannot be said that the power of titles like the First Princess and the daughter of a Count's family had no effect at all, we were respected primarily as 'ASR', the conquerors of S-rank dungeons.

<b>

It seems that this is a result of time passing since we first conquered an S-rank dungeon, and the strength of those around me, including myself, becoming known to other countries.

I thought the Fema Kingdom was special, but when I inquired through communication, it seemed that Crescent and Jade received similar welcomes. They had shown their prowess in conquering dungeons in Rezel.

<b>

Now, back to the main topic.

<b>

Our current objective is the攻略 of the S-rank dungeon—rather, the resurrection of my parents and having Lady Idea create a new dungeon in this world.

<b>

We spent less than half a day sightseeing in the Fema Kingdom, greeted their kings,攻略ed, shared information, and immediately returned to Lindale.

<b>

"There's no need to rush that much..."

<b>

Seeing me complete the mission in almost the shortest schedule, Lady Idea had a look of exasperation on her face.

The location is my own room, and I am the only one here. In another place, Crescent and the others, who had also conquered S-rank dungeons, returned to Lindale about half a day later than us.

<b>

They had攻略ed two dungeons, but since they were closer to Lindale, the timing was just right.

Right now, the other ASR members and the two from Earth, the members of the Lightning Trails, are in the living room on the first floor. They seem to be considerate of me, who is about to meet my parents.

<b>

"Well... Fema is far away, and I thought about taking my time since it’s a rare opportunity, but I just couldn’t seem to relax and enjoy the sightseeing, so I decided to finish this first."

<b>

I respond to Lady Idea like that.

After all, in a situation where I could reunite with my parents by asking Lady Idea, it wouldn't be easy to simply enjoy an unfamiliar city, right? It seems that Sera and the others understood that as well—if anything, they seemed to think, 'Are you curious about the new dungeon?'

<b>

Yeah... that's a big factor. Quite a lot.

<b>

"Well then... let us first reincarnate your parents into this world—both of them were delighted to hear they could meet you and wished for reincarnation. Now, here we go."

<b>

"—! P-please!"

<b>

Lady Idea was abrupt.

<b>

Well, I can't tell a god to "read the atmosphere and mimic human conversation," nor do I intend to. Although she is sitting on my bed as if it were her own, I have no intention of reprimanding her.

<b>

After all, she is a goddess. A god who can bring the dead back to life.

I understood that I had been reincarnated, but when it comes to actually meeting my parents, I truly realize how she is an existence beyond our power.

<b>

Well, she is approachable, including Noah, though.

<b>

With her index finger pointed straight, Lady Idea quickly moves that finger. It looked like a mechanical movement that would be impossible for a human body. A faint purple light appeared where her finger traced. The light, resembling a geometric pattern magic circle, moved about a meter away from her fingertip.

<b>

Then it grew large, quickly becoming about two meters in diameter, floating close to the ceiling. It then began to slowly move downward.

<b>

"Wow..."

<b>

I can use magic in this world, but... this is what you call free magic. It feels like magic created from scratch, unconstrained by the concept of skills. This must be what true magic is.

<b>

As the magic circle descended, first, I saw hair. It was at a height of about one hundred eighty centimeters, taller than me—familiar hair.

<b>

Forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, and one by one, they came into view. The owner of the face, looking younger than I remembered, smiled happily when our eyes met. It’s a secret that I thought I should at least shed a tear of emotion at such a moment.

<b>

Well, that’s my dad. He must have received an explanation from Lady Idea regarding my changed appearance. He didn’t seem surprised.

<b>

And right next to my dad, I saw lustrous hair.

Her height was about one hundred sixty centimeters—during her lifetime, people often said her eyes resembled mine. Unfortunately, since I have taken on a game body now, that commonality has disappeared.

<b>

"They both look just like they did on Earth."

<b>

As my first words, I addressed them, and both of them smiled in unison. A similar, sly smile.

<b>

"Well, Shuu has changed quite a bit. But you’re still our son."

<b>

"Hey, hey, Shuu-chan! We turned twenty-five! Lady Idea is the best!"

<b>

As the magic circle descended fully, they approached me while speaking.

Wait... twenty-five? They look almost the same as me now. This is incredible.

As I hesitated about which one to respond to first,

<b>

"By the way, I heard you saved the world? Nice job."

<b>

"More importantly, you have a wife, Shuu-chan! And she's a princess and a noble! Just like our son!"

<b>

"I heard that little girl who was originally a goddess is also interested in you."

<b>

"Oh, isn't she the one who's interested in Shuu-chan?"

<b>

"Was it? Anyway, it seems like you have a harem now. Nice going, huh?"

<b>

"You can't, you know?"

<b>

"Of course not, I only have eyes for you."

<b>

Saying that, they gazed into each other's eyes right in front of me.

<b>

...Is this a touching reunion? From what they said, it seems they have been hearing bits and pieces about my activities from Lady Idea or watching them like a video, so maybe that’s why the emotion feels a bit diminished... but still, isn’t this a bit much?

<b>

Lady Idea also cast a sympathetic glance at me. It makes sense.

Maybe I should just leave these two and head to the living room—while sighing, I thought that, and then they both looked at me simultaneously, grinning.

<b>

"Don't be so angry, it’s just a joke! I’m embarrassed too."

<b>

"Welcome back, Shuu-chan. You did well all by yourself."

<b>

"Ah, you did great. Shuu is our pride and joy."

<b>

Saying that, they both hugged me at the same time. I felt like pushing them away, but... well, I guess I’ll endure it here.

<b>

...Thinking like this is probably just my way of hiding my embarrassment.

<b>

"Welcome back, Dad, Mom."

<b>

After a long time—truly a long time, I found myself crying in front of my parents.
