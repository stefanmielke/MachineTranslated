# 47 Growth

<b>

<b>

<b>

There are 15 days left until the martial arts tournament held in the royal capital.

<b>

The four of us have been making sure to clear the B-rank dungeon twice every day since the day after Raileth-san gave us permission. However, we have yet to obtain the desired drop items.

I understand that they are not easy to obtain, but I would like at least one drop before the tournament. It seems that things don't go that smoothly after all.

<b>

However, just because there are no rare drops doesn't mean our results are zero.

<b>

I remain unscathed in battle, and even if Sera gets injured, Fenon-san's 'Heal' is sufficient for recovery, so the advanced potions from boss drops keep accumulating.

Moreover, the levels of the party members are gradually increasing, so the results of our dungeon explorations are indeed showing.

<b>

With the addition of the custom-made equipment prepared by Drag-sama, I can say that our party's combat strength has been significantly enhanced.

<b>

<b>

First, Shiri-san.

<b>

She has raised the level of all primary jobs to 30 and is currently working on leveling up her magic archer. In a few days, she will reach a point where she can gain the player bonus, so she will transition to leveling up other secondary jobs.

She has new boots that go up to her thighs and a black jacket, but honestly, her appearance hasn't changed much.

She still sports her usual midriff-baring style—it's a sight for sore eyes.

<b>

<b>

Next is Fenon-san.

<b>

To alleviate my anxiety about any potential emergencies and considering her role within the party, I decided to prioritize her defense training. In other words, strengthening her VIT and MND.

That said, since we can't raise her MND immediately, I had her focus on increasing her VIT as a heavy knight and barrier mage. She has finished leveling her heavy knight to 30 and is now working on her barrier mage.

She received an inner garment with magic resistance from Drag-sama, so like Shiri-san, there is no change in her appearance. I assume it was taken into consideration that she is in disguise.

<b>

<b>

And then there's Sera.

<b>

Like Fenon-san and me, she is leveling up her secondary job, and the other day she reached level 30 as a martial swordsman, so now she is leveling up as a divine archer. Of course, she fights with her familiar sword instead of using a bow at all.

<b>

Her chest armor and other equipment have been removed, and she is wearing a wine-colored Napoleon jacket on top. For some reason, she also had a skirt that was about 20 centimeters above her knees.

Isn't her defense—or rather, her guard—getting a bit thin? She seems to be wearing something like leggings underneath, so there’s no worry about her underwear being visible, but as someone who fights on the front lines, what’s up with that?

<b>

—As I was pondering this, it turned out to be Fenon-san's suggestion.

Sera seemed to be quite pleased with it, so I told her, "It suits you." Her ears quickly turned red, so she was probably embarrassed.

Apparently, she is wearing knee-high socks that serve a defensive role, but I hope she remains cautious about injuries. Women's obsession with fashion is truly terrifying.

<b>

<b>

I have leveled up to 30 as a brawler's advanced class, the mighty, and now I am also a divine archer like Sera.

Even though I don’t have a bow in my inventory, it’s not unusual in Tempest. It’s more enjoyable and stronger to fight in my area of expertise.

<b>

The equipment Drag-sama prepared for me resembles a Chinese outfit for men. It looks like something out of a kung fu movie.

The color scheme is monochrome, with black on the bottom and white on top. The pants are designed to be loose, while the top is fitted enough not to hinder combat.

Though it’s made of fabric, it seems to have cutting resistance and some magical resistance. From its texture and performance, it appears to be quite a high-quality item.

<b>

With new equipment and an increased job level.

It won’t be long before we can fight together as a team rather than relying on individual brute force like we are now.

<b>

Our party is steadily growing.

<b>

There is one person whose growth is extraordinary, but… just how far can she go?

Previously, I felt anger when Sera called it "talent," but I couldn't think of a better word to describe her abilities.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"To think Sera-sama has come this far—n-no! Of course, I knew she was excellent as an explorer from the start, but…"

<b>

"I understand what you want to say, Shiri. I also didn't expect Sera to become this strong."

<b>

In the second layer of the B-rank dungeon in Reinas.

<b>

Initially, I had entrusted Sera with only the first layer, while I handled the rest, but a few days ago, I decided to let her take on the second layer as well.

<b>

Sera seemed delighted that my decision recognized her abilities, to the point where I felt a bit taken aback and said, "O-oh... that's great."

It's nice that she's happy, but she doesn't need to hug me. I wish she would consider that I'm not used to the unique softness that women possess.

<b>

Out of Sera's line of sight, Fenon-san was secretly doing a fist pump, likely because it meant more time for me to talk to her.

I want to ask if she feels nothing about her friend hugging her crush—but since romance is not my strong suit, I decided to let things unfold as they may.

I can't believe it, but could it be that Fenon-san was fist-pumping at the act of "Sera hugging me"—that would be too strange.

<b>

"She has become stronger—though I won't say it's solely thanks to my guidance, her growth rate is impressive."

<b>

I noticed her unique qualities about three days into our exploration of the Reinas dungeon. It struck me while she was fighting a golem kong.

<b>

Now that I think about it—I haven't had to give her the same advice even once.

<b>

She follows what I said the first time perfectly.

In daily life, there are times when I think, "Is Sera perhaps a bit foolish?" but in combat, she is nothing short of exceptional.

Despite the rapidly changing battle conditions, she never forgot my advice.

<b>

She doesn't make the same mistake twice.

<b>

It sounds easy to say, but in reality—especially in combat, executing that is quite difficult.

<b>

Sera transformed all 30 sand wolves in the second layer into particles and walked over with a satisfied expression.

<b>

"I’m done. Sorry to keep you waiting."

<b>

First, Fenon and Shiri-san offered their words of encouragement, saying, "Good job" and "Thank you for your hard work."

After Sera expressed her gratitude to them, she turned to me. I also raised my hand lightly and said, "Good work."

<b>

"Was there any area for improvement? If so, please let me know."

<b>

"Hmm… I didn't see any particular problems this time, so when we dive next, let's try to diversify our fighting styles. It’s fine against monsters if it's one pattern, but in human combat, it will be quickly countered."

<b>

From an outsider's perspective, there are likely many differences between me and her, but since I have never fought while looking in a mirror or recorded combat scenes, I find it difficult to provide further advice based solely on her current fighting style.

<b>

"That’s certainly true… understood. Then I’ll leave the remaining layers to you."

<b>

"Yeah, take your time to rest."

<b>

When I said that, she smirked and said,

<b>

"If you get tired, just let me know anytime, and I’ll take over without hesitation."

<b>

She said that confidently.

<b>

She has become quite reliable. Moreover, I feel like she has returned a bit to her former energetic self.

However, I won't let her take away my enjoyment.

<b>

"—Hah, there's no way I would get tired from this. Even if I were tired, I wouldn't let you take over."

<b>

All the monsters that appear from here on are my prey. Even if it's Sera, I won't allow her to interfere.
