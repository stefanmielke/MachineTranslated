# A-42 The Apostle of God?

<b>

<b>

<b>

Has it been about two hours since the match started?

I'm not sure if my internal clock feels longer or shorter than it actually is, so I don't know which way to correct it.

<b>

If I'm having fun, it should feel shorter, but in this situation where one wrong step could lead me to cross the River Styx, it wouldn't be surprising if it feels longer. Well, it doesn't really matter how many hours have passed anyway.

<b>

In the first place, this isn't the time to be thinking about time.

<b>

"---Hah"

<b>

As I exhale sharply, I dodge the sword saint's sword strikes while cutting at the opponent's ankle.

<b>

Despite being humanoid in silhouette, no red blood flows from the wound. It's pointless to seek something realistic in this fantasy-filled world.

However, it seems to be in pain, and it's certain that it's taking damage... but it still feels strange. It's like cutting through hard rubber.

<b>

"Here we go---"

<b>

The words I once conveyed to Sera, "Don't defeat them, just deal damage."

<b>

As a mentor, I'm properly demonstrating that kind of fighting. There's a fundamental reason I don't have means to defeat them in one blow... but even if I could, I can't let my guard down. My tactics remain unchanged.

<b>

"Alright"

<b>

Lowering my stance, I dash along the ground, pursuing the enemy's ankle illuminated by the white light from the effect of Shiran. Attacking the same spot within three seconds—just this alone triples the damage, making it incredibly effective and efficient if we disregard the difficulty.

Immediately after dealing damage to the sword saint, an arrow shot by the spirit archer came flying towards my heart, but unfortunately—it's clearly visible, just as I expected, and such a transparent attack plays right into my hands.

<b>

The spot where I and the sword saint were, and the exact midpoint with the spirit archer. I kick the ground with force towards that location.

Then, if I just slightly alter the trajectory of the arrow shot by the enemy at this position—there's no need to look back to confirm. It should be piercing into the abdomen of the sword saint, who has an injured leg.

<b>

While doing that, another sword saint approached me, trying to prevent me from getting closer to the spirit archer while using the Kairiken to keep me at bay.

Oh, oh, getting anxious, huh? It seems like Lady Idea has packed in some high-performance AI.

Since the spirit archer isn't suited for close combat, they're trying to distance themselves from me, while the other sword saint is being healed by the saint. So, the one who will move next is—

<b>

"You’re coming, aren’t you?!"

<b>

The demon lord, who activated body enhancement while deploying gravity magic to block my retreat from the sword saint, came charging. Even without seeing their expression, I somehow felt that they were irritated.

<b>

Good, good—keep attacking. My counterattacks shine the brightest when the enemy is aggressive!

<b>

Despite being still young, the party member of Phenon with incredible power... is his brother.

He has a good personality and is trusted by his companions, and I've heard that he has a strong reputation among the heroes known as the Thunder's Trail, including Regulus, the guild master of the royal capital.

<b>

However, his abilities aren't particularly noteworthy, and I had received reports that his main job is doing menial tasks—but—

<b>

"Not only did he conquer an S-rank dungeon all by himself... but from the divine revelation, it seems he has connections with the creator god, Lady Idea. It would be more believable if they said he was dreaming."

<b>

As I watched the myth-like battle unfolding before me, I let out a half-sigh as I spoke those words, and Dino, who was standing next to me, replied, "Indeed."

<b>

"At the very least, it's certain that Lord Esuar was hiding his true strength... I don't know the reason, though. Still, with an unknown profession and unknown skills—I'm very curious, but it would be difficult to pry that information out. To oppose him would be nothing short of foolish."

<b>

"That's true, no need to even say it."

<b>

"Besides, there's also the possibility that he is the Apostle of God. If any nobles complain, I would want to tell them to know their place."

<b>

Dino said with gestures of exasperation. Seeing his demeanor, which seemed to reveal the stress he usually hides, made me involuntarily laugh out loud.

<b>

"Ha ha ha! I'm sorry for the trouble. However, I thought Lord Esuar would need achievements worthy of being Phenon's husband... but the roles have reversed in an instant. Is it really okay for me to stand next to him just because I'm a princess?"

<b>

From Phenon's usual demeanor, it's clear that she has feelings for Lord Esuar

If I were to meddle and arrange a marriage without permission, I would be hated by my daughter for life. Worst case, she might even run away from the kingdom. I never intended to do such a thing.

If she, who spent most of her days in bed due to poor health and could have lost her life, can find happiness, then as a father, I want to support her as much as I can. That's what I think... but is it really okay?

<b>

"I think it would be fine. Above all, he—Lord Esuar himself seemed to want that—ah, it's likely that Count Bernot's Sera and the maid Shiri will also marry him. Worrying about his capability is a waste of time."

<b>

"…I’m troubled about how to interact with him moving forward."

<b>

Should I kneel before him, predicting that he is the Apostle of God?

Or should I treat him as an equal king, considering his profession as a conqueror?

Or should I maintain a dignified stance as a king of a nation and as Phenon's father?

<b>

"From what we've discussed so far, I believe Lord Esuar would prefer to be treated normally."

<b>

"I see. …First, let's watch this battle. I'll think about it later."

<b>

Surely, the foreigners called to this place are also troubled, each for their own reasons, just like me.

His presence is far too influential. And his battles are far too detached from common sense.

<b>

"Soon, it will reach a conclusion."

<b>

Which side is in the lead? It must be clear to everyone by now.

What seemed to be a match where both sides' powers were balanced began to shift into one where one side started to overwhelm everything.

<b>

It was truly a battle worthy of the name of a conqueror.
