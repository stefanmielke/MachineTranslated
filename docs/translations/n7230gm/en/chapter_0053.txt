# 51 Anxiety

<b>

<b>

<b>

The arena in the royal capital of Lindale.

I used to visit this place almost as often as the dungeon. Of course, this is a story from the game era.

It hasn't changed much in appearance, so I don't feel a sense of freshness.

<b>

In the center of the bowl-shaped audience seating, there is a circular stage paved with stone, about 50 meters in diameter. This shape, resembling the Roman Colosseum, has become a standard for arenas appearing in games.

<b>

This arena can accommodate tens of thousands of spectators, and of course, its main purpose is PVP.

Using it for the purpose of showcasing to an audience, like this time, was something that never happened when I was playing the game. There were times when it was used for announcements of events by the management, but those were held without an audience.

<b>

I have probably only come to the arena as a spectator two or three times.

<b>

That's because when I was playing the Tempest game, I could watch PVP live broadcasts from the menu screen. Unfortunately, that feature is no longer available, but watching it live is definitely more immersive.

I didn't watch directly much because I dislike crowds, but I feel that there were fewer players who preferred the live broadcast.

<b>

Really, it's nostalgic... It's been a few months since I came to the arena, hasn't it?

I believe my last PVP ranking was 9th.

<b>

"If I hadn't been distracted by that magic, I would have won..."

<b>

Thinking back to the match made me feel irritated.

Even though there was a handicap, a loss is a loss. It's too frustrating.

<b>

"What's wrong, Master?"

<b>

"Ah, sorry. Just talking to myself."

<b>

In response to my answer, Sera, who was sitting next to me, tilted her head with a suspicious expression, but she didn't seem to intend to pursue it and returned her gaze to the match venue.

<b>

By the way, this 9th place.

I had stopped participating in individual matches because they were boring, so this ranking is from party matches.

<b>

The upper limit for party matches is the same as for dungeons, which is five people.

<b>

However, since there was no lower limit, I always participated alone. I can't get enough of the thrilling battles.

Party matches are definitely more fun than individual matches where victory is almost guaranteed.

<b>

Early in the morning, I went to the arena with Thunder's Trajectory, and I informed Regulus and Dino, who were having a meeting, that I would be participating.

The two welcomed me joyfully, so all that was left was to relax and watch the matches until it was my turn.

<b>

"They're taking it more seriously than I expected. That's good."

<b>

"Well, even though it's a showcase, I wouldn't want to lose in front of so many people."

<b>

"I understand that feeling. I would feel like dying if I lost too."

<b>

I couldn't help but nod repeatedly. I don't want to experience that feeling.

<b>

"Is it really that bad...?"

<b>

"Master is just competitive."

<b>

"You can't talk, Sera!"

<b>

Currently, Sera is sitting to my left, and Thunder's Trajectory is to my right.

We are seated in the middle of the bowl-shaped audience area. Unlike regular seats, this is a plush sofa seat, making it the best spot to see the stage where the matches are held.

<b>

Nearby are Fenon and the royal family, but there are no other spectators around. It's probably for safety reasons, but it seems they aren't wary of us.

<b>

However, while it's understandable for the royal family, I wonder if it's really okay for us to be treated so specially in this packed arena.

The titles and B-rank dungeon clearances might be more special than I imagined.

<b>

"…Sera's turn is coming up soon. I guess the winner is still Ray."

<b>

While absentmindedly watching the match, Shin says.

<b>

There was an individual match in the morning, and a party match in the afternoon.

<b>

Currently on stage, Ray, the captain of the knights and Sera's brother, is in the finals against the knight captain. The knight captain is doing well, but Ray seems to have the upper hand.

<b>

By the way, it seems both of them have changed their job to martial swordsman. Perhaps due to lack of time, both are below level 20.

<b>

However, he is indeed Sera's brother.

His fighting style reminds me of Sera when she challenged me to a mock battle. In other words, Sera has been growing while absorbing skills from him.

<b>

He isn't overly muscular, but it's clear from a distance that he is well-trained. His bright red hair, the same as Sera's, is styled in a wolf cut that reaches his shoulders, and his face resembles that of a carnivorous beast, which suits that hairstyle well.

<b>

"Indeed... Brother Ray is strong."

<b>

Watching the match nearing its conclusion, Sera murmurs in a small voice.

If she were to watch her own match objectively, her eyes would probably pop out in surprise. She has grown that much.

<b>

"Have confidence. Sera-san, who has been trained by SR, will surely be strong."

<b>

"That's right. To an incredible level."

<b>

Encouraged by the women, Sera awkwardly lowers her chin.

As they said, I think Sera will just beat her brother without worry.

<b>

Speaking of which――,

<b>

"Have you guys not actually seen Sera's growth? Why are you so confident?"

<b>

"“Because SR is our master.””

<b>

"That's not an answer!"

<b>

Don't treat me like a weirdo!

<b>

I let out a big sigh, saying "Hah," loud enough for the two to hear, just as a loud cheer erupted, drowning out my voice.

<b>

It seems the match has concluded.

<b>

Looking towards the match venue, I see the knight captain kneeling with his sword as a staff and Ray raising his sword towards the heavens.

As Thunder's Trajectory and Sera predicted, the winner seems to be Sera's brother――Ray.

<b>

"Alright, it's your turn."

<b>

I lightly pat her back.

I wondered if this was a bit too familiar for a woman, but Sera looked visibly tense, saying "Y-yes," and that was the least of her worries.

<b>

<b>

"Now, in 15 minutes, we will hold a match between the individual champion, Ray = Bernot, and the B-rank dungeon clearers――Sera = Bernot."

<b>

<b>

The woman using a loudspeaker magic tool announced the progress of the match.

Being hosted by the kingdom, her tone is somewhat formal. The fact that only knights are participating is likely one reason why the spectators, who are explorers, are not making noise.

<b>

However, since Sera had been active as an explorer, the audience began to buzz upon hearing her name.

It's unclear whether they were looking forward to this match or surprised by the sibling matchup――the reason is uncertain.

<b>

From somewhere, I heard a deep voice shouting, "Sera-sama!"

That must be one of the explorers. I feel like I recognize that voice.

<b>

Slowly standing up from the sofa, Sera takes a deep breath.

She looks at Shin, Suzu, Laika, and then me, nodding slowly with deliberate movements.

<b>

"I'm going."

<b>

Saying that, she began to walk towards the backstage leading to the central stage.

Since she has never won against her opponent, she must be feeling a bit weak-hearted――we, the spectators, sent her cheers as she walked with a slightly hunched back.

<b>

"Hey, relax!"

<b>

"Don't lose to Ray!"

<b>

"Sera-san will be fine."

<b>

"Do your best, we're cheering for you."

<b>

I wonder if our voices reached Sera.

...If the reason for Sera's recent loss of spirit lies with Ray, can she properly demonstrate her abilities?

<b>

Even if I worry, there's nothing more we can do.

Sera's abilities surpass those of her brother, so it all comes down to whether she can overcome her own heart.

<b>

Sera's figure gradually became smaller, turned the corner, and disappeared from our sight.
