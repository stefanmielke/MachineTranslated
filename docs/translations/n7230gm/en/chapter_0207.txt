Following Crescent, Hime-Ski has also arrived in this world.

She seemed clearly shaken and unable to grasp the situation, so I decided to wake up Crescent, who was rolling her eyes, and leave Hime-Ski to her.

<b>

I thought it would be easier to talk with Crescent, who I’ve spent the most time with, so I moved to my room. I also explained the situation to Sera and Fenon, who had just finished bathing, and asked them to come to my room.

Sitting on the sofa in the room, Sera was next to me, while Fenon and Shiri were sitting across from us.

<b>

"Then, does that mean that person also came from the same world as Esuar?"

<b>

"That's right. She's as strong as Crescent!"

<b>

"I can't fall behind either."

<b>

Sera clenched her fist tightly. I thought that if anyone could reach the level of Crescent and the others, it might be her—could that be favoritism on my part?

As I was thinking that, Sera suddenly grabbed my hand tightly.

<b>

"Uh, I don't want to say this too much, but... well, you know. I don't want to spend less time with Esuar!"

<b>

"Hehe, I feel the same way."

<b>

Fenon agreed with Sera's somewhat hurried words.

Is this what it is? Are they worried about new fiancées because more women are around me? It would be embarrassing if I were wrong... but it's to reassure the ones I like.

It can't be helped.

<b>

"I'm happy enough with the current situation. So, don't worry. I'll make sure not to make Sera or Fenon sad."

<b>

When I said that, Fenon chuckled elegantly.

<b>

"Thank you very much. However, Esuar, I must let you know that both Sera and I are willing to accept up to two more."

<b>

Fenon glanced at Shiri, who was sitting next to her.

Shiri, who was the focus of that gaze, had turned bright red and was looking down.

I still remember her encouraging words when she first arrived in this world.

<b>

'If by any chance, His Majesty or those around him start saying they will execute the summoned Esuar, I will take responsibility and get you out of this country. At that time, I will accompany you, if you allow me.'

<b>

How much comfort those words gave me when I was anxious and unsure about my own fate.

It might have been something she considered natural to say, but I was incredibly happy to feel like I had an ally.

As for Noah, well, that's not something to think about right now.

<b>

"Regarding that, let's discuss it together once everyone has calmed down. For now, let's focus on Hime-Ski."

<b>

I used those words as a cue to talk about her.

Well, most of it was similar to Crescent, so even if I explained, it would only take a minute or two.

<b>

"That 'Hime-Ski' person, is that really her name?"

<b>

Once I finished speaking, Shiri timidly raised her hand to ask.

<b>

"Ah—... I'm not sure how to explain that. Let's ask her directly."

<b>

Crescent's name seemed like it could still fit in this world, but Hime-Ski was a bit... off.

Of course, Fenon, but Sera is also the daughter of a noble family, so if we're talking about a princess, she would be one. A name that seems to publicly declare 'I like' to such two might feel a bit... awkward.

<b>

"Also, according to Lady Idea, it seems that I can bring my parents back to life."

<b>

When I said that,

<b>

"Is that really possible!?"

<b>

"Is it true, Esuar!?"

<b>

Sera and Fenon exclaimed in surprise almost simultaneously. Shiri, who was present when I was talking to Lady Idea, just nodded.

<b>

"I'm planning to ask Lady Idea to confirm whether my parents wish for reincarnation. So, I still don't know what will happen."

<b>

It was so sudden regarding Hime-Ski that I didn't have time to confirm such things.

I wonder if she would be happy to come back to life? She didn't die because she wanted to, and I hope she hasn't had any unpleasant experiences.

<b>

By the way, if my parents from my memories were to come back, I feel like they would just say, "Lucky!" and leave it at that.

Those two are incredibly lighthearted, or however you might put it... My dad was so excited when he got laid off, saying, "Yippee! Every day's a Sunday now!" and my mom immediately started planning a trip.

<b>

Well, they did start working again right after the trip.

If I were to reunite with them, I wonder what kind of feelings I would have.

I might end up crying from being overwhelmed.

Also, I need to explain the current situation—oh.

I have to explain that I'm married to two people...
