# 82 The First Recognized Collapse

<b>

<b>

<b>

Intense tinnitus.

<b>

The collapse of the scenery, as if looking at a bug screen.

<b>

A child's voice echoing directly in my head, saying, "Defeat Venom."

<b>

Six dungeons that appeared as if to surround the house.

<b>

I tried to list what had happened in my mind for the time being, but there was not a single thing I could understand the cause or reason for. The only certain thing was that it was clearly not "normal."

I felt that something bad was about to happen――.

<b>

While the guards of the duke's house and the royal family were hurriedly communicating with magical tools, I approached the teleportation magic circle that led into the dungeon to check the rank of the dungeons that had appeared.

<b>

"Sir Esuar! It's dangerous! We haven't even confirmed the rank yet, so it would be better not to step in carelessly."

<b>

One of the guards, noticing me, called out in a flustered manner.

I turned to the direction of the voice and smiled. Although I was in complete chaos, I still had the composure to put on a forced smile.

<b>

"I'm fine. I have a rough idea of what's going on, and if it comes to it, I can return in an emergency."

<b>

"But..."

<b>

"It's okay. I know it sounds odd coming from me, but I'm quite capable, right?"

<b>

Without waiting for the guard's response, I stepped into the temple-like building.

I wanted to clarify this incomprehensible situation as soon as possible.

While being watched by the guards, I set my license card on the stone pillar that had appeared――,

<b>

"Just as I thought, it's an S-rank..."

<b>

As expected, my license, which had no record of clearing an A-rank dungeon, did not activate the teleportation magic circle. It was clear that this was indeed an S-rank dungeon.

I informed the guards that I couldn't enter with my license card and crossed my arms.

<b>

...In that case, I should assume that the other five dungeons are of the same rank. However, knowing that doesn't solve anything.

<b>

But better safe than sorry.

<b>

I tried setting my license card on all the dungeons that had appeared to see if I could enter. As expected, I couldn't enter any of them.

<b>

If I could actually enter the dungeon, I could confirm which country the dungeon was supposed to appear in based on the type of monsters, but I couldn't do that now.

If only some unfamiliar monsters appeared, it would be understandable as a new element that didn't exist in the game world.

<b>

I stepped back from the dungeons and thought while watching the flustered guards.

<b>

"I understand that they're all S-rank or higher, but..."

<b>

Because I understood that, I became even more confused.

<b>

In the VRMMO Tempest, it doesn't matter which country's dungeon is cleared. If a B-rank dungeon is cleared, A-rank dungeons appear all over the world, and if an A-rank dungeon is cleared, S-rank dungeons appear similarly worldwide.

<b>

Do the other five countries also have six S-rank dungeons appearing like this Lindell Kingdom? Or is it set up differently from the game, where dungeons only appear in the country that cleared them?

<b>

...I can't figure it out.

<b>

Should I ask the royal family or the guild about the situation in each country?

Thinking that, I looked around to find a guard who seemed free, and my eyes caught a glimpse of long, bright red hair fluttering in the wind.

<b>

She looked surprised, her eyes wide as she glanced around. Of course, she would be surprised if so many dungeons appeared around the house.

When Sera met my gaze, she hurriedly ran over to me.

<b>

"Esuar! What is going on!?"

<b>

"Well, to be honest, I have no idea either. For now, I've confirmed that it's an S-rank dungeon, but I don't know why so many have appeared in this place..."

<b>

"You don't know either...?"

<b>

Saying that, she placed her hand on her chin as if deep in thought.

If things had gone as they should have, I would have been able to convey my feelings to her by now... Things really don't go as planned.

<b>

Speaking of which.

<b>

"Sera, just before this dungeon appeared, did you hear a child's voice? It felt like it was directly in my head."

<b>

"No, I don't think I heard anything. I only noticed the dungeon because of the guards' commotion. Until then, I was leisurely drinking coffee."

<b>

When I asked about dizziness or tinnitus, she shook her head seriously.

...Hmm. Was that phenomenon something that only happened to me? Or was it something that just didn't happen to Sera?

<b>

I don't know.

<b>

"What did the child's voice that you heard say?"

<b>

"Oh, it said to 'defeat Venom.'"

<b>

"？ What is Venom? A monster?"

<b>

As expected, she shouldn't normally know. After all, we are in a dungeon that doesn't exist in this world yet. Knowing about it would be abnormal.

<b>

"Well, something like that―― For now, the guards seem busy, so let's check if Fenon and Shiri heard the child's voice too. They're at home, right?"

<b>

I couldn't see them around the house. Probably, Sera was the only one who came to check as a scout.

If I ask Fenon and the others, I should be able to find out whether the mysterious phenomenon that occurred just before the dungeon appeared happened only to me or if it just didn't happen to Sera.

<b>

I thought to ask Sera, but she was frozen. Rather than being surprised, she looked like she was in a daze.

Sera maintained that expression and tilted her head.

<b>

And then, my heart tightened.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Um, excuse me. Fenon? And Shiri, are they friends of Esuar? It's the first time I've heard those names."

<b>

<b>

<b>

..................Huh? The first time I've heard those names――?

<b>

"......Hey, even I, who am usually mild-mannered, am getting angry. This is not the time for jokes. It's a situation that could be called an emergency."

<b>

My heart was pounding violently, shaking my eardrums.

While I scolded Sera with words, I understood that her expression was not one of joking or lying.

Please, I beg you. Tell me it's a joke.

<b>

"But I really don't know."

<b>

"That can't be true! Fenon is your best friend, right!? She's the princess you risked your life to save!"

<b>

Sera answered with an apologetic expression, trembling at my frantic words.

<b>

"Is it about Elixir? That was for the first princess, Lady Lapis――"

<b>

"That person is the second princess! I'm talking about the first princess, Fenon!"

<b>

She was someone I hardly interacted with, but I had heard her name from Fenon. Lady Lapis is the second princess who was to become engaged to a prince from another country in place of the sickly Fenon.

<b>

"What the hell...?"

<b>

The conversation was completely out of sync.

Just as I was confused, I could feel that Sera was equally bewildered.

<b>

Calm down.

<b>

Take a deep breath.

I took a step back from Sera, closed my eyes, and took a deep breath, slowly exhaling. I repeated that three times.

<b>

Then, I silently took Sera's hand and walked towards the nearest guard. She followed me without resistance.

It didn't matter whether they were busy or not. I grabbed the shoulder of the nearest guard and forcibly turned him to face me to get some answers.

<b>

And then, I understood.

<b>

The people of this world did not notice that Fenon and Shiri had disappeared. Moreover, they were being treated as if they had never existed in the first place.

<b>

<b>

Only one person. Excluding me, the anomaly in this world.
