"It's been a while since I came here with Sera."

<b>

There is no response to my words, but instead, I hear the crunching sound of snow being stepped on at my feet.

This is an S-rank dungeon located about two hours away by horse from the royal capital of Lindale. It is also the place where the large spider monster, commonly known as 'Cotton Candy,' appeared— a memorable spot where I exchanged kisses with Sera before the collapse.

<b>

Before the collapse, it had conveniently appeared right next to Leinas's house, but now it is located as per the game's layout. It's not close, but not far either.

<b>

"I ran here relying on my status, but anyone passing by would probably be scared."

<b>

I still can't ride a horse.

I haven't practiced or even tried, really. At this point, I think running is faster and it's probably unnecessary.

<b>

Since Shin and the others conquered the A-rank dungeon and this S-rank dungeon appeared, the nearby village has rapidly developed. I glanced at it from a distance before entering the dungeon, and it was a construction boom everywhere. I never thought about it while playing the game, but dungeons likely have a significant impact on the economy.

<b>

The village—or rather, the town—already seems to have several inns built, and if prioritizing the pace of leveling up, it would certainly be more efficient to stay near the dungeon. However, since I've got a new home, I don't want to live a single life away from my family before marriage.

Moreover, I want to level up the Sword Saint to 100 before conquering it, so defeating the boss, Cotton Candy, is also off the table.

<b>

It might take a bit of time, but there's no deadline. I need to cherish my time with them too.

<b>

Five months have passed since I started leveling up in the S-rank dungeon.

The Sword Saint's level has reached 99, and it is expected to hit 100 in a day or two.

It has taken longer than anticipated due to the slow pace of leveling, but I don't feel like I've wasted time. The days spent with everyone were indeed enjoyable.

<b>

For these five months, I have basically been heading to the dungeon alone, but occasionally I would dive with the ASR party or go together to the dungeon entrance and then split up from there.

<b>

The days have been particularly uneventful, but the only change has been that the Vinzett siblings have started visiting the royal capital—more accurately, our home—frequently, and we have been having mock battles on holidays.

<b>

"I should probably tell His Majesty, but—no, it’s just too..."

<b>

Today is a day off, and I'm not going to the dungeon.

Since we have important matters to discuss, I gathered all the servants except for two of Ray's subordinates, the Vinzett siblings, and the three from the Thunderbolt Trails, along with the ASR members in the living room.

<b>

In front of me sits Ray, who has a pained expression, holding his head in distress.

The family of Shiri, who is standing by, and the Vinzett siblings sitting next to Ray also have strained faces.

<b>

What I conveyed to them was the unvarnished truth: that the world had collapsed once.

Once I conquer the S-rank dungeon, I believe our lives will change drastically.

Before things get hectic, I wanted to share everything with those I have come to trust—this was a decision I made after consulting with Thunderbolt Trails, ASR, and Regulus.

<b>

"It's understandable that you find it hard to believe. However, you should be able to see it from the SR's level, right?"

<b>

Shin presses on, addressing Ray and the others.

<b>

Yes, my level is not normal.

It's not just that my level is high; the levels of my second and third jobs are uniformly high, which, even with maximum talent and effort, would be impossible within the time frame.

<b>

Considering that the B-rank and A-rank dungeons were only recently cleared in this world, it wouldn't make sense for me to reach my current level unless my age exceeded 100.

<b>

I glance at Ray, who has a bitter expression, and then address everyone.

<b>

"So, regarding this matter, I trust you all enough to share it—though you probably won't be believed if you spread it around, I ask you to keep it confidential. However, it seems many have caught on to the status bonuses, so it might be officially announced soon."

<b>

"…That’s true. The knight order is currently leveling up their first jobs. We still don’t know exactly which stats will increase, like with you, SR-dono, but..."

<b>

"It would be best to collaborate with the Explorer Guild on that front. After all, Regulus knows everything."

<b>

"Haha… I had the opportunity to discuss that matter, but it seems I was completely deceived by the Guild Master."

<b>

From Ray's wry smile, I sensed the strain he was under.

<b>

"Please don’t take it the wrong way. It wasn’t something we could discuss lightly."

<b>

"Yes, of course, Fenon-sama. I finally understand why you are so strong."

<b>

With a deep breath, Ray leaned back against the chair and looked up at the ceiling. And then—

<b>

"Damn it, I’ll catch up to you soon, Shin. One day, the knight order will claim the title of the strongest in the world."

<b>

With a teasing smile, he said that.

Then, next to Shin, who responded with an annoyingly handsome smile, Suzu tilted her head to the side.

<b>

"Shouldn't you aim for SR instead?"

<b>

"No, that's a bit... SR-dono is in a different league..."

<b>

As Ray muttered that while averting his gaze downward, the comrades, excluding the servants, laughed.

It feels like I'm the only one being recognized as a non-human, but I suppose I'll let it slide for today.
