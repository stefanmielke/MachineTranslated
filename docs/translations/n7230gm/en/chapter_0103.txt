# 100 White Lotus

<b>

<b>

<b>

The main reasons I was able to reach a state of being invincible in the game Tempest are threefold.

<b>

First of all, I was a NEET.

<b>

It may seem like a lackluster reason, but it’s the truth, so there’s no helping it.

Eating and sleeping. In an environment where I could devote all my time to gaming without anyone complaining, it was an incredibly important factor for leveling up and honing my skills.

<b>

Among the top players, there seemed to be some working adults, but I imagine they were sacrificing a lot of sleep to play. Even if they were leeching off their teammates to level up, it undoubtedly took a considerable amount of time.

<b>

The second reason is my "eyes."

<b>

These eyes of mine, which had improved dramatically only in the world of Tempest—apparently, they are called the Eyes of Origin. I was told that it wasn’t a talent I was born with, but a power given to me by Noah. It’s kind of annoying.

<b>

I didn’t want to admit it easily, but the abilities of the eyes explained by that brat were all convincing, and some of them were things I didn’t even know about, so I had no choice but to acknowledge it.

When using the skill of foresight, I’m seeing just a tiny bit into the future—unless someone told me, I wouldn’t have noticed.

<b>

And the final element.

This was the profession of Demon Lord—the acquired skills—and the weapons—all of these fit perfectly into my combat style.

<b>

The skills learned by the Demon Lord at level 100 are passive skills—meaning they are always active.

When I reached level 100 as a Demon Lord, I was excited to think I could summon a massive lightning strike, but I was severely disappointed to find out it was a passive skill.

I could have learned this in advance by looking at strategy sites, but I didn’t want to check such sites when I wasn’t stuck.

<b>

The name of the skill is—“Ruler of Demons.”

<b>

Its effect increases the effectiveness of all magic skills by 20% and halves the amount of magic used, which is extraordinary.

When I first saw the skill description, I thought, “That seems kind of plain,” but of course, a skill obtained simultaneously with maxing out a third job couldn’t be plain.

<b>

In Tempest, where there are no magic recovery potions and magic only recovers over time, it is an extremely useful skill.

And above all, when my INT is at SSS and I activate the sage skill “Body Enhancement,” the recovery amount over time exceeds the magic consumption. Moreover, the effect is at 120%, so frankly, it’s incredibly strong.

Well, that’s assuming I’ve properly earned the player bonuses unrelated to the Demon Lord.

<b>

And—what enhances the already strong power of the Demon Lord is the weapon I was fond of at the time—“White Lotus.”

<b>

“Oh! This is it! It’s so nostalgic! Thank you, Noah!”

<b>

The small sword with a pearl-like shine that I hadn’t held in a long time.

I was so happy that I couldn’t help but thank that brat. I lightly swung it around and repeatedly checked the grip.

Yeah, it’s good. Very good.

<b>

“That weapon is special, you know. It requires quite a bit of energy.”

<b>

Sorry for being late—Noah added at the end, resting her chin on the table with a somewhat tired expression. Before I knew it, she had become quite accustomed to this room.

<b>

“Don’t worry about it. Even though I’ve acquired Ruler of Demons, I wanted to practice a bit until it felt natural to my body.”

<b>

It had been exactly 700 days since the sky turned purple.

In other words, it was almost two years since I parted ways with Sera and the others.

<b>

My status had been upgraded to the point where I could fight Venom for a while now, but the crucial weapon hadn’t been ready yet.

Noah looked a bit apologetic since I had been waiting for the weapon for quite a long time.

<b>

“How much preparation time do you think we need for the battle against Venom? To be honest, keeping this world intact is quite precarious. No matter how many monsters you defeat, I’m not sure it can last another two years.”

<b>

Noah said this with a serious expression. For about a month now, she had been looking unwell.

It’s hard to notice since I see her every day, but it feels like the discoloration on her body has expanded since the first time I met her. It goes without saying that it’s due to Venom’s influence.

<b>

“Are you stupid? I don’t need that much time; a day is enough. I’ve been fighting based on White Lotus from the start, so I just need to adjust my range.”

<b>

“...Now that you mention it, that’s true. But before the battle with Venom, I want to store some energy too, so can you keep defeating monsters? Your soul isn’t affected by Venom, but your body and equipment need protection, and you also need to recover your stamina.”

<b>

“Ah... is it because I consumed energy to create the weapon? How many do I need to defeat?”

<b>

Honestly, I just want to move forward.

<b>

I want to defeat Venom, reclaim the world, and meet my friends as soon as possible.

I wouldn’t mind being treated like a stranger; I just want to see them with my own eyes. Even if I can’t talk to them, I’d be satisfied just to watch from a distance.

<b>

“Take your time and defeat about 10,000 more. If you do that, we should be fine. It’ll probably take about six months, though…”

<b>

Noah said with a wry smile as she presented the target number.

<b>

Not just any monsters, but 10,000 bosses from S-rank dungeons. That’s why she probably laughed when she said that number. It’s an absurd figure—she thought so.

<b>

Even with the skills of the Demon Lord and my fully prepared stats, the number of monsters I could defeat in 24 hours is around 60. Considering break times, it would take at least 200 days.

<b>

However, she quickly changed her expression.

Did she read my mind, or did she see my face?

<b>

“Have you been mentally broken by Venom? I’m holding White Lotus right now.”

<b>

I said this while bringing the tip of White Lotus close to her eyes and nose.

She looked wide-eyed as if she remembered something, staring at the white small sword in my hand.

<b>

That’s right, remember.

If you can’t remember, I’ll think of it for you, so just peek into your head and reconfirm.

The me who played Tempest. The me who reigned at the top. Just before coming to this world, what kind of battles was I fighting?

<b>

“A month is more than enough.”

<b>

With a grin, I told Noah that I would achieve the 10,000 monster defeat in one-sixth of the time she suggested—so I declared.

<b>

I’m not trying to show off. I’m not feeling overconfident just because I got a strong weapon.

<b>

It’s just that White Lotus and I are such a good match that it makes it possible.

What kind of effect does White Lotus have? (*´∀｀*)
