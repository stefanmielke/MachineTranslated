# Aー１１３ Noah and Parents

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The names of my parents are Rokudo Matsuri and Rokudo Akira.

<b>

It seems that both my mom and dad had heard to some extent about the workings of this world and the current situation—well, my position and relationships—from Lady Idea before they reincarnated here.

<b>

Since they seemed to know about Noah as well, I thought that was probably the case, but understanding it properly makes it somewhat embarrassing.

<b>

Additionally, they seem to know that I’m married to Phanon and Sera, so… as a son, I’m really glad they didn’t say anything about the polygamy. I really don’t want to fight with my parents over this.

<b>

"Still... you look young."

<b>

Since Lady Idea had somehow left the room, I relaxed and stared at the two of them closely.

Mom had just said she turned twenty-five, after all. They are exactly the age they were when I was born—meaning this is the first time I’m seeing them in this form in real-time.

<b>

Moreover, they’re not wearing traditional Japanese clothing but outfits that seem familiar in this world, which was refreshing as well.

<b>

"At this point, it wouldn’t be a problem to call you my big brother, would it?"

<b>

"Definitely a big problem. Well, having this age gap and calling you my parents is also a problem, though."

<b>

"Well, well, let’s not sweat the small stuff. Since we couldn’t spend time together before, we can be together longer here."

<b>

Well, that’s true. In fact, since I’m younger now, it feels more like a plus. I’ll take it as a reward from Lady Idea.

<b>

And so, the conversation between parent and child began in a friendly manner.

They talked about how they had been living after they died, including the fact that they had quit their jobs, and everything that had happened in this world.

<b>

"So, I have money."

<b>

I don’t know exactly because I’ve never properly calculated my funds, but including the things I haven’t revealed, it feels like I could build several castles.

<b>

"Oh… could it be that I’m going to be a freeloader?"

<b>

"Well, there’s enough money to live comfortably for a lifetime, so you two can do as you please. If you want to work, I can probably introduce you to a job. If you want to explore dungeons, I’ll help with that too."

<b>

But in that case, it would be pointless if these two died, so I’d have to forcibly level them up and have them explore dungeons in safe zones.

<b>

After all, I doubt the “dungeon where you can resurrect even if you die” that Lady Idea is going to create will be profitable. I think it will only serve as entertainment, including leveling up.

<b>

"Well, I think I’ll take my time to think about that. We still only know a little about this world."

<b>

"That’s true."

<b>

That was settled. I’ll have them stay at my house for a while and let them leisurely expand their understanding of this world. I should also inform His Majesty, just in case. He might help with various conveniences. After all, connections are what you should have.

<b>

After talking with my parents for a while, I took them to the living room and introduced them to my friends.

<b>

The most interesting reaction was from my parents towards Phanon. They were all excited to meet a real princess. Well, Phanon is not only the first princess but also cute like a doll. Of course, Sera is beautiful too.

<b>

In response, Phanon was praising me to the skies. Sera joined in, so I felt like I wanted to escape. I mean, she really said, "Mr. SR is my life." I was happy, though.

<b>

"Did I do something bad…? You don’t have to hold back."

<b>

After the greetings, the duo of Thunderbolt and Tempest quickly left my house. They seemed to be considerate.

<b>

Noah was not showing up at the moment, so for a while, it became a situation where my parents were talking with Shiri, Sera, and Phanon. Of course, I was included.

<b>

And that night.

<b>

While talking privately with my parents in my room, there was a knock at the door. The one who entered was Noah, who hadn’t shown up for a while.

<b>

"…What’s wrong? You look like that."

<b>

I thought she would show up with her usual carefree expression, but she kept her mouth shut and looked straight at me before glancing at Dad and Mom.

<b>

"You are Noah, without a doubt."

<b>

Mom, who had been looking out the window, approached Noah as she entered the room and spoke.

When she got within about a meter, Noah responded.

<b>

"Yes—I am Noah. The former administrator of this world—and the former god who called Rokudo Shuui to this world."

<b>

"I see… then, excuse me."

<b>

What on earth is Mom going to excuse herself for?—I thought vaguely as I watched the two of them, and then Mom’s hand moved. Soon after, a sharp sound echoed in the room.

<b>

Mom slapped Noah’s cheek. Before I knew it, Dad was also standing next to Mom, lightly bowing his head towards Noah.

<b>

"—Huh? No, no, no, what are you doing, Mom?!"

<b>

Even though she was a god, she just slapped her! I mean, it’s a bit strange for me to say that since I call her a brat.

I hurriedly tried to step between them, but Noah stopped me with her hand.

<b>

"No, it’s fine, big brother—no, Rokudo Shuui-kun. I’ve essentially used their son. I’ve made him walk through numerous hells."

<b>

Noah said with a wry smile while looking at me, then turned to face Dad and Mom.

<b>

"Calling him to this world was the best choice for me. It was a glimmer of hope. The last hope—so I have no regrets. Therefore, feel free to hate me as much as you want."

<b>

At first glance, it looked like a conversation between two adults and a child, but the content was too heavy. It’s something I don’t need to worry about anymore. I understand that it was necessary.

<b>

I have to somehow calm my parents down; if I convey what Noah has gone through, they should understand.

<b>

"Um, Mom, Dad. I’m fine—so please don’t think badly of her. Sure, there were times I suffered, but thanks to that, I am who I am now."

<b>

I can say this for sure. Even if I had continued living on Earth, I wouldn’t have found this much happiness. Reuniting with Dad and Mom was something that could only happen in this world.

<b>

Hearing my words, my parents exchanged glances. Then, they both chuckled.

<b>

"Well, this is a matter of parental responsibility or something… I opposed it, though. Isn’t it dangerous to go against a god?"

<b>

"That’s true. But you can’t just say, ‘I showed your son hell’ and expect a simple ‘Oh, really?’ in response, right? I’m sorry, Noah."

<b>

"Hehe, why are you apologizing? You two don’t need to apologize at all."

<b>

Like my parents, Noah smiled.

<b>

I can’t quite grasp it, but it seems to be settling down. I’ve heard that my personality resembles my mom’s, so I feel very complicated about this.
