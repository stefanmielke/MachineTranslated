# 28 SR's Strategy

<b>

<b>

<b>

After the audience with His Majesty, the only remaining task at the royal castle was to explain things to Lord Dino. At the same time, it seemed we would also be receiving our reward money, so the five of us sat on the sofa in the reception room, waiting for Lord Dino to arrive.

<b>

"I'm confused because there are too many surprises."

<b>

Shin said with a serious expression.

<b>

I had no intention of participating in the conversation. I was in despair over being given the title of 'Hero,' which was far more than I could handle.

<b>

I had been looking forward to enjoying a free life in another world, but now I felt like I was trapped inside an Iron Maiden, famous for its torture devices. I couldn't move freely, and inside, I was skewered. How did it come to this?

I gazed at the four of them with a completely relaxed expression.

<b>

Suzuki and Laika were excitedly saying, "What should we do, what should we do?" I couldn't tell if they were happy about the title or the large sum of money, but it was clear they weren't listening to Shin's words.

<b>

I wanted a reward that I could be that happy about too.

<b>

As for Sera, she was holding her head and looking dejected.

I heard her mumbling, "Why is it just me..." so she was probably disappointed because she was the only one who didn't receive a title.

<b>

The Thunderbolt Trail is the top party in the country, and my abilities are unknown, plus I have some accomplishments like solo clearing dungeons.

However, Sera had been struggling until recently with clearing C-rank dungeons. That might be related.

<b>

But she also has the knowledge I taught her, so she would likely achieve something soon enough to earn a title. After all, it's given for clearing B-rank dungeons.

<b>

"............ I think we should organize this one by one."

<b>

When thirty seconds passed and no one responded to Shin, he finally moved on with the conversation by himself.

Go ahead. I'm busy thinking about my future.

<b>

"First of all, SR."

<b>

I was called out immediately. I suppressed the urge to sigh and reluctantly replied, "What is it?"

<b>

"You were said to have been 'summoned,' right? What does that mean?"

<b>

I knew that would be brought up.

When His Majesty talked about it, they were surprised.

<b>

"Uh... to put it simply, they tried to summon a hero to save the princess, but instead, a guy who's not a hero at all came from another world."

<b>

"So, that 'another world' isn't just another country, right?"

<b>

"That's right. The culture is completely different, and the creatures are different too. It's really troublesome."

<b>

In reality, the troublesome part isn't being summoned; it's the title of 'Hero' that was given to me.

<b>

At my statement, Suzuki, who had been excited until a moment ago, interjected, "Wait a minute!" and joined the conversation.

<b>

"That's strange. SR knows too much about this world. There's no way he could be a resident of another world."

<b>

I had shared quite a bit of information about this world that people here still didn't know. But I thought I had already addressed that before.

<b>

"I mentioned it when we talked at the guild, but I have no intention of answering the question of 'how do you know?' I'll leave that to your imagination. Whether it's a god or a time traveler."

<b>

"…Now that you mention it, you did say something like that."

<b>

Suzuki seemed dissatisfied but backed down.

When I shifted my gaze to the other three, it seemed Shin, Laika, and Sera had also heard my words. I probably wouldn't receive similar questions from them in the future.

<b>

"I understand about SR. If there's anything you don't understand about this world, feel free to rely on us. The knowledge you provided has broken down the walls we had in front of us. I promise we will be of help."

<b>

Oh. Shin seems quite leader-like. He looked like a pitiful person when he was ignored.

<b>

"Thank you. I'll be counting on you then."

<b>

"Yeah. Now, about the title—why does SR not seem happy? You received the title of 'Hero,' you know? We're all so surprised and happy that we could go crazy."

<b>

At Shin's words, Suzuki and Laika nodded vigorously.

Is it really that wonderful for them?

<b>

"I'm an otherworlder, as I mentioned earlier, right? I don't understand what the title means, and if it causes me to stand out, I feel sorry for His Majesty, but I don't want the title... If you'd like, I could give it to Shin. Being a hero and a pioneer sounds great."

<b>

"Are you out of your mind? What do you mean you don't want it?!"

<b>

Tch. I thought I'd give it a shot, but it was impossible after all.

<b>

"I mean it literally. What good is a title anyway?"

<b>

"What good? —You see, for people living in this country, a title is a dream come true, undoubtedly something that would be recorded in the kingdom's history books, an honorable thing. Not only explorers, but merchants and nobles would also look up to you. Plus, it carries power equivalent to that of a count's house. It would surely be quite convenient."

<b>

Shin puffed out his chest as if to say, "How about that?"

Even if it's called an honor for clearing a B-rank dungeon, it's still troublesome, and even if the title carries power equivalent to a count's house—I've got that.

<b>

I took out the dagger from my inventory, which I had only pulled out once, and showed it to Shin.

<b>

"How does that compare to this?"

<b>

"—Wha—That's the royal crest!?"

<b>

"Yes. I received it as an apology for being summoned to this world."

<b>

When I said that, Shin grabbed his clothing around his chest tightly and furrowed his brows in pain.

<b>

"Please don't surprise me any more than this... Since your battle, my heart has been under too much strain."

<b>

In conclusion, it seems the royal crest is indeed stronger.

<b>

However, I also dislike relying on the royal family's protection forever, and there may come a time when it will be useful. Well, it should be better to have it than not.

<b>

...I have to think that way to cope.

<b>

Once Shin-san calms down, the conversation shifts to the next topic.

<b>

The topic is how we should explain things to Lord Dino.

Thinking about it now, this is probably what we should have discussed first... but none of us, myself included, were calm at the time.

Let’s switch gears and move the conversation forward quickly.

<b>

"First, let's keep quiet about the bonus, and I think Lord Dino has already heard about us diving into dungeons with our lower jobs."

<b>

In my case, Regulus had confirmed it with Lord Dino, so that's certain, and it seems that Thunderbolt Trail and Sera were also under close observation as the princess's hopes, so Lord Dino must have been paying attention to their movements.

<b>

"Then, can't we just say it was thanks to that derived advanced job?"

<b>

"That's impossible. After all, we haven't leveled up that job. If our statuses are checked, it will be obvious."

<b>

As Sera said, their derived secondary jobs are still at level one.

<b>

"Then, can't we just say that SR was just too strong? If the Chancellor knows about SR's dungeon-clearing achievements, he would probably be convinced."

<b>

"If we say that, I'll be targeted again. I don't want to stand out any more than this."

<b>

But it feels like it's already too late for that.

<b>

We all crossed our arms and thought.

As we exchanged opinions, I began to get increasingly irritated, feeling the emotion of "Why do I have to explain the reasons?" rising within me.

If I don't want to talk, I should just stay silent.

<b>

We did something that others couldn't do.

Instead of thinking of excuses as if we were running away, shouldn't we be a bit more assertive?

<b>

Thinking that way, one idea immediately came to mind, so I quickly spoke up.

<b>

"I have a proposal."

<b>

This method should provide benefits to everyone. Although Sera would once again be left out.

<b>

"What is it?"

<b>

"I can still make Shin and the others stronger. Of course, they will be able to clear the unprecedented A-rank dungeons as well. If you want training, I'll be your opponent, and I will continue to provide advice and knowledge."

<b>

"Does that mean you're asking us to become your disciples...?"

<b>

"It's not such a formal relationship, but it's something similar."

<b>

When I said that, Shin turned to Suzuki and Laika. They were nodding eagerly. If I'm not mistaken, that reaction means they agree to becoming my disciples.

Shin also slowly nodded while keeping his gaze on them, then turned his eyes back to me.

<b>

"SR is strong—that's a fact recognized by everyone here. If that means we can clear A-rank dungeons, that's a wish come true, but... what do you want in return?"

<b>

As expected of Shin. It's helpful that he gets to the point quickly.

Since I suddenly started this conversation, he must think there’s something behind it—he must have thought that.

In fact, it was as Shin predicted, and I had prepared a condition for becoming their mentor.

<b>

"That is—"

<b>

I raised the corners of my mouth and began explaining the plan I had devised in my mind.
