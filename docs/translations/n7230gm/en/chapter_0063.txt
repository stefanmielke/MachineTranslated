# Idle Talk: Rough Hands

<b>

<b>

<b>

The martial arts tournament has ended, and the meeting with the Thunderbolt crew has also concluded successfully.

<b>

I am spending my days teaching them in a C-rank dungeon alongside Sera, Phenon, and Shiri. I am increasing my stock of elixirs in my spare time, but only a little.

<b>

There is no imminent crisis or event, so there is no need to rush leveling up. Even if I were to run around leveling up, the amount of elixirs available to the entire world wouldn’t drastically increase.

<b>

Of course, there are days when I rest my body and spend time lazily at home with my party members instead of going to the dungeon.

We often go shopping in town together as a group of four to buy ingredients and daily necessities.

<b>

As I spend these trivial days, my distance with Phenon has considerably shrunk. I think to myself that if I had a younger sister, it might have felt something like this. It’s a rather rude thought towards a princess—especially one who likes me.

<b>

When I first met her, she was kneeling with her head bowed. Now, including Sera and Shiri, we are in a semi-cohabitation state.

<b>

“Look, I’m going to leave you behind.”

<b>

I said while extending my hand to Phenon, who was captivated by a food stall.

She took my hand with a smile, saying, “I’m sorry,” and apologized to Sera.

<b>

Today, Shiri seems to have been called to the royal castle and is absent, so it’s just the three of us—Sera, Phenon, and me—out in the town.

<b>

Phenon is styled with her usual black hair, while Sera and I are in our usual attire. We can head to the dungeon at any time.

<b>

Not long after the martial arts tournament ended, I was stared at by people in the streets, asked for handshakes, and had requests for autographs, which felt nice for a bit, but it quickly became a hassle.

<b>

I’m not sure if that emotion showed on my face or if everyone’s enthusiasm had cooled down, but gradually, fewer people began to look our way.

<b>

“Leaving Sera aside, doesn’t Lord SR buy casual clothes?”

<b>

Phenon, walking to my right, lightly held my hand and asked.

<b>

Casual clothes, huh… I buy underwear and innerwear as needed, but I don’t have any clothes that seem like proper outerwear. The reason is quite simple: I don’t feel the need for them.

<b>

I understand that Phenon is talking about clothes that lack cutting resistance or magical resistance, but since I go to dungeons far more often than I go out into town, when I hear “clothes,” I immediately think of them as equipment. My casual wear is battle attire.

<b>

“What do you mean by ‘leaving aside’? I have plenty of casual clothes myself.”

<b>

“But Sera, you don’t wear them even if you buy them.”

<b>

“—Ugh… It can’t be helped since there aren’t many opportunities to wear them, right?”

<b>

“I think today is one of those ‘opportunities,’ though?”

<b>

“Well, that’s because… I’m also acting as a bodyguard—”

<b>

“Do you think there’s anyone in this town with the courage to attack Sera or Lord SR? Do you think anyone could win?”

<b>

Under the barrage of questions from Phenon, Sera fell silent. She was completely outmatched. She’s five years younger than me, after all.

<b>

Caught between the two, I watched the unfolding situation with a wry smile— or so I intended, but

<b>

“It would be a waste since it’s a date.”

<b>

Phenon’s words changed the plans.

<b>

“Wha—when did it become a date!? We’re just wandering around town while shopping for daily necessities!”

<b>

“If a man and a woman are holding hands and walking around town, that’s already a date, Lord SR.”

<b>

It might look that way from the outside!

If I were to view the current situation from behind objectively, I might just pull out my red sword from my inventory!

<b>

As I was about to weave words of denial, I noticed Sera looking at me with eyes devoid of spirit. Her gaze was fixed on the right hand I was holding with Phenon.

<b>

“If that’s the case, then only Phenon and the others are on a date. I’m just a nuisance.”

<b>

I stopped, letting out a self-deprecating laugh with eyes like a dead fish.

Phenon turned back and said, “That’s not true,” but I wondered if it even registered in her mind.

<b>

Even among men, when three of us hang out, this kind of dynamic often occurs. I reflected on how I was always the one left out in the past.

<b>

The more people there are around, the easier it is to feel lonely.

I understand that feeling painfully well, Sera. I’ve experienced it countless times.

<b>

“What are you saying, you fool? You’re not a nuisance at all.”

<b>

After experiencing that multiple times, I ultimately reached the conclusion that “it’s okay to be alone from the start.” I didn’t want Sera to think that way.

Even if she is a resident of a game world, Sera is now my precious companion. No objections allowed.

<b>

I extended my free left hand toward her.

<b>

Even if she were to reject me, it would only shatter my mental state. No problem.

<b>

“Come on, let’s go, Sera.”

<b>

She briefly looked up at me with wide eyes, then shrank back in fear, staring intently at my hand.

<b>

“—B-but, my hands are rough…”

<b>

She said that while tracing her right palm with her left index finger. It was a subtle movement, as if she was checking the sensation or feeling shy.

<b>

After waiting for about thirty seconds for a change, there was no sign of progress from her fidgeting state.

<b>

Alright, I’ll just go for it! Don’t say it’s sexual harassment later! Even if I get sued, I’ll appeal!

<b>

“What’s wrong with that? I’m not trying to enjoy the sensation or anything.”

<b>

Half-forcedly,

<b>

“Ah—no, um…”

<b>

As I grabbed Sera’s right hand, she instantly became as docile as a borrowed cat. There was no sign of her trying to pull away, and she looked down, her ears turning red.

<b>

As for Phenon, she was watching our interaction with a happy expression, not feeling jealous at all.

<b>

I’ve thought for a while now, but perhaps Phenon is executing a “let’s marry Lord SR together with my good friend Sera” plan? Please ignore the naming.

<b>

If I think about it that way, I can understand the meaning behind her actions and expressions until now, but I have no idea if that’s the truth. I have no intention of questioning it, so I guess I’ll never know. That’s fine by me.

<b>

Walking with Phenon happily waving my hand and Sera hurriedly re-gripping my hand as it almost slipped away.

<b>

<b>

I felt the warmth of the two from both hands while looking up at the endlessly blue sky and thought.

<b>

I should be careful on the night roads—
