# A-35 The Final Foe

<b>

<b>

After conquering the S-rank dungeon, I returned home to the party house in the royal capital with my companions.

I had informed the knights that I would be staying in the royal capital for a while, so they should come to my house if there were any audiences or new information. I had no urgent matters to attend to, so I planned to enjoy my last moments of peace.

<b>

That night, while having a relaxed conversation with Thunderbolt about "It's going to be tough from now on" and "Right?" the Vinzet siblings appeared in a fluster. Somehow, the rumor of our conquest of the S-rank dungeon had already spread throughout the royal capital, and they rushed over, thinking it was unbelievable.

Well, I had told you that you would eventually conquer it too, so there's no need to panic―― I thought, but since Arnold brought celebratory drinks, a quiet family party was held, albeit late at night. As usual, Sera was tipsy.

<b>

Then, a few days later.

<b>

Thunderbolt seemed to be motivated by my achievement, diving into dungeons without rest to level up. I don't know if he wants to catch up to me quickly or if he doesn't want to fall further behind, but I hope he takes care not to overdo it.

<b>

As for me, who is at the center of the problem,

<b>

"Still no information... Is it really true that the SS-rank―― the Demon King's Castle isn't appearing?"

<b>

I had a spoon prepared for mixing my tea in my mouth, swinging it up and down. While doing that, I rested my chin on the dining table, and Sera, sitting across from me, started doing the same thing. She was moving her spoon with a very happy expression.

<b>

"They said the audience would be tomorrow, so maybe they'll mention it then?"

<b>

Fenon, sitting next to Sera, glanced at me and Sera before speaking. Then, she also put a spoon in her mouth and was about to rest her chin when she was scolded by Shiri.

Right. It's bad manners, isn't it? I'll stop too.

<b>

"However, it seems there are no such rumors among the populace. If a new dungeon had appeared, it would be difficult to hide, and we would likely hear about it from somewhere."

<b>

"Yeah. It might be boring for you, big brother, but there's nothing we can do."

<b>

"Hmm... It's not decided yet. If it were to appear near the border, it would take time for search and movement."

<b>

"It seems they have ordered each town to search, and there are communication magical tools, right? If it appeared in a place that could be hidden, it wouldn't be surprising if information hasn't spread, but once a dungeon appears, it will definitely catch someone's eye. You can't keep a lid on people's mouths, so there probably isn't anything after all?"

<b>

"I had a faint feeling about it! But stop hitting me with logic! Give me some hope!"

<b>

"D-Don't worry, Esuar! There might be a dungeon inside a building! If that's the case, it wouldn't be surprising if no one noticed it!"

<b>

"Haha... That's quite a compact dungeon."

<b>

I chuckled at Sera's words, which weren't really comforting, and slumped back in my chair.

If nothing appears like this, it would be a serious case of indigestion. I had finally obtained the pinnacle of the Sword Saint's martial arts...

<b>

It's like defeating the Four Heavenly Kings who protect the Demon King, only to have the game end right there. Wait, where's the boss? Is it over with a mid-boss?

<b>

Since I conquered the S-rank dungeon, my tension has been dropping endlessly day by day.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

And then, on the day of the audience.

Fenon, as the First Princess, and her dedicated maid Shiri had already headed to the royal castle before me.

<b>

As for me, I was being rocked in a luxurious carriage that had come from the royal castle, accompanied by Sera and Noah as my guards. There were several knights accompanying us as guards, and the treatment was surprisingly polite. It was clear that I was being recognized as an important person more than ever.

<b>

However, the place we were heading to was not the royal castle, but the arena where martial arts tournaments are held. The reason for this was that they wanted to confirm something before I entered the castle.

<b>

Could it be that there’s a dungeon inside the arena――!? I thought, but it seemed that wasn't the case.

As we got out of the carriage and walked toward the arena, Sera placed her hand on her chin in thought.

<b>

"By the way, I can't believe there's a barrier set up in the arena... What could that possibly mean?"

<b>

Yes. The reason we were called to the arena was to confirm the barrier that had suddenly appeared, covering the stage.

<b>

"They said it appeared just around the time big brother conquered the S-rank dungeon, so it doesn't seem unrelated... but I don't know."

<b>

"I don't think I can figure anything out by going there."

<b>

Muttering to myself, I was actually a bit excited about this extraordinary situation. This world itself is extraordinary to me!

<b>

As we were guided and approached the stage in the center of the arena, I could indeed see that the stage was covered by a thin, rainbow-colored membrane, just as the knight had said. It was translucent like a soap bubble, but there was nothing on the stage.

<b>

"We are unable to do anything about this, but since you, Lord Esuar, have conquered the S-rank dungeon, we thought something might change... so we brought you here. If possible, we would like you to mention this during the audience as well."

<b>

The knight straightened his posture and said with a furrowed brow, looking quite helpless.

<b>

"Well, even if you say that..."

<b>

I don't know anything about this phenomenon either.

Scratching my head, I approached the stage to touch the barrier. Just as I reached out to touch the rainbow-colored wall, I heard a familiar voice from behind me saying, "Ah."

<b>

I wondered what it was―― and turned around. Sera was moving her mouth in surprise while pointing her index finger toward the arena.

<b>

"Something came out――"

<b>

I couldn't finish the last word, and I froze at the sight before me.

<b>

In front of me―― above the arena, five black silhouettes had appeared out of nowhere.

No, that description is a bit off. Five people, completely black from their toes to their heads, including their weapons and clothing, were standing lined up above the arena.

<b>

"......Hey, hey, hey."

<b>

I instinctively took a step back and muttered in disbelief. Cold sweat trickled down my cheeks, and the corners of my mouth turned upward.

I wasn't surprised because they looked like some kind of criminal.

I didn't think they were ghosts either.

I wasn't afraid of some unknown entity.

<b>

Even if I couldn't see their faces, even if their entire bodies were black, I understood from the shapes of the weapons and armor they wore―― their physiques.

<b>

"――This might be a bit dangerous."

<b>

I wouldn't mistake them; they were―― the unmovable number one in the Tempest party rankings, the "Moon" party.
