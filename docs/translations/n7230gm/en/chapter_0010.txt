# 9 I Dislike You

<b>

<b>

<b>

Currently, I and Sera-san had arrived at an E-rank dungeon located a ten-minute walk from the royal capital.

<b>

There was nothing around, just the dungeon standing alone.

Its appearance was similar to that of an F-rank dungeon, resembling a temple surrounded by stone walls. Since it was a bit far from the city, a portable toilet had also been set up near the reception.

<b>

In front of the dungeon, I could see a few explorers who were about to head in for exploration. Most likely, most of the explorers were already inside the dungeon.

<b>

Huh? A conversation with Sera-san on the way? There's no way that happened.

<b>

After all, the moment I stepped out of the explorer guild, I was declared that "I have no intention of having any conversation other than the bare minimum."

<b>

I'm not particularly good at communication, so I could only nod and say, "Understood." One reason for this was that I didn't have the guts to oppose her.

<b>

"---Well then, I'm off. I'll probably be back in about two hours, so let's have lunch then."

<b>

Finally, I spoke to Sera-san in front of the dungeon's reception. She seemed to think this was a necessary conversation and responded honestly.

<b>

"---Hmph. Don't make me go through unnecessary trouble."

<b>

There were, of course, no words like "Have a good time."

<b>

If I hadn't provoked her before the match, would it have turned out differently?

...No, she seemed displeased with being assigned as my bodyguard from the start, so there wouldn't have been a cheerful send-off either way.

<b>

While glancing at the receptionist girl, who looked completely exhausted due to a letter acknowledging special exceptions and the appearance of a count's daughter, I replied to Sera-san.

<b>

"I understand. I have no intention of using communication magic tools. What will you do while you wait, Sera-san?"

<b>

Will she read? Or take a nap?

I thought to ask, but she turned away and took out an iron sword from her inventory. Then, she started practicing her swings a little distance away.

<b>

"…Alright, I see. This is what you call a useless conversation."

<b>

A sigh escaped me involuntarily.

The reason I didn't feel too bad about it was that Sera-san was showing her response through actions instead of words.

It seems she's not the type to completely ignore my questions. She must have a kind heart deep down.

<b>

Sera-san was diligently training, so I might as well hurry and conquer the E-rank dungeon.

The time was just past 11 o'clock. By the time I finished, both she and I would probably be hungry.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

An hour and a half had passed since I entered the E-rank dungeon.

<b>

As planned, I had cleared all five floors, leaving only the dungeon boss remaining.

Having defeated all the monsters on the fifth floor, I ignored the window displaying the options "Return" and "Challenge the Boss" and sat down to check my status.

The countdown timer displayed in the window still had eight minutes left, so I decided to relax until the last moment.

<b>

"My current level is 9... If I defeat the boss, I should reach level 10."

<b>

Once I reach level 10, my stats will finally increase.

If the game mechanics hold true, the stat that should increase is VIT.

<b>

This dungeon is of the desert type, with many monsters like scorpions, centipedes, and beetles appearing. By the way, the boss I'm about to challenge should be a gazelle monster, if my memory serves me right.

The gazelles that exist on Earth are deer-like creatures about 150 centimeters long, but the dungeon boss here is nearly 5 meters tall.

<b>

Its size is three times that of a real gazelle, and its charge using its horns is indeed a threat.

With my current stats, if I get hit in the wrong spot, it's entirely possible I could be sent to the afterlife in one blow.

Well, it's not that fast, and its action patterns are limited, so I shouldn't get hit.

<b>

As the timer reached one minute remaining, I touched "Challenge the Boss"—light enveloped me.

<b>

The scenery changed, and before me stood the dungeon boss glaring at me.

<b>

"Alright, my memory isn't too bad after all."

<b>

As expected, the dungeon boss took the form of a gazelle.

<b>

I had completely memorized its stats, but I couldn't cover all the dungeon monsters. I only remembered them because they were around the royal capital.

<b>

Holding a short sword in my right hand, I slowly closed the distance step by step.

When I got within ten meters, the gazelle monster let out a roar that shook the ground, "Bwoooaaah!!"

<b>

Then, it charged toward me, kicking up sand.

<b>

"I've seen that move before—!"

<b>

I shifted my weight to the right and crouched to avoid the threatening horns. Using my crouched legs as a spring, I leaped to the right front and swung my sword at the monster's left front leg.

<b>

"That’s tough!"

<b>

I must have dealt some damage. However, the wound seemed shallow.

The monster turned to face me, and as if my attack hadn't even landed, it raised both of its front legs high and slammed them down with force.

<b>

"---Whoa!"

<b>

I dodged it simply by changing the direction of my body. The wound from earlier appeared right in front of me, and I took a step back while swinging my sword at that spot again.

<b>

"Bwoooaah!"

<b>

The sound coming from the monster was likely a cry of pain.

Alright, it's definitely working. Hitting the same spot seems to result in different damage.

<b>

The gazelle monster continued to attack by swinging its head and charging with its horns, and kicking with its hind legs, but I dodged all of them while persistently slashing the same spot.

Finally, the monster could no longer stand properly on its four legs.

<b>

"Alright, this should be easy now."

<b>

With the monster unable to attack properly, I confidently aimed for its vital spots like the neck.

Twenty minutes after the battle began—the monster dissolved into particles and disappeared.

<b>

"Phew... Without VIT, I really get tired. For now, it's a complete victory."

<b>

As the monster vanished, I too was enveloped in light. Just like when I entered, my body had no injuries at all.

E-rank dungeon—conquered.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I exited the dungeon, Sera-san was still practicing her sword swings just as she had been when I entered. The only difference was that sweat was now beading on her forehead, and her movements had become sluggish.

Well, if you practice for two hours, that's bound to happen.

<b>

"Thank you for waiting. You’re sweating a lot, but... Shall we take a bath to wash off the sweat before our meal?"

<b>

As I said this, she shot me her usual harsh glare.

<b>

"…Did you conquer it?"

<b>

"Yes. So, what do you want to do? There are dining places near the public bath in the royal capital—oh, or do you want to go home first?"

<b>

In response to my question, she took out a towel from her inventory and answered shortly, "Not necessary." Wiping the sweat from her forehead with the towel, she continued speaking.

<b>

"I dislike you. Therefore, I don't want to face you while eating. If you want to eat at a restaurant, do it alone."

<b>

Sera-san said this in a flat tone without looking at me.

<b>

How should I put it? Being told so directly that "I dislike you" might be a first-time experience for me.

In companies, it was always indirect insults, harassment, and roundabout ways.

<b>

"I see, then I'll just grab a sandwich or something and make do. After that, I'll continue to dive into the dungeon until just before the entry limit, so please buy some food with that in mind, Sera-san."

<b>

"Hmph—if that’s the case, you should have bought your meal beforehand. Don’t make me go through unnecessary trouble."

<b>

"Huh? Either way, to go to the dungeon, we have to pass through the royal capital, right?"

<b>

At my words, she tilted her head while glaring at me, making a rather silly gesture. Is that expression permanently fixed on her face?

<b>

"Are you going to a different dungeon? The other E-rank dungeons are quite far away. I don’t want to make you go through too much trouble—" "We’re going to a D-rank dungeon." "What did you say?"

<b>

"That's right, we're heading to a D-rank dungeon. There's a D-rank dungeon on the west side, across the royal capital from here, right? After buying food, we'll head there."

<b>

For the first time, her expression changed from anger to astonishment.

<b>

"---What! Do you want to die!? You're still only around level 10 of a low-tier class, right!? You might have managed here, but a D-rank dungeon is reckless!"

<b>

Suddenly, she grabbed my shoulders with both hands and shook me violently.

<b>

"---C-Could you please stop?"

<b>

"Do you understand!? It's like going to commit suicide!"

<b>

"It hurts! It really hurts!"

<b>

With my brain and shoulders screaming, I instinctively took a step back from Sera-san and got her to release my shoulders. She really has high STR, that's for sure.

<b>

"I-I’m fine. Besides, I proved that I can handle a D-rank dungeon by having a mock battle with you, a conqueror."

<b>

Perhaps remembering that she lost, her expression turned sulky again. I couldn't tell if she acknowledged me as strong, but she didn't retort.

<b>

Come to think of it, I've never seen Sera-san smile. She's always angry or sulky, and occasionally surprised.

Most of the reasons for that are me, though.

<b>

"……If the bodyguard's target dies, it would be a disgrace to the Bernot family."

<b>

"I'll communicate if it gets dangerous."

<b>

In balance with Sera-san's irritated face, I responded with a smile. Of course, she didn't return the smile and just turned her face away with a "Hmph."

<b>

<b>

And after lunch.

It took me about three hours, but I successfully conquered the D-rank dungeon as planned.
