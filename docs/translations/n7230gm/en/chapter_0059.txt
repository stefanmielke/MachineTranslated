# 57 Derivative Secondary Jobs VS 〇〇

<b>

<b>

Suzu threw the spear she had been holding into the sky and ran towards me with both hands hidden behind her body.

<b>

“How about this!”

<b>

When she was about five meters away from me, she thrust her glowing red right hand towards me with great force.

What she unleashed from her hand was the skill of a primary job, the magician—Projectile Magic.

<b>

Like in the VRMMO Tempest, magic in this world does not require lengthy incantations or the drawing of magic circles.

<b>

Just by concentrating—magic activates with just that.

<b>

To use magic, it requires about three seconds of "charging" time, and during that time, her hand continues to glow, making it difficult to catch someone off guard, even without incantations or magic circles. She likely hid her hand with her body to prevent me from noticing the magic until the last moment. However—

<b>

“That’s something even a kid could come up with.”

<b>

It’s a convenient technique that’s also used in ranking battles.

As I performed a backstep, I deflected the fire magic, the size of a tennis ball, approaching me at nearly 100 kilometers per hour with my sword.

While I would undoubtedly be unable to handle it with my eyes in the real world, with my vision in this world, the difficulty level drops to something akin to batting practice.

<b>

“—Tch.”

<b>

The one who clicked his tongue above me was Shin.

He had caught the spear thrown by Suzu in mid-air and was about to throw it at me. He had to deal with the incoming fire magic, causing his attack to fizzle out.

<b>

I moved directly beneath Shin, keeping an eye on Suzu, who was passed the spear from Shin, and Raika, who was watching for my opening, while dodging the sword that Shin swung down from above and quickly maneuvered behind him.

<b>

As soon as Shin landed, without giving him a moment to regain his stance, I grabbed his collar, swept his legs, and threw him with all my might towards Raika.

<b>

“—Kya!”

<b>

Raika, using her whole body to catch Shin, let out a feminine voice before falling on her backside. “Sorry,” Shin apologized, while Raika quickly stood up, saying, “Don’t worry about it.”

<b>

The Thunderbolt Trajectory had not given up yet. It seemed they were still searching for a way to defeat me.

I wanted to highly evaluate their positive attitude. I hope they can keep fighting until the end.

<b>

<b>

Ten minutes, twenty minutes—thirty minutes passed.

<b>

In my mind, the Thunderbolt Trajectory had an image of a classic—beautiful fight, but they had shown me a truly muddy battle. I’m not criticizing; I’m praising.

Their determination to win by any means necessary and to use every tactic to aim for victory is very admirable.

<b>

The damage I inflicted on them was being healed by Suzu when she found an opening, but fatigue was surely accumulating.

However, rather than slowing down, their movements were gradually becoming more refined.

<b>

“Getting stronger in battle, what kind of protagonist are you…?”

<b>

If that’s the case, then I’m in the role of the antagonist. I had completely underestimated them, and I think it’s only natural that it turned out this way.

<b>

As I was engaged in a clash with Shin, who was attacking me with an illusionary sword, he said in a strained voice.

<b>

“Didn’t you want to stay out of the spotlight? It feels a bit too late for that, though.”

<b>

Since I was putting all my strength into my arms like Shin, I replied with a trembling voice.

<b>

“I, forgot.”

<b>

“I thought so.”

<b>

With a sudden surge of strength, I couldn’t hold on and stepped back. I continued to backstep, creating distance from Shin.

Behind Shin, Raika was receiving healing from Suzu for the damage she had taken from my palm strike.

<b>

Now, how should I conclude this?

<b>

I had thought that simply enduring Shin and the others' attacks would suffice, but upon further reflection, that wouldn’t end the match.

<b>

Winning is a problem, and losing is undesirable. A draw would be the best outcome, but it seems difficult for all four of us to fall outside the ring together, so what should I do?

<b>

As I realized the naivety of my plan, a deep voice called out, “Stop! Stop it, you guys!” Regulus, who was serving as the referee, walked towards us with heavy footsteps.

<b>

“How long do you plan to keep this up!? You’ve been at it for nearly two hours!”

<b>

“Eh…? Has it really been that long?”

<b>

“I didn’t notice. I thought it was only about an hour.”

<b>

Shin and I lowered our swords and looked at Regulus, who had a frown on his face.

<b>

“If it seemed like the match was about to conclude, I wouldn’t stop you, but there’s no sign of that at all. You guys don’t intend to finish this, do you? Plus, we can’t keep the royal family here forever.”

<b>

The latter part of his statement was said quietly so only we could hear.

Indeed, that makes some sense. While there are people who enjoy watching such battles, there are also those who might find it boring. There must have been some who wished for it to end quickly. Thinking about the possibility of someone from the royal family being among that type—never mind, I won’t think about it.

<b>

“What’s wrong?”

<b>

“Is something happening?”

<b>

With Regulus interrupting, the match was paused, and Raika and Suzu approached with puzzled expressions. Shin answered, “He says the match is too long.”

<b>

“That’s right—due to the time limit, the match between Thunderbolt Trajectory and SR will be declared a draw!”

<b>

Regulus shouted loudly without giving us a chance to refuse.

No, you didn’t mention anything about a time limit during the rules explanation. While I have no intention of disputing it since it’s beneficial for me, still.

<b>

Just after the signal for the end of the match was given, a thunderous cheer rained down on us.

<b>

It seems some people are shouting, but with so many voices mixed together, I can’t grasp it as language. However, from the atmosphere of the voices, I can predict that they are words of praise rather than jeers. I hope it’s not just wishful thinking.

<b>

In sync with Thunderbolt Trajectory waving to the crowd, I also waved to the audience. I felt somewhat like an idol. The cheers seemed to grow louder. I hope that’s not just wishful thinking either.

<b>

By the way, I can see a banner that says “Long Live the Hero!”… When did they make that? Please, spare me from that. It’s too embarrassing.

<b>

“SR, are you going to use a potion? You’ve taken a few hits, and if necessary, I can heal you too.”

<b>

Amidst the unending cheers, Suzu approached me and offered such kind words. Being able to have this kind of exchange with my opponent is thanks to the fact that it was a good match. However, that consideration is unnecessary.

<b>

“Thanks, but I can handle this much on my own, so it’s no problem.”

<b>

I declined her offer and placed my hand on the painful areas of my body to activate Heal. A soft light enveloped the affected areas, easing the pain.

<b>

As I basked in the gentle warmth of my own magic, I locked eyes with Shin.

He had a frown, with his eyes and mouth wide open, looking like something a handsome guy shouldn’t be doing.

<b>

“Y-You, Heal…?”

<b>

“H-Hey, SR, what’s your current job? What kind of job were we fighting against?”

<b>

Following Shin, Raika asked with a trembling voice.

Now that I think about it, I hadn’t mentioned what job I was using in the match. I had planned to say it later, but even if I said it here, the audience probably wouldn’t notice.

<b>

I displayed the menu screen and adjusted my body so they could see it.

<b>

“I’m a priest.”

<b>

A primary job, specializing in healing. A complete backline job that only has Heal as its merit.

Thunderbolt Trajectory, seeing the window, seemed to collapse to the ground with a sound that could be described as “kote—”.

<b>

Did they think they were having a fair fight against me? Unfortunately, that thought is naïve.

At least for now, I am stronger than them. I wouldn’t say I’m far above them, but I’m strong enough that even with a handicap, I wouldn’t lose.

<b>

I hope they continue to aim higher so that one day they can have an equal fight against me when I take on an attacking job.
