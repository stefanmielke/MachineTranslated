# A-61 The Inhumanity of Esuar

<b>

<b>

<b>

Neska-san, along with Nīzu-kun, has successfully conquered an A-rank dungeon.

The boss battle at A-rank ended without any significant issues, with only Sera and Neska-san sustaining minor injuries. With this, the two from the Palmour Kingdom have safely obtained their tickets to the S-rank dungeon.

<b>

Although it was their first experience conquering an A-rank dungeon, their reactions were quite contrasting and interesting.

Neska-san appeared very excited, saying, "I will share the information with the party members!" and was in a good mood throughout. For now, I haven't announced anything about the player bonuses, so I told her to "wait for further news." If her stats increase, her party will surely be able to clear dungeons more easily.

It's not advisable to push themselves too hard right now. I recommended leveling up their secondary derived classes.

<b>

Now, about Nīzu-kun.

He seemed tired from the unfamiliar dungeon, and apparently had paperwork waiting for him, muttering, "I need to gather some information while I can..."

Unfortunately, unlike the B-rank dungeon, there is no escort this time, so it seems he has to handle it himself. Well, our ASR team and Neska-san will cooperate later, so it shouldn't be a problem. I also managed to completely recall the A-rank dungeon after a long time.

<b>

<b>

And today――we have arrived at the S-rank dungeon.

<b>

"Leave this dungeon to me."

<b>

The boss of this S-rank dungeon in the Palmour Kingdom is a nine-tailed fox. It's a huge monster with an unusually high number of tails.

This boss spits out bluish-white flames like a gatling gun and has extremely high MND—magic defense—so it takes time to challenge it with magic classes. Even if one fights using the magic sword, Byakuren, the enemy is tough enough that its effects are hardly felt. However, if one fights with STR at the SSS level, it shouldn't be too difficult.

<b>

"You will choose the Sword Saint as your class, right?"

<b>

After surveying the grassland dungeon under the sunset sky, Sera spoke up.

<b>

"Yeah. Since Nīzu-kun and Neska-san are here, I want to be cautious."

<b>

"Then wouldn't the Conqueror be better?"

<b>

Hmm.

It seems that in Sera's mind, the equation of 'Conqueror = strongest' is established. While it's true that the Conqueror is strong, it's not necessarily the best choice upon closer examination.

<b>

"Indeed, in terms of overall strength, the Conqueror is superior, but for a focused physical attack, the Sword Saint is better. The firepower is different."

<b>

The Conqueror has all S stats, but the Sword Saint can boost STR and AGI to SSS with equipment stat increases. Using magic skills against an opponent with high magic defense is inefficient, so to defeat the enemy safely, I chose the Sword Saint this time.

<b>

I spoke to Neska-san, who was gripping her sword and on high alert, in a light tone to ease the tension.

<b>

"The Sword Saint can acquire extremely useful skills at level 100, so please make sure to level up to the cap, Neska-san."

<b>

"Hahaha... Considering how much harder it is to level up compared to secondary classes, it feels like a daunting task... but I'll do my best."

<b>

I inadvertently lowered the mood even further. My bad.

<b>

"Big bro! You probably already sensed it with your detection, but enemies are approaching! We'll focus on protection, so please be careful not to get caught in the crossfire!"

<b>

Noah, who was standing by Nīzu-kun, called out in her usual carefree tone, showing no signs of tension.

<b>

"Understood. Sorry to leave you bored, but I'll enjoy myself."

<b>

After all, I'm familiar with S-rank dungeons, so I'm looking forward to it.

The enemies are also quite challenging.

<b>

"Yeah, have fun! Sera and I will probably be busy explaining things to you two, so we might not be that bored~"

<b>

Ah, I see.

It is indeed the enemies of an S-rank dungeon that we are encountering for the first time, so explanations might be needed.

What characteristics does that monster have――and what should we be careful about? Including myself, there is probably no one more knowledgeable about this world than Noah. I'm not even sure if Noah can be considered human.

<b>

～Noah's side～

<b>

"It's so fast that it's all I can do to keep up with it... It's strange to say this, but I feel pity for the monsters."

<b>

"My husband has trained himself to the extreme. When he walks through the city, he appears to be just a very cool young man, but when facing enemies, he seems like a being from another dimension."

<b>

In response to Neska's comment, Sera casually mixed in a compliment.

How nice for Sera. She gets to marry big bro.

I'm still being considerate of my girlfriend and Phenon, but eventually, I need to make my move to become big bro's bride too. I guess Shiri will be with me then.

<b>

"Does Esuar-kun have eyes on the back of his head? I feel like he avoided that last attack without even looking."

<b>

The first prince Nīzu, who was watching big bro's battle beside me, asked me that.

<b>

"That was based on predicting the enemy's movements just before the attack. It's more like a level of future prediction than mere anticipation. It's not that he can see it."

<b>

Since I'm also allowed to speak casually with big bro, I don't hold back. After all, I was once a god. It's understandable to use formal language to get by, but the only one I truly respect is probably Lady Idea.

<b>

Hearing my words, Nīzu tilted his head, saying, "Isn't that already quite inhuman?"

<b>

Currently, we have reached the third floor, but their questions are mostly about big bro rather than the monsters. If a fellow human were making movements beyond comprehension, it would definitely be intriguing.

<b>

"There has never been, nor will there ever be, anyone as amazing as big bro. I can say that with certainty."

<b>

That's why big bro was summoned by me and is living in this world.
