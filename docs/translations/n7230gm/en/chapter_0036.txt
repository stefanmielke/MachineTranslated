# 34 Future Plans

<b>

<b>

<b>

There are 2 days left until the announcement of the derived secondary jobs.

<b>

Since I assigned new missions to Shin and the others until today, I've been diving into B-rank dungeons every day to relieve the stress I accumulated from meetings. Thanks to that, my inventory has a decent quantity of elixirs.

So even if an unexpected situation arises, I can rest easy.

<b>

When we were discussing the new rules, I was home by 9 PM at the latest, but recently I've been diving into dungeons until after midnight. Because of that, I haven't seen Fenon-san, Shiri-san, or Sera for the past few days.

<b>

I feel sorry for Fenon-san, who wanted to see me, but I really wanted to level up. Please forgive me.

<b>

And today.

Since my desires had calmed down a bit, I was lounging at home until Fenon-san and the others arrived.

<b>

First, Sera arrived around 9:30, turning the doorknob noisily without knocking or calling out. Then she entered the house as if it were her own.

<b>

Huh? I had locked the door, though?

<b>

When I go out, I don't lock the door, thinking that the maid will come to clean anyway, but that's not the case when I'm home.

<b>

When I hurriedly questioned her, it turned out that she had been given a key to this house by Fenon-san. Since I originally got the house for free, I couldn't strongly assert, "This is my house!" and just said, "At least knock, will you?"

This is where I live, and it's not just a gathering place.

<b>

Then, Fenon-san and the others arrived around 10. After welcoming the two into the house, I had them sit on the sofa across from me.

<b>

I spoke up so that everyone sitting on the sofa could hear me about our future plans.

<b>

"We plan to mainly operate in C-rank dungeons, but before that, we'll go to a B-rank dungeon."

<b>

Sera is sitting next to me.

Across from me are Fenon-san and Shiri-san.

<b>

By the way, Shiri-san had stubbornly refused to sit on the sofa, but with Fenon-san's words, "Right now, we are explorers. Our status doesn't matter," she reluctantly sat down.

<b>

"B-rank dungeon, you say? Not D-rank?"

<b>

She probably thought she misheard. Fenon-san tilted her head and asked. I nodded and replied, "Yes."

<b>

"For a while—let's say at least for a month, I will carry you all. It's for safety, so please understand."

<b>

To carry means that I will be the one to clear the dungeon alone, and everyone will just receive the experience points. It's a common sight in games to carry beginners.

<b>

"I can fight in a B-rank dungeon, you know?"

<b>

"I want to assign two bodyguards to Sera. It would be dangerous if I missed a monster."

<b>

"Hmph—it's hard to imagine you missing a monster, Esuaar."

<b>

"It's just for safety. After all, I'm responsible for the princess's life, so being overly cautious is just right."

<b>

At my words, Sera nodded, saying, "I see."

<b>

"—If that's the case, I understand. I won't be bored talking with Fenon, and with Shiri here, I won't get tired of watching Esuaar fight."

<b>

"Sorry, but this is also for Sera and the others, you know?"

<b>

"I understand."

<b>

Reacting to our conversation, Shiri-san murmured, "Huh? Is going to a B-rank dungeon cautious? Huh?" but perhaps sensing the atmosphere around her, she straightened up and closed her mouth.

<b>

<b>

I had been thinking the whole time while diving into the dungeon.

<b>

While Shiri-san had been active as an explorer, Fenon-san had zero combat experience. Despite that, if she were to act in the dungeon with me, it would involve considerable danger.

<b>

So I decided to raise their statuses above the borderline that Tempest's management had mentioned.

That way, even if they were to receive an attack, it wouldn't lead to a situation where they would be mortally wounded in one hit.

<b>

"However, Fenon-san and Shiri-san will start in two days. Today and tomorrow, I'll be boosting Sera's abilities."

<b>

"...Mine?"

<b>

With a puzzled expression, Sera pointed to her own face.

She probably didn't think she would be the one being carried.

<b>

"Yeah. Even if I'm protecting Fenon-san and the others, it's a waste to dive with a class that has already gained experience—no, I mean, status bonuses. I'll lightly boost your stats so that even a level 1 derived advanced class won't be a problem. I also want to increase the options for advanced classes."

<b>

"But even if you say to level up, we only have two days, right?"

<b>

When Sera tilted her head in confusion, Fenon-san and Shiri-san also seemed curious about my response and focused their gazes on me.

<b>

Hmm.

It seems they are underestimating how easily first-class jobs can level up.

<b>

My answer will likely far exceed their expectations.

<b>

Imagining their reactions to what I was about to say made me unable to help but grin.

With a mischievous smile, I said to Sera,

<b>

"Well, with two days, you can level up four lower classes—specifically for Sera, that's the brawler, knight, cleric, and mage. All of them can be raised to level 30."

<b>

"What!? Fenon took nearly eight days to level up one lower class!? To do four in two days—no way, that's just impossible!"

<b>

As expected, she was surprised.

<b>

"Well, if you level up in a D-rank dungeon, that's about right."

<b>

Fenon-san had originally raised her cleric advanced class to level 40 due to the kingdom's intentions.

However, since she had zero practical experience, I had no choice but to send her to a D-rank dungeon that Sera could handle comfortably.

<b>

"I can now clear a B-rank dungeon twice in one day. If two people dive, it's just enough for one round to raise a first-class job's level to 30."

<b>

I often saw other players doing that in games. I never did it myself.

I don't like relying on others, and I don't particularly enjoy being relied upon either.

<b>

"Why would you do that—... No, never mind. Forget it."

<b>

She probably recalled when I said before that I "had no intention of talking." I simply replied, "Sure."

<b>

Across from me, Shiri-san was astonished, saying, "Two rounds of B-rank!?" Even her surprised face was beautiful.

<b>

"—Well, that's why we'll start with Fenon-san and the others in two days. Although, like with Sera, it will just be waiting."

<b>

"Since we can see Esuaar-sama's brave figure up close, there can be no complaints. Right, Shiri?"

<b>

With a slightly pressured voice, Fenon-san said to Shiri-san next to her.

Hadn't she just said something about "status not mattering"? I felt a pressure from authority.

As for Shiri-san, she seemed completely unaware of the pressure from the princess beside her and said with a smile, "I'll learn from you."

<b>

"Let's discuss which classes to level up at that time."

<b>

"Understood. I will do my best to be of assistance to Esuaar-sama."

<b>

"I'll do my best too!"

<b>

Fenon-san smiled, and Shiri-san made a small fist pump.

<b>

As for Sera,

<b>

"I have to do my best too..."

<b>

Unlike the two, she was looking down with a serious expression.

This seems to be related to some issues within her family. Just my guess, though.

<b>

Did something happen? If you want to talk, I'm here for you.

I couldn't say such considerate words.

<b>

I was worried that it might be a bother if I asked, and I was scared of receiving a response like "just leave me alone." I also thought that I shouldn't casually poke into family matters.

<b>

I'm not particularly good at socializing, and even less so with women.

<b>

"Hey, let's do our best together."

<b>

For now, I cheerfully called out. For me, this was quite an effort.

<b>

While looking at her wry smile, I was internally troubled about what to do.
