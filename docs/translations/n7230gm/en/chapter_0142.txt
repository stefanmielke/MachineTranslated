# A-28 Summons

<b>

<b>

<b>

While eagerly waiting for our new home to be completed, we went about our daily lives as usual.

<b>

The only change was that I went on dungeon dates with the other three members, excluding Noah.

This was a promise made after the other members protested that it was unfair for Noah to go to the dungeon alone with me.

<b>

Well, it was incredibly fun.

The attitude and atmosphere were different when I was with everyone and when it was just the two of us, which made it feel very refreshing.

<b>

Also, until now, we had been allowed to skip showing our licenses when entering the dungeon thanks to Regulus's influence, but I officially informed the guild that I had cleared an A-rank dungeon and showed my license's clearance history as proof.

<b>

Of course, since our professions still can't be revealed, I continued to refuse to show them when entering the dungeon.

<b>

"Being summoned by His Majesty... I wonder what it's about."

<b>

In our house near the city of Reinas.

I muttered this while looking at the members gathered in the living room.

<b>

Just a few minutes ago, a knight had come to our house and left a message from His Majesty.

<b>

It said that he wanted the members of ASR to come to the royal capital.

The date was ten days later. And that day, coincidentally, was also the day we would receive the keys to our new home.

<b>

"Could it be about clearing the A-rank dungeon, our new home, or perhaps a discussion about new servants?"

<b>

"There might be a possibility of a title as well. Not for individuals, but something like how the party was given the title 'Thunderbolt's Trail.'"

<b>

"Perhaps my father is trying to assess Esuar-san?"

<b>

"Hmm, any of those could be possible. ...Speaking of which, we haven't received our reward for the slayer quest yet."

<b>

Each of the four responded. All of them seemed plausible.

<b>

"Any of them could be possible. In any case, we won't know until we go."

<b>

"That's true. The knight didn't seem to know much either."

<b>

Noah, who had apparently been checking the knight's inner thoughts, said with a hint of disappointment.

<b>

"Well, considering it's His Majesty and Dino-sama, it shouldn't lead to anything strange. They're good people."

<b>

His Majesty was someone who, despite thinking I was just a useless person when I first arrived in this world, worried about me and even apologized for it.

Dino-sama is flexible when you talk to him properly and seems to genuinely consider our opinions.

<b>

"Hehe, that's true. Dino might actually be aware of the relationship between Esuar-san and us and is keeping it quiet."

<b>

That thought was somewhat frightening, as it felt like being watched. However, it seemed plausible for Dino-sama.

Perhaps when we head to the royal capital, I would be called into a separate room and subjected to some sort of interrogation by Dino-sama.

<b>

...Maybe I'm overthinking it.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

It turns out I wasn't overthinking.

<b>

"I apologize for taking your time, Esuar-dono."

<b>

"No, no, I have the whole day free, so it's not a problem."

<b>

In a room within the royal castle.

Come to think of it, this was the same room where I received the bracelet indicating my title when I cleared a B-rank dungeon. Back then, Thunderbolt's Trail and Sera were here, but now it's just me.

<b>

The servant who brought tea left quickly, and now it's just me and Dino-sama in this room. After our conversation, it seems I'll join everyone else for an audience with His Majesty.

<b>

"Now, since we have an audience with His Majesty coming up, I'll get straight to the point. The reason I called you alone, Esuar-dono, is that I wanted to ask about your relationship with Fenon-sama."

<b>

Oh wow. Right to the main topic.

I've had a few opportunities to meet Dino-sama before, but this is the first time I've received such a straightforward question. It might be better to think of this as a final confirmation rather than just a question.

<b>

"Well, as you might have guessed, Dino-sama... Did Fenon mention anything to you?"

<b>

Since the plan was to approach from the outside, there's a good chance Fenon was talking about me within the royal castle.

<b>

"Of course. Ninety percent of what Fenon-sama talked about was about you, Esuar-dono."

<b>

How much has he been talking about me?

Even if the plan was to approach from the outside, it felt like they were pouring concrete with a mixer to fill it in. It was too forceful.

<b>

"My guess is that you are in a romantic relationship with Fenon-sama, Sera-dono, and Shiri. What do you think?"

<b>

At this point, being so accurately pointed out, it seems impossible to dodge the question. Moreover, I don't really have a reason to hide it anymore.

<b>

"About Sera and Fenon, yes. As for Shiri, it's still... something like that."

<b>

"I see."

<b>

Dino-sama, resting his chin on his hand, didn't seem to express any outrage at my lack of restraint. Rather, it felt like he was considering it positively. I can only hope that it's not just wishful thinking.

<b>

"If possible, I would have liked to hear more about how you all met, but it seems difficult time-wise today. Personally, I think it would be a very happy thing if you are with someone like Esuar-dono."

<b>

Saying this, Dino-sama showed a gentle smile, creating wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. I held back the urge to sigh in relief and replied, "Thank you."

<b>

"The residents of the royal capital and Reinas have seen the close bond between the members of ASR and won't question it. However, to those who don't know anything, it would just look like a marriage between a commoner and royalty. —You understand what I'm trying to say, right?"

<b>

We need achievements that can convince those who don't know us well.

<b>

Convince them—huh.

<b>

...No, that's a passive way of thinking.

If I accept being treated specially, being treated as a curiosity, and being exposed to strange gazes, then I can cause as much commotion as I want.

I can show them battles that the residents of this world have never seen before during the Tempest era.

<b>

And even if those around me don't accept it, would I give up on them? No—it's not like that.

<b>

"Yes, of course. I intend to achieve what is necessary to convince those around me. However, if there are still those who refuse to accept it—"

<b>

I paused for a moment.

To infuse my next words with strong conviction.

<b>

"—I will convince them with my strength."

<b>

From now on, I will adopt the stance of "If you have complaints, come at me."

<b>
