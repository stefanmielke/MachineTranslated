# A-40 Combat Maniac, Once Again

<b>

<b>

Ten percent tension, ten percent anxiety of defeat――and then, eighty percent joy at being able to fight a strong opponent after a long time.

With such a biased mindset, I faced off against the clones of the strongest party in Tempest, known as 'Moon'.

<b>

The opponent's job composition consisted of one Demon Lord, one Saint, one Spirit Archer, and two Sword Saints.

Having trampled over renowned warriors and racing at the top, they were all at level 100, and naturally, they had acquired all status bonuses. In fact, that's generally the case for ranked players.

<b>

Before it started, I had fleeting thoughts like, "What if it turns into a one-sided match because of the cheat class of the Overlord?"――but that was a complete overreaction.

<b>

No, because.

The Overlord has no levels and fixed stats, and compared to the Demon Lord and Sword Saints, their stats are somewhat lower, but they can use unique ultimate skills like 'Gravity Magic' and 'Destruction Sword', not to mention skills like 'Master of Demons' and 'Pinnacle of Martial Arts'. There's no way they aren't strong.

<b>

So perhaps it might actually be easier than I thought…… I had that kind of thought. However, as soon as the match began, I realized within 0.1 seconds, "Ah, this is bad."

<b>

Yes, I only realized it after it started.

<b>

Since the match was decided, I had repeatedly simulated the fight against 'Moon' in my mind, having fought them many times in Tempest, and I had properly secured victories.

However, there was a clear difference between the ones I had seen in the game and this clone that was currently launching a fierce attack.

<b>

It wasn't because the clone lacked emotions――nor was it because they didn't make any sounds, making it difficult to communicate intentions between enemies――

――it was because the enemy was completely pitch black.

<b>

"Damn it…… it's hard to see. I wish at least the eyeballs had some color, you know, Miss Noja Loli."

<b>

That might be creepy in its own way.

<b>

With a backflip that was impossible for my physical abilities in my previous life, I dodged the magic and arrows that came flying at my feet, using that momentum to kick the Sword Saint who was charging at me toward the direction where the Saint was waiting.

I twisted my body while placing one hand on the ground, swinging my other hand with the White Lotus. The shining white short sword deflected the Destruction Sword activated by the other Sword Saint.

<b>

Even such relatively simple exchanges made me break out in a cold sweat.

<b>

I couldn't see the opponent's gaze.

I was surprised that I had been observing the enemy's eye movements up to this point.

<b>

Not being able to see the enemy's eye movements made it extremely difficult to read their attacks.

It was like a basketball game where all the ball exchanges were done without looking――if I had to describe it. In any case, their movements were hard to read.

Not only the places the enemy aimed for, but it seemed I was also reading emotions from their gaze, making it difficult to judge their intentions to attack, evade, or defend――all of those decisions became challenging.

<b>

"For now, I need to take my time to get used to this situation. Then I'll take down the Demon Lord and the Saint."

<b>

I boldly exposed my intentions while dodging attacks, thinking that the enemy's heads probably wouldn't understand words.

It seemed they had no intention of using items, so I should prioritize taking down those two who knew healing magic.

<b>

While clashing with the two Sword Saints, I kept a close watch on the movements of the three waiting behind me. It was too slow to look at each one individually, so I had to observe all three movements simultaneously, understand them at the same time, and find openings. Of course, that was just a side task; dealing with the Sword Saints in front of me was the priority.

<b>

"This is fun."

<b>

When I was having mock battles with Sera and the others, I had a lot of options to choose from. That was because the opponent was still inexperienced, allowing for multiple means to defeat them.

<b>

However, in the ranking battles of Tempest, it wasn't that easy. By connecting the best actions to the best outcomes, I could gradually turn the situation in my favor. And if I made even one mistake, all my efforts could be in vain in an instant, a constant tightrope walk.

<b>

What about now?

<b>

"First, the Guardian Barrier――"

<b>

I created a barrier between the two Sword Saints using the skill of the Barrier Mage. Although the barrier was destroyed in an instant, that brief moment expanded my range of actions infinitely. I retreated as if to jump back, then readied my stance.

<b>

"Next is Gravity Magic――followed by Binding Arrow."

<b>

Next, I activated the skills of the Demon Lord and the Spirit Archer in order. After hindering the movements of the two Sword Saints, I would capture them――if it went smoothly, that would be lucky, but of course, it wouldn't be that easy.

<b>

While dodging the incoming enemy magic, I lowered my head and dashed toward the direction where the Sword Saint had avoided my attack while losing their balance.

<b>

After slashing upward with the White Lotus,

<b>

"Defense Penetration――and"

<b>

I activated the skill of the Hero while bringing it down.

The Demon Lord's skill, Master of Demons. The Sage's skill, Body Enhancement. The Sword Saint's skill, Pinnacle of Martial Arts. And the damage, enhanced by the effect of the weapon, Shining White, struck the enemy's left shoulder.

<b>

While keeping the other Sword Saint at bay with the Destruction Sword, I tried to attack the damaged enemy in a flurry――

<b>

"You're not going to let me do that, are you?"

<b>

Suddenly, a Guardian Barrier appeared right in front of me. And then came the onslaught of Gravity Magic and Binding Arrows.

Interestingly, the skills the enemy unleashed were similar in structure to the ones I had used. Well, it's a common combination, after all.

<b>

I evaded the attacks while creating distance. Ah, they've healed.

<b>

As I let out a sigh and exhaled deeply, I felt a droplet pass by the corner of my eye. When I wiped that area with the back of my hand, it was red. It seemed that a part of the Binding Arrow had grazed my cheek.

<b>

"The area above my eyes is quite bothersome…… Heal."

<b>

If I took out a potion from my inventory and used it, I could recover without consuming magic power.

However, I chose not to. Even if others called it being cocky, I would accept it willingly.

<b>

"'Moon' without items, and me alone with items――that would be too anticlimactic."

<b>

Thanks to the Overlord class, I had infinite options for fighting.

Even I, who prided myself on being the best in Tempest, found myself overwhelmed by the vast amount.

<b>

"Now then, what shall I try next?"

<b>

The match had only just begun.

Ah, this is getting fun!!
