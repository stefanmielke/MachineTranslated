# A-45 Daze

<b>

A few days have passed since the match in the arena.

Although I had errands like visiting His Majesty and dropping by the Bernot family, I wasn't bound for long hours, and I was able to lead a relatively lazy life without going to the dungeon. Staying at home meant I didn't have to deal with the noisy ruckus outside.

<b>

Ah, of course, the main topic I discussed when summoned by my father-in-law was about marriage.

<b>

It seems the ceremony will be held simultaneously, and the schedule will be informed later.

Personally, I had hoped for a quiet wedding with just family, but since Fenon is a princess, I couldn't really voice such selfishness. I decided to take it as a good opportunity to show off my partner. After all, both of them are incredibly beautiful.

<b>

Once things settle down, which country should we visit?

While pondering this, I was sitting side by side with Noah on the sofa in the living room, slowly sipping coffee when we had a visitor.

<b>

"Hey, you're still holed up as usual, huh?"

<b>

The visitor was Shin, the leader of the Thunderbolt party.

It seems his two companions had gone out shopping, and he returned out of boredom.

I mean, they are also contributing money, and this is supposed to be the ASR and Thunderbolt party house, but... since they aren't home much, it feels like I'm hosting a guest.

Shin ordered tea from the maid Aine and sat down on the sofa opposite us.

<b>

"Isn't it fine? The arena is back to normal, and it doesn't seem like a rematch with 'The Moon' will happen anytime soon."

<b>

On the way back from meeting Fenon's parents, I went to the arena to check its condition. Unfortunately, it was completely back to normal. The barrier was gone, and when I stepped onto the stage, The Moon did not appear.

<b>

"Geez, were you planning to fight again if you could?"

<b>

"Of course, I'm confident I can do much better next time. Besides, an S-rank boss isn't really a match for me—by the way, you guys haven't been back for a few days. Where have you been wandering around?"

<b>

There are communication magical tools in this world, but the absolute number is low, so they aren't something individuals can easily own or use casually. I wish I had a smartphone, but the level of civilization is just too different, making it feel out of place.

<b>

"Ah. I went to another city with explorers from other countries and delved into dungeons. Fighting enemies that don't engage too much is refreshing and serves as training. We thought it would be a good opportunity to steal techniques, but compared to you, they just seem lacking. Everyone looks inefficient."

<b>

This guy... is he some kind of social monster...?

<b>

"Hmm... so that's what you were doing. I think it would be more efficient to defeat a lot of easier enemies quickly to level up."

<b>

When I replied like that, Noah, sitting next to me, chuckled and murmured, "Big brother wants to catch up quickly, huh?" She understands well.

<b>

"They might not realize how tough leveling up is. We can change to a third job now, but we haven't touched it yet, so it's still unclear."

<b>

Shin, laughing self-deprecatingly, took a sip of the tea Aine brought and opened his mouth again.

<b>

"So, what are you going to do after marrying Fenon and Sera? This is technically a party house, so you'll prepare a new home, right?"

<b>

"Ah... speaking of which, I guess I have to build another house."

<b>

I had completely forgotten about that.

It's only natural, but it wouldn't be good to make this house, which Shin and the others contributed to, the new home. There is a house that Noah and the others built based on their memories a bit away from the city, so living there is an option, but if I hire a butler and maids, it might feel a bit cramped.

<b>

"I think Fenon and Sera would agree, but I like that house too, so why not consider an expansion or renovation? It might require more security since it's not in the city."

<b>

"Oh! That could work!"

<b>

At Noah's suggestion, I couldn't help but clap my hands.

I also really like that house—and that place.

Initially, it was built to efficiently explore A-rank and B-rank dungeons, but it's quiet there compared to the city, and the scenery is beautiful. It has a calm atmosphere where time seems to flow slowly.

<b>

"If we're going to rebuild it significantly, it might take some time. You mentioned wanting to visit other countries, right? How about we combine that with a honeymoon while the construction is happening? Even though it's a honeymoon, I'll be going with you and Shiri."

<b>

"That much is fine, right?" Noah laughed. Of course, if Fenon comes, her attendant Shiri would come along too, and it would be sad to leave Noah behind. I think it would be more enjoyable if she came along as well.

<b>

"Hehe, thanks."

<b>

"Hey, don't read people's minds without permission, brat. I haven't said anything."

<b>

"I'm not using mind reading, okay? We've spent so much time together that I can tell just by looking at your expression."

<b>

"Eh? Really?"

<b>

When she said that, I touched my cheeks, but I couldn't remember what expression I had just made. Was it something like 'good grief'? That's a bit embarrassing.

<b>

"Hey, don't forget about me and start flirting. Should I report this to Fenon and Sera?"

<b>

"Th-that wasn't flirting! It's just a casual conversation between a brother and sister, you know? Just a normal daily chat. Yeah."

<b>

Using the word "flirting" all of a sudden makes it awkward!

Look at Noah. She looks so awkward—why are you smirking too? Am I the only one feeling weird about this?

<b>

I closed my eyes and let out a deep sigh.

Reset, reset. Forget that exchange and change the subject.

Um, what should I talk about? Favorite foods or something... what am I, an idiot? What kind of last resort topic is that when I'm stuck!

<b>

As I was panicking internally, Noah threw me a lifeline, asking, "Do you have any candidate countries you want to visit?" Oh! Thank you, God! —Wait, come to think of it, this guy was originally a god.

<b>

"Well... I plan to visit all of them eventually, but for now, maybe the Palmour Kingdom."

<b>

"Ah, that's relatively close from Lindell. By the way, the representative party from there, Neska, was praising you a lot."

<b>

"Really? That's nice to hear. She was at the arena that time."

<b>

Speaking of which, were all the participants in the martial arts tournament there? I don't remember much since I was focused on the matches.

When I visit Palmour, it might be interesting to have a spar with that Neska person.
