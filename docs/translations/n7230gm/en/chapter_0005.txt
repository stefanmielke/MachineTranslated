# 4 The Guild Master's Struggles

<b>

<b>

The guild master was bald.

<b>

Excuse me. For his honor, let’s correct that to "shaved head."

<b>

As I took out the dagger with the royal crest, the receptionist girl looked like she was about to cry when the head of the Explorer Guild, Mr. Regulus, appeared.

<b>

Guided by him, I moved to a separate room with a three-person party led by a handsome man and a red-haired countess. Just as Mr. Regulus seemed about to leave, the receptionist girl in front of me hurriedly ran after him, seeking help. You could say she fled from right in front of me.

<b>

With all that, I am currently enjoying tea and cookies elegantly in a private room within the Explorer Guild.

<b>

"Is it still not time?"

<b>

Looking at the clock on the window, it was just past 8:30.

According to the receptionist who was in charge of me, it seemed that the discussion on the other side would end quickly, so I was put on hold. She had been bowing her head to me the whole time.

As an apology for making me wait, it seemed she had prepared delicious sweets and high-quality tea, but... I’m bored. I would have been much happier if they had left a manga or two instead of the tea and sweets. I know it’s asking for the impossible.

<b>

About ten minutes after checking the clock, Mr. Regulus entered the room, lightly apologizing for being late.

<b>

In the room, there was a scruffy, muscular bald man and me alone. Despite the low population density, it felt unusually hot.

He began speaking after saying, "This room is soundproof."

<b>

"I’ve received word from the royal castle. You came from another world, right? What a disaster."

<b>

As he sat on the sofa across from me, Mr. Regulus said that.

Oh, so he knew about me. Since I had said I would become an explorer, someone who knew the circumstances must have informed him beforehand.

<b>

"I understand you are a guest of the country, but because of that, your wishes cannot be granted. You understand the reason, right?"

<b>

So I was a guest. As a former NEET, that feels awkward.

<b>

"...Is it because it's dangerous?"

<b>

"Exactly. You understand well."

<b>

Mr. Regulus nodded in satisfaction at my answer. However, for me, just backing down because it’s dangerous isn’t an option. The princess's life is at stake.

<b>

"...What about the elixir?"

<b>

I asked just in case, so that the guild master wouldn’t have to know.

<b>

"Of course, I know about Her Highness the princess. There were a man and two women earlier, right? They are from a party called 'Thunderbolt's Trail,' the strongest in this country. I’ve entrusted them with the B-rank dungeon—though it’s probably impossible for them."

<b>

"What floors have they cleared?"

<b>

When I asked that, Mr. Regulus tilted his head in confusion.

<b>

"SR came from another world, right? Was there a similar dungeon?"

<b>

"Not exactly... I was interested in explorers, so I casually listened to some conversations in the town."

<b>

In reality, I hadn’t spoken a word to the townsfolk. I had only exchanged money with the innkeeper.

<b>

"...Hmm, well, that’s fine. They barely manage to clear the third floor. It’s the same as when I was active."

<b>

Except for the exception of the SS-rank dungeon where the Overlord Venom resides, all dungeons, regardless of rank, have five floors. The size varies by rank, but the number of floors doesn’t change. Thunderbolt's Trail is currently at the halfway point.

<b>

Even if they try their best, they probably won’t be able to conquer a B-rank dungeon. Even if they did, there would likely be casualties in the party.

<b>

"So, are you giving up on obtaining the elixir?"

<b>

"...Halfway. It would be impossible unless a miracle happens."

<b>

Mr. Regulus said with a face that looked like he had bitten into a bitter bug.

<b>

"It’s impossible to suddenly do something that hasn’t been done in over 300 years. The princess's life is important, but I am the head of the Explorer Guild. Their lives are just as important to me. I can’t push them too hard."

<b>

He said that and let out a deep sigh, then downed the tea on the table in one go. Hey, that was my tea!

<b>

Sigh... If only the atmosphere was more like, "Go dungeon diving even if you die!" it would have been much easier. Because he is kind, it makes things harder.

<b>

"Still, I want to help the princess."

<b>

With my head half bowed, I made that statement.

<b>

I don’t have a huge debt of gratitude to her.

I’m not being ordered by anyone to "do it."

My own life isn’t at stake either.

<b>

"SR has just come to this world, right? It’s not something you should worry about."

<b>

"That may be true. But—"

<b>

I want to tell Mr. Regulus.

That I might have knowledge that could help the princess.

<b>

However, I don’t think he would believe in something I’m not even sure about myself. I don’t think he would allow something that seems reckless, given how he cares for the lives of explorers.

<b>

I interrupted the words I was about to weave and asked, "How about this?"

<b>

"Please let me have a one-on-one with someone who has cleared a D-rank dungeon."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"First, let’s at least finish the F-rank dungeon."

<b>

After leaving the Explorer Guild, I stretched my back. Sitting on the sofa for a long time had made me tired instead.

<b>

After that, Mr. Regulus, who was holding his head, told me, "I can’t decide on my own," so I would have to go back to the Explorer Guild tomorrow morning. He would probably consult someone from the royal castle. I can only hope for a good answer.

<b>

"The entrance to the F-rank dungeon should be adjacent to the town. The current time is... just past 9:30, cutting it close."

<b>

It seems that in this world, you can only enter dungeons from 9 AM to 10 PM. This is another element not found in games.

It’s probably a rule to protect explorers, but for me, who wants to level up quickly, it’s nothing but a hindrance.

<b>

I bought a reasonably priced short sword at the weapon shop and hurried toward the dungeon.

<b>

<b>

Dungeons in this world don’t take the form of towers, nor do they spread underground. There’s only a teleportation magic circle in the center of a building that resembles a complete Parthenon.

<b>

With no worries about monsters overflowing, dungeons provide precious resources to explorers. Therefore, it’s only natural that towns are built near dungeons.

<b>

"Feeling both nostalgic and fresh... it’s contradictory."

<b>

At a spot where I could see the entire F-rank dungeon, I muttered absentmindedly.

Oh no, I need to hurry; time is running out.

<b>

The entrance to the dungeon was surrounded by a stone wall about 2 meters high, and near the only place to enter, there was a private room set up.

It felt like a prefab without a door.

<b>

"Are they doing the reception there?"

<b>

Hmm. When I see something I’ve never seen in a game, I can’t help but feel confused.

Peeking through the window into the private room, I saw a woman wearing the uniform of a receptionist from the Explorer Guild, sitting in a chair and yawning widely.

<b>

For the sake of this woman’s honor, I approached the private room while intentionally making loud footsteps.

<b>

"Um, I’d like to enter the dungeon. Is it still okay?"

<b>

As soon as I entered the room, I asked that. The reception was a simple room with only an L-shaped counter.

<b>

"Yes. You can enter."

<b>

"Then I’ll go in. Is there anything I need for the reception? It’s my first time, so I don’t know much."

<b>

"Yes. Please write your name and occupation here. We will fill in the room and entry time."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

By the way, the room is like a "server" in a game. This means that even if you dive into the same dungeon, you will be teleported to different rooms, so you won’t encounter other explorers inside the dungeon. I was relieved that this was the same as in the game. Friendly fire in real life would be no joke.

<b>

After receiving explanations about the return method and precautions in the dungeon, I exited the room with the woman’s words of "Take care" ringing in my ears.

<b>

"My first dungeon in the flesh."

<b>

I must save the princess.

<b>

I know that’s the priority, but right now, I was just excited about diving into the dungeon.

That game I got hooked on is now my reality! How could I not be thrilled!

<b>

With high spirits, I stepped onto the teleportation magic circle, and a stone pillar rose to the height of my waist. There was a depression just right for a license card to fit.

<b>

When I placed the license card in the depression, a room selection screen appeared—after selecting an available room, the magic circle began to shine. The rising light gently enveloped me.

<b>

Thus, on the first day of my otherworldly life, I stepped into the dungeon.
