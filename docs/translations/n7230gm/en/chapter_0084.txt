# 81 Anomaly

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the city of Reinas, at the Explorer's Guild, I had been informed three days ago by Mr. Riles, the guild leader, about the date when the Thunderbolt Trail would challenge the A-rank dungeon.

<b>

That date is today.

To the public, it is not a special day, just an ordinary one. However, this day will be remembered in history as the day when the A-rank dungeon was first conquered. Even the conquest of a B-rank dungeon caused quite a stir, so this time it should be even more remarkable.

<b>

From my perspective, considering my desire to level up, I feel like it's about time— and thinking about how the appearance of the S-rank dungeon will prompt me to confess my feelings to the two of them, I can't help but think, "I need to prepare myself..."

I don't intend to run away now, but I am still nervous.

<b>

"According to Mr. Riles, they seem to have been diving since morning, so it should be soon."

<b>

With the status and combat skills of the Thunderbolt Trail, conquering an A-rank dungeon is definitely possible. From my viewpoint, they seem overly cautious. However, in this world where death is the end, their approach to exploration is likely the "correct" one. Being overly cautious is just right.

<b>

I leave the city of Reinas, steeling myself as I head home. The color of the sky was shifting from blue to orange.

<b>

The purpose of my visit to the city today—of course, is to buy a bouquet of flowers to give to Sera and Fenon.

The bouquet, filled with a variety of colorful flowers, is in my inventory. While trying to calm my racing heart, I make my way to the house where everyone is waiting. The three party members should be relaxing at home.

<b>

In the distance, I can see the B-rank dungeon, my house, and the A-rank dungeon lined up at equal intervals.

<b>

Since I practiced confessing while diving solo in dungeons, I should be fine. If anyone had seen that scene, they would undoubtedly be completely put off.

If there was someone shouting, "I love you!" while slashing at monsters, they'd definitely pretend they didn't see anything and leave immediately. What a weirdo.

<b>

As I recall that moment with a wry smile,

<b>

"…Tinnitus?"

<b>

I heard a small sound, like something you might hear during a hearing test.

At first, it was a very faint sound.

<b>

The high-pitched sound, which was so small that I couldn't tell if it was actually there or just my imagination, gradually grew louder.

<b>

"—tsuu"

<b>

It hurts, my head is spinning. Damn, it's so loud!

That unpleasant sound eventually became a deafening noise that made me worry my eardrums would burst.

<b>

Damn it! What the hell is this!?

<b>

I covered my ears and crouched down, holding my head. I couldn't hear any surrounding sounds, but the problematic noise seemed to resonate in my head and showed no signs of subsiding. The sound was so loud that my vision was blurring.

Even now, I feel like I'm at my limit, yet the unpleasant sound in my head keeps getting louder.

<b>

Then, my distorted vision blurred even more.

It was like a game bug screen—or like when you rewind an old videotape, the scenery stretched sideways.

<b>

Just as I began to feel nauseous, that sound suddenly stopped, and the bizarre sight I had been seeing returned to normal. Immediately after, I heard a voice like that of a young child who hadn't even hit puberty yet.

<b>

"Defeat Venom. That will return everything to normal."

<b>

I couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl, but it was a pure, untainted soprano voice. Although it was coming from right next to me, all I could see around me was a vast grassland, with not a single person in sight.

<b>

Venom? Return? What’s going on all of a sudden? And who are you?

<b>

"Who are you?"

<b>

I managed to squeeze out a voice to ask, but there was no response. You call out to me, but ignore my words? Damn it!

In the first place, I had never spoken to anyone about Venom since I came to this world. Just knowing that name confirms that the voice's owner is not normal.

<b>

"Tch."

<b>

I clicked my tongue at the incomprehensible situation and, still holding my spinning head, I sat cross-legged to calm myself. I directed my gaze to my legs, trying to sort out the current phenomenon and the words spoken by the child in my mind.

<b>

"—Huh?"

<b>

Then I remembered that I had seen the "bizarre sight" when I tried to look for the voice's owner. I hurriedly raised my face and directed my gaze toward the direction of my house.

<b>

"…No way."

<b>

In my line of sight were the B-rank dungeon, the A-rank dungeon, and my house. That’s fine.

<b>

"An S-rank dungeon—?"

<b>

Currently, I see a total of "eight" dungeons.

Surrounding my house, six new dungeons have appeared. They are positioned even closer than the B-rank and A-rank dungeons. Perhaps a five-minute walk from my house.

<b>

"This is so confusing… really, everything is."

<b>

The fact that they have appeared means that it must be an S-rank dungeon. The Thunderbolt Trail must have successfully conquered the A-rank dungeon. However, the appearance and number of dungeons differ from what I know of the game Tempest.

<b>

In the first place, S-rank dungeons are supposed to appear only once in each of the six countries in this world.

Yet for some reason, they are clustered around my house. That’s impossible.

<b>

"…Calm down, me. The number of S-rank dungeons appearing doesn't have to be the same as in the game. Besides, I haven't even confirmed that those dungeons are S-rank dungeons, and the fact that they gathered around my house… could just be a coincidence."

<b>

It feels too coincidental to be mere chance, but I decided to ignore that for now. I feel like dwelling on it won’t lead to a resolution of this inexplicable phenomenon.

<b>

"The child said to defeat Venom, right?"

<b>

The voice of the young child I heard when the tinnitus stopped. I think that child also used the phrase "return to normal."

<b>

"I have no idea what is supposed to return to normal… and besides, I have no intention of challenging Venom at this point."

<b>

There are too many things I don't understand.

About the dungeons, the voice's owner, and the meaning of the words.

<b>

It has become a situation where confessing my feelings is the least of my concerns.

I need to calm down and properly understand this mysterious phenomenon; otherwise, it feels unsettling.

<b>

"For now, I should check out the new dungeons…"

<b>

I slowly stood up and began to walk toward my house—no, toward the newly appeared dungeons.

If that is an S-rank dungeon, I shouldn't be able to enter it with my license card, which has no record of conquering an A-rank dungeon. First, I need to confirm that.

<b>

I walked through the grassland, dragging my heavy feet while rubbing my head with one hand.
