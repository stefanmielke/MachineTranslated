# A-104 Cabaret Club?

<b>

<b>

<b>

The Vinzett siblings, who had been acting together with Crescent and the others, returned home looking completely exhausted. I wanted to ask for their impressions, but they seemed to lack the energy for that. They probably postponed their report to the kings until tomorrow.

<b>

For Arnold and Jill, this was their first S-rank dungeon. It seemed they had already cleared an A-rank dungeon, but it was still tough for them in the S-rank dungeon.

That said, it doesn't seem like that's the only reason.

<b>

Just a moment ago, Jade mentioned something about being "asked for guidance," so they might have undergone some insane training. While their level experience might be decent, it's likely that the practical experience they gained was substantial.

<b>

"What on earth did you guys do...?"

<b>

"Well, it was practical training! They seemed a bit unaccustomed to it, so they struggled a bit, and it looked pretty tough when it was two against one, but I think once their stats catch up, they'll be able to clear S-rank too."

<b>

"We were watching closely, so we ensured their safety to prevent any deaths."

<b>

Following Crescent's words, Jade also spoke with a somewhat proud expression. I had a feeling it was some hard-core training. After all, these guys seemed to be treating it like a game.

They probably understand that dying means game over... well, they probably do, but the level of expectation might be that of the Tempest Rankers.

After all, the Vinzett siblings are powerful enough to be representatives of their country as explorers.

<b>

"...Are you both okay, Jade and Crescent?"

<b>

As Jade and Crescent sat on the opposite sofa, I asked them that.

After all, they had only recently come to this world. I wanted to check if they were adapting well to this world, having lived in Japan before.

<b>

"Well, it's Tempest, after all."

<b>

"I feel the same way. I was originally in a hospital, so I had few real friends."

<b>

I see. Indeed, this game's world incorporates a lot of Earth's culture.

Originally, it seems this world was transformed to defeat the Demon King Venom, and a similar game was created on Earth to find strong individuals capable of defeating Venom alone.

<b>

"If someone had said, 'Your main food is cockroaches,' I would have been crying and wanting to go home immediately."

<b>

"Even I would cry at that."

<b>

"Don't make me imagine weird things, Mika... ugh."

<b>

It seems one person was injured by Crescent's tactless remark. Not so much injured, but it felt like my insides were being twisted. Poor thing. I felt a bit nauseous too.

As Jade and I directed resentful glances at Crescent, she raised both hands and mockingly said, "You two really have no resistance, huh?" before putting her hands behind her head.

Then, she said with a bored expression.

<b>

"But you know, honestly, without ranking battles or SSS-rank dungeons, it feels like there's no point in training, or rather—there's nowhere to exert my strength, and it’s super frustrating. Clearing S-rank dungeons is obviously a piece of cake."

<b>

"Ah..."

<b>

At Crescent's words, Jade and I simultaneously let out a sound.

Well, still,

<b>

"In my case, it was a bit better. After all, I came to this world with no job selected and pure initial stats. It felt like I had some restrictions, so I faced some struggles."

<b>

When I said that, Crescent replied, "Like during the princess rescue mission," and glanced at Phanon, who was chatting with Sera a little further away. Then, Sili, who was sitting next to Phanon, whispered something, and she turned to look at us.

And then she waved cheerfully. So, I waved back.

<b>

"Wow, you're all lovey-dovey. Well, Phanon is incredibly beautiful, so if someone like her smiles at you, I guess you'd end up like that."

<b>

"She feels like a doll, doesn't she, Phanon? The fact that SR is marrying someone like her is just amazing. Plus, Sera is also beautiful and from a count's family, so they're really high-status people. They’re so friendly that you might forget that."

<b>

While saying that, the two of them were bowing their heads to the three people looking our way. By the way, Noah was lying next to me, snoring softly.

<b>

"It's fine for you two, but please spare me. I'm really not that great of a person in your eyes."

<b>

For the people of this world, the skills I had might have been useful, and I suppose I could be praised for saving the world to some extent.

However, what I was doing was just a game.

Sure, I was engrossed in it like an idiot and was serious about it, but it stemmed from escapism, and I was aware that the circumstances weren't something to be praised. Because of that, especially from these girls from my hometown, it was hard to genuinely enjoy their praise.

<b>

"Well, it's a game, after all. But we were really hooked on Tempest, so SR is definitely someone we admire. You might be the only one I thought I couldn't see a winning path against."

<b>

It's an honor to hear that from a pro gamer. She must have played various games, and to be called "the only one" makes me happy.

<b>

"SR's use of Byakuren—or rather, the way SR fights with the Demon King matches so perfectly with Byakuren that it was just overwhelming. Challenging five rankers alone is definitely insane. —Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Of course, I'm complimenting you! I'm praising you to the highest degree!"

<b>

"Ahaha, thank you very much."

<b>

I said to calm down the flustered Jade. It feels like I'm in a cabaret club because of how these two are praising me. Though I've never been, so it's just my imagination.

<b>

Now, what should I do tomorrow?
