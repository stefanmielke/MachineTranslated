# 46 Absolutely Dangerous

<b>

This is a story from Shin's perspective about the Thunderbolt's Trail.

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Two weeks have passed since SR and the others left the royal capital.

<b>

The information about the derived advanced classes that he brought has spread among many explorers, and the guild has finally managed to ease the congestion enough to operate normally.

<b>

Still, compared to before, there are many more explorers visiting the guild, and there is always a long line at the counter. The receptionists and the guild master are probably still having a hectic time.

<b>

By this time, among the explorers, those with real skill have changed to derived advanced classes and have started leveling up.

<b>

That said, there’s no need to panic upon hearing that fact.

<b>

After all, we, the Thunderbolt's Trail, are receiving direct advice from the very person who provided the information, so it’s unlikely that other explorers will surpass us. We were also quicker to start leveling up our lower classes.

<b>

If there is any concern about being surpassed, it would be with Sera, the princess, and the maid, Shiri.

I thought it was impossible for them to return normally after leaving the royal capital with him.

<b>

<b>

The time was 10 PM.

While returning from a B-rank dungeon, I kept repeating "dangerous" to my companions walking beside me.

<b>

"We're going to be diving into dungeons with SR for almost a month, right? It’s definitely going to be dangerous."

<b>

His guidance is quite intense. The demands he makes are strict, but the results that follow are even more impressive.

<b>

"As he said, we managed to clear the B-rank dungeon just the three of us."

<b>

"Exactly. It was unthinkable before."

<b>

Yes―― we finally succeeded in clearing the B-rank dungeon without SR or Sera.

<b>

While it was partly because of the status bonuses he taught us that strengthened us, observing the boss's movements up close for an extended period was also beneficial. It’s all thanks to SR.

<b>

"I don't know about the princess or the maid, but Sera will definitely evolve, right? She was already unusually fast at leveling up to C-rank, and she adapted to our teamwork in no time. If a monster like SR is guiding her, it’s definitely going to be dangerous."

<b>

I ended up saying "dangerous" again. However, I didn’t know how else to express it.

Hearing my words, Suzu and Laika responded with similar vocabulary, saying "It’s dangerous" and "Seems dangerous."

As expected from spending many years together, their teamwork was on point. Well, maybe it was a bit different.

<b>

After that, we speculated about what kind of evolution the two and the princess would undergo when they returned, and once the conversation reached a pause, Laika spoke up.

<b>

"By the way, Sera mentioned she was fighting with Rei. Have you heard anything, Shin?"

<b>

It seemed Suzu and Laika had heard directly from Sera. It must have been easier to talk since they were both women. Although, they said they didn’t share the details.

<b>

"Ah... I heard from Rei too—wait, Laika, why does your sister call him by his first name while you call her 'Sera-san'?"

<b>

Now that I think about it, Suzu also referred to Sera as "Sera-san."

<b>

"Well, Rei was close with Shin, so he had many opportunities to talk to us, and he seems a bit silly, right? It just doesn’t suit him to use honorifics."

<b>

When Laika said that, Suzu nodded in agreement.

<b>

Rei is technically the strongest swordsman in the kingdom's knight order... but since that’s a fact, I couldn’t argue against it.

<b>

From my perspective, I feel like Sera is a bit absent-minded too—however, since they have less interaction with Sera compared to me, they might not have noticed that part of her resembles their brother.

<b>

I gave Laika a casual nod to keep the conversation flowing and decided to explain the incident that occurred between Sera and Rei.

<b>

Since I wasn’t there to witness it, I prefaced my story by saying I didn’t know if it was true or not.

<b>

"Rei said he wanted to confirm his strength after clearing the B-rank dungeon. He was happy that Sera had grown stronger without her knowing, and it seems he challenged her to a mock battle thinking he would lose, but he ended up winning without much effort."

<b>

"Ah..."

<b>

Both of them let out a sound of understanding.

Sera has indeed become stronger, but from my perspective, Rei still has more experience and skill.

<b>

"But does that lead to a fight? I can understand if he feels frustrated, but..."

<b>

"Well, after the match, Rei said, 'I feel like I can take on the B-rank dungeon now!' and apparently, he went in alone. He said Sera tried to stop him, but he brushed her off and charged in."

<b>

"Ah..."

<b>

"And as expected, he came out of the dungeon all battered, and Sera was waiting outside, half in tears. It seems Rei told her, 'It’s not that Sera has become strong, nor have I become strong.'"

<b>

"Ah..."

<b>

When I heard this from Rei, I reacted similarly to them. Then I hit my head with my fist.

We, who have earned titles, are now in a higher position than Rei, so there’s no problem. Well, I had been doing the same thing before.

<b>

"Sera also hadn’t received a title among us. She must have had her own thoughts about her strength. If her brother said something like that, it would definitely upset her."

<b>

The reason for her anger is probably that it hit too close to home for Sera.

Suzu, who had a strained expression, opened her mouth and said, "But..."

<b>

"SR is training Sera and the others, right? Moreover, there’s no doubt that Rei will win the individual competition in the martial arts tournament. In the end, it will be him and Sera fighting."

<b>

"Ah, that seems likely."

<b>

Regarding the individual competition, it seems SR declined to participate, or rather, Sera expressed her desire to compete. She probably wanted a chance for a revenge match against her brother.

Just like SR, she has a competitive personality.

<b>

Such a match between siblings—of course, we are more worried about the brother.

<b>

"Is Rei going to be okay?"

<b>

"Yes, yes. With Sera’s abnormal growth speed, she is being trained by the extraordinarily skilled SR. It’s dangerous."

<b>

"Well, if it comes to that, we can just use an elixir. As long as we don’t die, we can manage."

<b>

"That’s true. Better than losing an arm, at least."

<b>

"Yes, yes. I’m sure Duke Margus also received an elixir from SR and revived."

<b>

I can’t really criticize others, but these guys are quite something.

I smiled wryly at their words and said.

<b>

"Even if SR is a monster, we have our pride too. Tomorrow, we’ll be leveling up in the dungeon from morning!"

<b>

"Of course. We can’t afford to lose."

<b>

"Yes, yes. We’ll surprise SR and the others at the martial arts tournament!"

<b>

With our spirits high—we raised our fists towards the starry sky.

<b>

To live up to the title of "Pioneer" given by His Majesty, we will illuminate the path that other explorers should take.

We will show them that there is still much ahead in this world.

<b>

What SR mentioned about the overall level-up of the world—and the devaluation of elixirs.

<b>

When I first heard it, I thought, "That’s ridiculous," but both have started to feel plausible. In fact, if we wanted to, we could secure one elixir every day.

I wonder if it can still be called a legendary potion.

<b>

SR probably still holds many secrets about this world that we are unaware of.

<b>

What kind of bombshell statement is he planning to make next?

<b>

<b>

I was genuinely looking forward to it—

<b>

<b>

Until after the martial arts tournament when SR revealed a new secret.

<b>

Yes—until I asked about the place SR was aiming for.
