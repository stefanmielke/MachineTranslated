# A-114 Appearance

<b>

Noah, who had been slapped by Mom, seemed to think that the matter was settled and quickly returned. It felt less like a greeting and more like he had come to absorb the hatred.

<b>

Noah didn't apologize, and it didn't seem like Mom and the others were expecting one either. I think that's fine. In fact, it would have felt worse if Noah had apologized in that situation.

<b>

"What a loli god. Just like Lady Idea."

<b>

Dad murmured this while looking at the door Noah had closed.

<b>

"I don't know if I'll get scolded, okay? Noah feels like a friend now, but Lady Idea really feels like a god."

<b>

"…I apologize, Lady Idea."

<b>

Immediately, Dad was bowing deeply. His movements were incredibly smooth. Is he perhaps used to this? No, I want to believe it's just my imagination.

The memorable image of Dad was a very cool memory, but… I thought this side of him was also part of who he is.

<b>

For the next three days, I spent most of my time with my parents.

<b>

There were times I spent with my friends during meals, but aside from that, I was mostly with Dad and Mom. When introducing them to His Majesty, I had to bring Phenon along, but other than that, it was almost always the three of us.

<b>

To be able to spend time like this again with my parents, who were supposed to be dead… I never even dreamed of it. I could already say I was at the peak of happiness, yet there were still events left to further boost my excitement.

<b>

Isn't this just too amazing?

<b>

"The dungeons can be accessed from near the royal capitals of various countries. The entrances are different, but the insides are the same."

<b>

In the living room—four from ASR, three from Thunder's Trail, Crescent and Jade, and finally me. A total of eleven people were listening to Lady Idea's voice.

<b>

The topic, of course, was about the new dungeon.

First, the entry requirement is to clear an S-rank dungeon.

<b>

Well, they said they would make it high difficulty, and since dungeons in this world require clearing the previous rank to enter, it's only natural.

<b>

The difference starts here.

<b>

You won't die. This is probably the biggest point.

It seems there won't even be any blood, and it truly sounds like a game-like space.

And you can't earn anything—there are no drops.

<b>

Fortunately, it seems you can still gain experience points, so the new dungeon will likely be focused on leveling up. However, considering the difficulty, you probably need to be around a third job to be efficient.

<b>

"Is there a death penalty?"

<b>

"You cannot re-enter for twenty-four hours."

<b>

"Oh, if it's just that, then it's fine. Thank you."

<b>

Crescent asked the question I was also curious about. In that case, I don't want to be too reckless in my approach.

<b>

Her speech was as usual, but she was bowing elegantly to Lady Idea. It must have been tough for her to use formal language in front of so many comrades. I think Lady Idea probably sees through that.

<b>

"Check the details with your own eyes. It would be boring if I told you everything."

<b>

Lady Idea chuckled softly and gave us a brief farewell before disappearing.

The remaining members exchanged glances.

<b>

"It will probably be difficult for us. We need to be able to clear an S-rank dungeon with just the three of us first."

<b>

"Yes, yes. Well, I think it's better to have a challenge than to be told we can't go beyond S-rank."

<b>

"That's right."

<b>

First, the three from Thunder's Trail each made a comment. After that, discussions about "how to level up faster" and "who will take on which roles" took place. They were full of enthusiasm.

<b>

As for the ASR members, including me.

<b>

"I feel like with my stats, I might lose, and I don't like that~"

<b>

"That's because you're slacking off. Well, just work hard on leveling up with Sera and the others."

<b>

"I feel like we're still not ready for that place… but since we can enter, I want to check it out out of curiosity."

<b>

"It's reassuring that it's okay to die. If I'm with Esuar-san, maybe it won't be a problem."

<b>

"That's true… I wonder what it's like?"

<b>

All ASR members have cleared S-rank dungeons, so conversations like this come up. At this stage, the only one who seems likely to actually challenge it is Noah.

<b>

And of course, Crescent and Jade.

<b>

Worrying about it is probably pointless for them. They've already finished leveling, and going to the dungeon feels more like a leisure activity. I still have some classes that I haven't maxed out yet, so I can still level up.

<b>

"When can we start going to the dungeons? Did they talk about that?"

<b>

"I don't think they did."

<b>

"Hmm… they might create it soon? Since it's Lady Idea, she probably prepared for it."

<b>

While the Earth group was having that conversation, Regulus, who had been outside the circle, approached me.

He had a troubled expression on his face and was holding a communication magic tool.

<b>

Which means…?

<b>

"I just received a communication—it's probably good news for Esuar… It seems a strange building has appeared along the road west of the royal capital. Thanks to that, I might be buried in work."
