# 41 Show Me Your Overwhelming Power

<b>

<b>

<b>

Thanks to the elixir, Lord Drag regained his lost right hand and, as expected by Mr. Phenon, provided us with meals and lodging.

<b>

Ms. Siri and Sera seemed to feel a bit overwhelmed, considering that the other party was the head of a ducal family, but I wanted to say, "Take what you can get." Lord Drag also seemed apologetic not just to me but to Sera and the others as well.

<b>

At the dining table, there were moments when we were thanked by the duchess and her daughters, but aside from that, there was nothing noteworthy, so I’ll skip over it.

<b>

We fell asleep in a luxurious private room that made Japanese suites look cheap, and the next morning, we headed to the Explorer's Guild in Renas with the sealed letter we received from Lord Drag.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"I have two letters to deliver to the Guild Master. Is Mr. Lires here?"

<b>

It was just past 8 AM.

<b>

Compared to the guild in the royal capital, there were indeed fewer people, but perhaps due to many inquiries about secondary jobs, the inside of the building felt like a steam room filled with the heat of people. It reminded me of the morning commute rush.

<b>

I felt hesitant to bring the women inside, so I had them wait outside the guild.

Of course, Mr. Phenon and Sera were disguised with magical tools to avoid being recognized.

<b>

Since it wasn't about new jobs or regulations, the receptionist looked puzzled. After wiping the sweat from her forehead with a handkerchief, she spoke.

<b>

"I'm sorry, but what is the purpose of your visit? The Master is quite busy, so I would like to hear the details here first."

<b>

I understood what she meant.

Every time an explorer demands, "Call the Guild Master!" the head of the organization wouldn't just appear.

<b>

"It's not something I can easily talk about. Do you happen to recognize this name?"

<b>

As I said this, I took out my explorer license from my inventory.

It had my name and indicated which rank of dungeon I had cleared.

In my case, the Roman letters indicated a B. As of now, only five people, including myself, should have this designation in this world.

<b>

The receptionist, upon receiving the license card I took out, widened her eyes. She looked back and forth between my face and the license multiple times.

<b>

"Could it be that you are the one—Sir Esuar, who has received the title of 'Hero'?!"

<b>

Even though her voice was a whisper that couldn't be heard by those around us, I could sense her surprise from the tone.

I didn't want to be called by that title, so I didn't show my bracelet... what was the point?

I let out a small sigh and lowered my chin.

<b>

"Yes. I would like to request that you keep your voice down. The letters are from Mr. Regulus, the Guild Master of the royal capital, and Duke Margus. I would also like to speak directly with Mr. Lires, so if you have time, I would appreciate it if you could relay my request."

<b>

She nodded in response to my words.

<b>

"He should be taking a nap right now, so I'll wake him up immediately!"

<b>

"No, that's—"

<b>

If he's tired, it would be cruel to wake him up forcefully. I could wait for about 30 minutes.

Thinking that, I tried to stop the receptionist, but she saluted and immediately left for the back door.

<b>

By the way, "wake him up"—is he someone who is easygoing? Or is he the type who gets pushed around?

<b>

Left behind, I let out a dry laugh, "Ha ha ha..."

<b>

<b>

A few minutes later, I received a response from the receptionist, saying, "You can meet him right away." I stepped outside the guild once, then returned with the three who had been waiting outside.

We pushed through the crowd, receiving curious glances from the explorers, and were guided by the receptionist to a private room on the second floor.

<b>

And finally, we met.

<b>

As the four of us sat on the sofa, the receptionist brought in familiar tea and snacks.

Once she exited the room, the man sitting across from us began to speak.

<b>

"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. I am Lires, the head of the Renas branch of the Explorer's Guild. I've been busy lately, so I was resting in my room."

<b>

He appeared to be in his late thirties.

He had the same black hair as me and Ms. Siri, and his hair was tousled as if he had just woken up. He must have gotten that way while taking a nap.

<b>

He was slender and had a refreshing appearance. Unless someone pointed it out, you wouldn't realize he was related to Mr. Regulus. His eyes resembled his slightly.

<b>

"I am Sera Bernot."

<b>

Sitting to my left, Sera introduced herself and then removed the magical tool attached to her hair. Her dark brown hair quickly transformed back to its original deep crimson color.

<b>

Mr. Lires looked stunned.

Before he could react, I followed Sera's lead.

<b>

"I am Explorer Esuar."

<b>

Then, the princess and Ms. Siri also introduced themselves to Mr. Lires.

<b>

"I am Phenon von Lindell."

<b>

"I serve Mr. Phenon, I am Siri."

<b>

After removing her magical tool, Ms. Phenon returned to her original hair color, just like Sera.

<b>

Mr. Lires, who had been frozen in shock for a while, hurriedly bowed his head toward Ms. Phenon.

<b>

"I apologize for not recognizing you, Your Highness."

<b>

It's understandable that he didn't realize.

Not a single person in the town had noticed her.

<b>

If anything, the attention was more on me.

<b>

Surrounded by beautiful women, it was only natural that jealous glances would be directed at me. If the roles were reversed, I might have been able to kill with a glare.

<b>

"Right now, I am an explorer. There is no need for formalities."

<b>

"Your Highness is an explorer—?"

<b>

"Yes. Perhaps there is something written in the letter that might clarify—Sir Esuar, let’s read the sealed letter first."

<b>

"That makes sense."

<b>

I also didn't know what was written.

Lord Drag's letter was probably related to B-rank dungeons, but what about Mr. Regulus's letter?

<b>

Placing the two sealed letters on the table, Mr. Lires began reading the one from Lord Drag first.

I could see him following the text with his eyes.

<b>

"Are you requesting permission to enter a B-rank dungeon?"

<b>

"Yes. I heard it is currently sealed. I have received permission from Lord Drag, just in case."

<b>

"Also, the letter mentions that you want to confirm if there are no issues with your abilities—"

<b>

"Yes, he did mention that."

<b>

In response to my reply, Mr. Lires pondered for a moment, saying, "Hmm," and placed his hand on his chin.

<b>

"Are you going to dive with four people?"

<b>

"Yes."

<b>

"What are each of your roles?"

<b>

At that question, I froze, unable to answer immediately.

<b>

If I said I would defeat everything by myself, I would be looked at strangely, and I would have to get a non-disclosure agreement signed to keep it quiet—

<b>

"The monsters can all be handled by Sir Esuar alone. With Sera and Siri as guards, that should be sufficient. Just so you know, this matter is strictly confidential. If you accidentally let it slip to anyone else, the Lindell royal family will take action."

<b>

Hey... give me back the time I spent worrying.

Well, if they’re going to keep it quiet, that’s fine.

<b>

"You can handle the monsters in a B-rank dungeon by yourself? I can't believe such an absurd claim, Your Highness. If that were true, it contradicts the rumors going around."

<b>

The rumors are probably about how Sera and I cleared the B-rank dungeon while riding on the coattails of Thunder's Trail.

<b>

"I understand why you would find it hard to believe, but it is the truth. You should experience your own powerlessness firsthand."

<b>

Sera adds on, as if striking while the iron is hot.

It’s almost as if she’s saying, “You should suffer the same pain I did.”

<b>

Mr. Lires furrowed his brow but quickly replied, "I understand."

<b>

"Though I hold the position of Guild Master, I am also an active explorer. My highest achievement so far has been the third level of a B-rank dungeon. If I were to grant you entry, it wouldn't be enough just to defeat me. Show me that you can overwhelm me, Sir Esuar."

<b>

I had somewhat anticipated this, but it seems I would indeed have to fight.

<b>

I think this is the best way to prove my abilities, but if possible, I wanted to settle this through discussion. I want to get to the dungeon quickly.

Well, since the receptionist forced Mr. Lires to wake up, I have some time to spare.

<b>

"…That's fine. However, I request that it be without an audience."

<b>

When I responded this way, Mr. Lires sighed as if exasperated.

<b>

"You have quite the confidence, indeed. As expected of someone with a title."

<b>

With a wry smile, Mr. Lires reached for the other sealed letter. He tilted his head as he opened it.

<b>

"I just contacted my brother a few days ago via communication..."

<b>

As he said this, he unfolded the letter he had taken out.

<b>

Upon seeing the contents, he froze, as if petrified by Medusa's gaze. The letter slipped from his hand.

<b>

As if it had a will of its own, the letter fluttered through the air and slid in front of us, facing up.

<b>

On the creased A4-sized paper was a hurriedly written, not-so-neat script. In large, clear letters, it read:

<b>

<b>

"I don't think this is the case, but don't even think about testing Esuar's abilities. If it comes to a one-on-one duel, make sure to hold back enough!"
