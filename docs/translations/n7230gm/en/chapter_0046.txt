# 44 Consultation with Sera

<b>

<b>

<b>

The first battle.

<b>

I sealed Lyreis's attack while deflecting his wooden sword, achieving victory.

He is going to pick up the thrown wooden sword. Although it was a complete defeat, judging by his posture, he doesn't seem to have lost his fighting spirit.

<b>

As for the women, they still wear blank expressions. While I appreciate their surprise, I wish the receptionist would at least declare my victory.

<b>

"Shall we continue?"

<b>

Lyreis, having picked up his sword, returns to his original stance with a combative smile.

<b>

"Yes. That's my first win."

<b>

I replied with a smile.

His enthusiastic expression would have earned him a perfect score from me if I were the judge.

<b>

"I don't feel like I can win, but at least I want to make it tense. I'm a man too, and I don't like losing all the time."

<b>

"I can't afford to lose either."

<b>

If this were Earth, it would be a different story.

Outside of the game, I was used to losing in sports, studies, or work. Losing doesn’t hurt or itch me.

<b>

<b>

The second and third battles followed.

He tried various tactics, cutting upward from below and attempting to use his feet to outmaneuver me, but those movements were something top players in Tempest could easily handle while chatting.

We played without fear of death, and the number of times we had escaped the brink of death far exceeded his.

<b>

And I was no exception.

After all, I was at the top. I didn't have the data, but my death count in the game must also be among the highest.

<b>

The results remained the same from the fourth battle onwards.

No matter what strategy he employed, my mind and body knew how to counter it.

Just like how one instinctively covers their mouth with their hand when yawning, my body unconsciously sought to perform the best actions. Unless restrained, there was no way I could lose to him.

<b>

A change occurred in the tenth battle.

<b>

"Ah..."

<b>

When I saw what he did, I couldn't help but let out that sound.

Even if he couldn't execute an attack, that was a poor move among poor moves.

<b>

He stepped backwards at the start and raised his sword high above his head.

If he created distance, I wouldn't be able to seal his attacks like I did in the previous nine battles.

I didn't possess the leg strength to close a 10-meter gap in an instant anymore.

<b>

Lyreis glared at me while in that raised position.

He must be planning to use the skill—Flying Sword.

<b>

The Flying Sword is a skill acquired at level 40 for swordsmen.

As its name suggests, it's a skill that allows one to launch slashes, activated as long as the user consciously decides to "use" it. There's no need to shout something like "Take this! Flying Sword!"

<b>

The range is exactly 8 meters.

The slash that shoots from the sword glimmers silver, and its effective range depends on the swing of the sword. The launching speed also relies on the user's skill.

Visually, it resembles a guillotine dropping sideways, which is not particularly cool. Additionally, it had a clear weakness, making it unpopular among Tempest players.

<b>

"Well, this will be good practice for Lyreis."

<b>

Shrugging, I muttered that and started walking towards him.

As the distance closed, I crossed the 8-meter range.

And just past 7 meters, Lyreis shouted “Ha!” and swung his sword horizontally at me.

At the same time, I charged at him and jumped diagonally upwards.

<b>

I stepped on the slash aimed at my thigh with my right foot.

Since this slash had physical form, it could be stepped on without issue. It was essentially a flying guillotine.

<b>

"Gotcha."

<b>

Using the slash as a foothold, I performed a somersault forward.

During this time, the possibility of him attacking me was nonexistent. Because using the Flying Sword skill causes the user to become immobilized. That was its greatest weakness.

<b>

The immobility lasts for 0.8 seconds.

In a player battle—especially close combat, that defenseless period is deadly.

<b>

"This is the end."

<b>

As soon as I landed, I pointed my sword at Lyreis right in front of him.

Just then, Lyreis was released from the skill's immobilization and smiled wryly, saying, "That's insane."

Then he raised both hands in a gesture of surrender.

<b>

<b>

In one of the private rooms in the duke's residence. It was past 10 PM.

Having finished dinner and a bath, I lay on the bed, staring up at the ceiling.

<b>

Having completely shut down Lyreis as planned, I earned the entry permission to the B rank dungeon and returned to the duke’s estate with Sera and the others.

To be honest, I wanted to dive into the dungeon right away, but if I went in now, I would return home close to midnight. I thought that would trouble the duke's family, so I reluctantly gave up on that.

<b>

Phenon said, "The feelings of Sir SR are the top priority!" and encouraged me to go to the dungeon, but I didn't have that kind of audacity. I decided today would be a day to rest my body.

<b>

"Let’s dive in first thing tomorrow morning."

<b>

As I rolled over in bed, I mumbled that to myself.

<b>

If it's the B rank dungeon in Renus, it would probably take me around six hours to complete one round. Even with breaks, if I start at 9 AM, I should be back home before 10 PM.

<b>

I should inform Drag that I'll be home around that time tomorrow morning. It might seem rude to ask for a place to stay while being this brazen, but I would appreciate it if he could have a meal ready for me.

He wouldn't worry, as he would be extremely grateful for the elixirs we provided, so he would agree right away.

<b>

As I was lost in such thoughts, I heard footsteps walking down the hallway.

The footsteps paused just in front of the door, and then a knock echoed in the room.

<b>

"Sera, right? You can come in."

<b>

Saying that, I sat up and placed myself on the edge of the bed.

I had grown accustomed to her knocking. It would be embarrassing if I were wrong.

<b>

"I'm sorry to disturb you at night. Were you already asleep?"

<b>

The one who opened the door and walked in was, as I expected, Sera.

What she wore was a casual outfit like the one she had on at my house in the royal capital—shorts and a shirt. I wish she would be more mindful of the fact that I’m a young man. Although my emotional age is quite high.

<b>

Also, since she’s in the duke's mansion, wouldn’t it be better for her to wear something a bit more respectful, like a dress or a nice outfit?

I wonder if she just doesn't care, or if this is normal in this game world...

<b>

"I want to discuss the dungeon exploration starting tomorrow."

<b>

"Sure. For now, just have a seat."

<b>

"Alright."

<b>

Nodding in response, she took a seat in a chair in front of the dresser that I wasn’t planning to use.

I don’t wear makeup, and I can tell if my hair is messy just by touching it without a mirror.

<b>

"I want to participate in the combat during the dungeon exploration before the martial arts tournament starting tomorrow. And if there are mistakes, I would like you to point them out, SR. There is no one in this world with your level of skill. Is that alright?"

<b>

...While leveling up is the best way to get stronger, it must be boring to just watch all the time.

Later on, when her status reaches its limit, the "skill" she is currently asking for will become necessary, so I didn’t have a reason to refuse.

<b>

After organizing her skill level and abilities in my mind, I replied, "That's fine."

<b>

"If I complete it alone, I can return by 10 PM even if I go twice. If Sera takes charge of the first layer, then we would be back by 11 PM—if we go to the second layer, it would probably pass midnight. If we reach the third layer, doing two rounds in one day will be difficult, so I’d prefer you to skip that."

<b>

What I’m hoping to get from this dungeon is something with a low drop rate. Even if I went through the dungeon twice every day, it would be a miracle to get one drop in a month.

<b>

"Then please let me fight just in the first layer. When I show progress, let me fight in the second layer as well. I’ll ask Phenon and Shiri on my end."

<b>

"Okay. I’ll leave that to you."

<b>

Princess, if I asked, she seems likely to agree to anything. So Sera is the right person for this.

<b>

"Are you feeling anxious about something?"

<b>

I gently inquired about the recent changes in her.

<b>

"………It's not that... Well, never mind."

<b>

Looking slightly downcast, Sera spoke softly.

<b>

"If you don’t want to say, that’s fine. But please don’t overdo it. You haven’t forgotten the promise, right?"

<b>

"Of course not. I trust you, I won’t betray you, and I won’t engage in dangerous actions—right?"

<b>

"That’s perfect. I’ll be giving you lots of advice, so prepare yourself."

<b>

To dispel the dark atmosphere, I attempted to joke, and she couldn’t help but smile in response.

<b>

"SR's criticism... sounds scary."

<b>

"It’s not scary; I’ll just be speaking the truth."

<b>

"That’s what makes it scary."

<b>

Though she kept saying it was scary, Sera's lips were smiling.

<b>

Then a small sigh slipped from her. Perhaps she didn’t want me to notice, she started stretching and massaging her shoulders, making unnatural movements.

<b>

The fact that she thought that could deceive me was so typical of Sera.

<b>

The issue she’s dealing with seems to be related to "family" and "ability."

It’s likely something happened with her brother Ray, who is probably part of the kingdom's knight order. Even if I figured that out, there’s nothing I can do about it.

<b>

As I watched the flustered Sera, I let out a small sigh just like her.
