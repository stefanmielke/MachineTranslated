# 33 Legendary Insurance

<b>

<b>

<b>

The time was just past 10 AM.

As I was tidying up the dishes used for breakfast with Sera and taking a moment to enjoy my coffee, Mr. Phenon and Ms. Shiri arrived.

<b>

"Lord SR! You're still here today!"

<b>

The spirited princess rushed over to me as soon as she spotted me, her feet pattering as she ran.

Instead of a dress befitting a princess, she wore lightweight armor that protected only the essential parts, similar to what Sera wore, making a light metallic sound as she moved.

<b>

"Good morning, Mr. Phenon. The meeting ended yesterday, so I'm just relaxing today."

<b>

In the past, I would stand up and bow my head every time Mr. Phenon and Ms. Shiri came, but now, when they knock on the door, I just shout from the sofa, "The door's unlocked!"

Since Mr. Phenon suggested it, I’m taking his advice.

<b>

Upon hearing my words, Mr. Phenon blossomed into a bright smile.

<b>

"Oh my! So we can spend today together!?"

<b>

After saying that, she leaned in closer to me, her big eyes sparkling even more. She somewhat resembled a small animal like a Chihuahua.

<b>

"Hey, hey, don't trouble SR too much. He seems to have a promise with Thunder's Trail today—besides, Phenon, you should get a bit more accustomed to dungeons. If you don't build up your stamina, you'll just be a burden to him."

<b>

As Sera gently admonished her, Mr. Phenon let out a small sigh and, pouting her lips, said in a quiet voice, "That's true." She seems to be quite understanding.

<b>

"If you can level up the remaining lower classes to 30, shall we explore together? And Ms. Shiri, you should join us too. It must be boring waiting outside, right?"

<b>

When I said that, Ms. Shiri tilted her head with a puzzled expression and asked, "Me too?"

<b>

"Yes. I heard you can use a bow, so let's level up together. The more power you gain, the better you can protect Mr. Phenon."

<b>

The last comment I added felt a bit underhanded, even to me.

<b>

However, considering the future, I want to secure someone who can attack from a distance. Sera is focused on close combat, and I plan for Mr. Phenon to assist with healing, similar to Suzu.

Above all, she's a familiar face, so it should be easier for Mr. Phenon.

<b>

Ms. Shiri was a bit hesitant, saying, "If everyone is okay with it..." but when Mr. Phenon and Sera showed positive reactions, she happily exclaimed, "I'll do my best!"

It seems waiting outside was indeed boring for her. Or perhaps, contrary to her appearance, she enjoys dungeon exploration.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After seeing the three off at the entrance, I sprawled out on the sofa and relaxed when the long-awaited Thunder's Trail arrived.

It had been since we celebrated after conquering the B-rank dungeon that I last met them.

<b>

After exchanging simple greetings at the door, I led them to the living room.

<b>

"You live in such a nice place..."

<b>

"It's spacious. It feels like a noble's house."

<b>

"Yes, yes. It seems like cleaning would take up the whole day."

<b>

As soon as the three entered the house, they let out unconscious sighs while looking around. It might be their first time seeing such an unnecessarily large house.

The royal castle is overwhelmingly more luxurious and spacious, but it probably feels rare because it has a sense of liveliness. I mean, if they have the money, Shin and the others should just buy one too.

<b>

By the way, when I was first shown this house, I was grimacing the whole time. My first impression was that I didn't need it.

<b>

"It seems the maids at the royal castle are doing the cleaning while I'm out."

<b>

This house has no privacy whatsoever.

<b>

Since I keep valuable items like the dagger with the crest and the bracelet indicating the cursed title of "Hero" in my inventory, there are no particular issues.

<b>

I would like to pay the maids for their cleaning, but it seems they were cleaning even when no one was living here, so that won't be necessary.

<b>

I let Shin and the others explore the house as they liked for a while.

It seems they enjoy exploring not just dungeons but houses as well. Their exploration skills are worthy of the number one in the Lindell Kingdom.

<b>

Jokes aside.

<b>

"How's the leveling going?"

<b>

I had them sit on the living room sofa and took a seat across from them at the table.

<b>

"Yeah. I've leveled the classes SR told me to up to 30."

<b>

"Oh, that was surprisingly quick."

<b>

"This is just a piece of cake."

<b>

With a smirk, Shin grinned.

At that moment, Ms. Laika chimed in with a retort.

<b>

"Oh, but you were saying, 'There's no way I can do this!'"

<b>

"Shut up—don't say that kind of stuff!"

<b>

"I believe you also said, 'I'll remember this, SR.'"

<b>

Suzu mimicked Shin's voice skillfully. It was quite similar.

<b>

"That's why I said—no, no, this is different, SR! I mean, I will never forget this debt!"

<b>

Am I being treated to a comedy show?

<b>

"...I don't really care what you say, but alright—I'll think of a slightly stricter menu for Shin."

<b>

As I said that, the color drained from Shin's face. He must have imagined a schedule that would be even busier than now.

In contrast to Shin, Suzu and Laika were laughing cheerfully. Their power dynamics were becoming clear.

<b>

Feeling a bit sorry for him, I quickly told Shin, "Just kidding."

Where did that confident expression from earlier go...? He placed a hand on his chest and let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

<b>

The tasks I assigned them were to level one primary class to 30 and two secondary classes to the level where they could gain player bonuses.

<b>

Shin and Laika had Knight, Heavy Knight, and Martial Swordsman.

Suzu had Knight, Heavy Knight, and Sage.

<b>

I judged that they had sufficient skill and instructed them to level up in C-rank dungeons. I thought they might struggle a bit, but it seems I underestimated their capabilities.

<b>

"Alright, then it's time for the next stage. Shin will level up to 30 as a Hero, Laika as a Swordmaster, and Suzu as a Barrier Mage, and then the three of you will conquer a B-rank dungeon. Of course, challenge it with level 80 classes."

<b>

"...Together, the three of us?"

<b>

"Don't worry, you guys can definitely win."

<b>

After all, they were able to fight on the third floor even without knowing about the existence of player bonuses. In a world where level and stats matter.

<b>

As for them—like Shin's stats, they used to look like this.

<b>

<b>

☆Stats☆

<b>

<b>

Name: Shin

Age: 27

Class: Swordmaster

Level: 80

STR: C

VIT: D

AGI: E

DEX: F

INT: G

MND: F

Skills: Presence Detection, Sky Blade, Adversity

<b>

<b>

By the way, it seems he hasn't leveled his primary class to 50, so he doesn't know the skill "Double Slash" that can be acquired at level 50 for swordsmen.

<b>

And now, his stats should have changed with the addition of three new bonuses.

<b>

<b>

☆Stats☆

<b>

<b>

Name: Shin

Age: 27

Class: Swordmaster

Level: 80

STR: B

VIT: B

AGI: E

DEX: F

INT: G

MND: F

Skills: Presence Detection, Sky Blade, Adversity

<b>

<b>

Even if one player bonus is added to this stat, it won't reach the border line of "one B, two Cs or more" to challenge a B-rank dungeon, but their skills should compensate for that.

<b>

Moreover, I had prepared insurance for them.

<b>

In front of the anxious-looking Shin and the others, I laid out something I took from my inventory. It was a glass bottle containing emerald green liquid.

<b>

"Don't be so scared. You can use this if things get dangerous."

<b>

When I said that, Shin pointed at what was lined up on the table, repeatedly opening and closing his mouth like a fish washed ashore. Are you breathing through your gills?

<b>

"Is this...?"

<b>

"Yeah, it's an elixir. I went to the dungeon during the breaks in the meetings."

<b>

I barely had time and, like Shin, could only level one primary class and two secondary classes to 30.

By the way, the classes I leveled were Mage, Swordmaster, and Barrier Mage.

<b>

The reason our leveling pace was the same was simply due to the speed of defeating enemies and the fact that I was diving solo—plus, after raising my STR with the player bonus from Swordmaster level 30, I had been leveling up in B-rank dungeons.

<b>

On days when there were no meetings, I was diving from morning till night. The elixirs were obtained during that time.

<b>

Confirmed drops are indeed delicious.

<b>

"You conquered it with Sera, right...?"

<b>

Suzu asked cautiously.

<b>

"Solo. I had Sera leveling up Mr. Phenon."

<b>

When I said that, Laika looked at me with a deadpan expression and spoke.

<b>

"I've been thinking for a while, but SR is a little... insane, isn't he?"

<b>

"Not just a little. This guy is quite insane."

<b>

Hey, what are you saying freely? I'll confiscate that elixir.

<b>

After shrugging and sighing, I tried to steer the conversation back on track.

<b>

"I don't need money. I have plenty, and once the information about the derived secondary—derived advanced classes spreads, it will eventually become available at a reasonable price."

<b>

In reality, it will probably be after I mention the third classes.

<b>

"Legendary elixirs can be bought normally...?"

<b>

"It's hard to believe, but here they are right in front of us, three of them."

<b>

"That's impossible."

<b>

"You'll get used to it soon—so, how about the others? Are there any who could conquer a B-rank dungeon once they get the information about derived advanced classes?"

<b>

When I asked that, Shin crossed his arms and pondered before saying, "If they don't have to be explorers..."

<b>

"It would be the kingdom's knight order. That guy is there too."

<b>

"That guy?"

<b>

"My friend, in a one-on-one, my win rate is about 60-70%. The knight order probably has the information first, and he's quite strong."

<b>

"Shin is saying that much?"

<b>

If that's the case, then they indeed have a chance to conquer a B-rank dungeon.

If they level up their derived secondary classes to the maximum level, they should be able to utilize their skills to conquer it.

<b>

I wonder what kind of person he is? Is he someone like the muscular Regulus?

<b>

Seeing my expression, not just Shin but also Suzu and Laika wore mischievous grins.

<b>

"What are you laughing at?"

<b>

Did I say something funny?

Seeing my dissatisfied face, Shin laughed out loud. Is this revenge for earlier?

<b>

"The name of that friend is Ray. —Ray Bernault, Sera's older brother."

<b>

"Oh..."

<b>

Sera's brother, huh.

<b>

I wonder if there's any connection between her reluctance to go home and her capable brother in the knight order?
