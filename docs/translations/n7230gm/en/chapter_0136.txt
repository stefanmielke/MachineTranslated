The next day.

<b>

Noah and I visited the Explorer Guild early in the morning. The reason, of course, was to deal with the troublesome matter that came up last night.

<b>

We were using the usual soundproof private room. Sitting across the table was the Thunderbolt's Trajectory, whom I hadn't seen in a long time, lounging on the sofa.

Suzu and Laika were as usual, but Shin still looked like he hadn't fully woken up and wasn't in his best condition—still weak in the mornings as always.

<b>

"…I thought I was suddenly called out, only to have to get beaten up by you."

<b>

"That's your own fault. It's because of what you said, Shin."

<b>

"Esuar, feel free to beat him up. Our leader has been floating ever since winning the International Martial Arts Tournament."

<b>

"That's not true… I wanted to have a nice, slow chat since it's been a while since we met."

<b>

"Whose fault do you think it is, huh?"

<b>

At the harsh words from the women, the leader responded with a deep sigh. I feel the same way, Shin; I want to sigh too.

<b>

To convince Jill and Arnold, I proposed a familiar one-on-one match.

While it might be fun to battle against Thunderbolt's Trajectory, ASR, and the Vinzett siblings all at once in a nine-to-one scenario, I decided against it since it would be bad if someone happened to see that.

<b>

So, we decided to fight in a dungeon where there would be no chance of anyone seeing us, despite the limit on the number of participants.

<b>

The members entering were the Vinzett siblings, Noah, Shin, and me, totaling five.

We planned to meet up with Sera and Phenon in the afternoon, so if we could wrap things up quickly, we could return to our usual daily life.

<b>

After that, it would be best if Shin and the others could move to Lenas with us and we could relax and chat there.

If I could be greedy, I'd like to sleep at the Lenas base tonight. Staying at inns every day makes me miss home.

<b>

"Since the princesses were acting separately, it's fine, but how did Sera manage to hold back? Didn't she say, 'I want to go too!' or something?"

<b>

When Shin said that, the other two party members seemed to share the same question, looking at me with puzzled expressions. No one is going to comment on Shin's creepy voice imitation, huh?

<b>

"She got drunk and passed out before we could even talk about it yesterday."

<b>

"My brother carried her home, but she didn't wake up until the end. She's probably still sleeping at home."

<b>

I think she'll be asleep until around noon. That's usually how it goes when someone gets completely drunk.

At our words, the three in front of us all shared a wry smile.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After a brief greeting to Regulus, we left the guild and headed to the meeting place, the F-rank dungeon.

I thought we might part ways with Suzu and Laika here, but they decided to join us, saying, "It'll be over soon anyway."

<b>

Well, we planned to clear out the enemies on the very easy first floor and have a match within ten minutes until the countdown timer hit zero, so we wouldn't keep them waiting for long.

<b>

That aside— 

<b>

"Even though it's a time when there are fewer people, I let my guard down."

<b>

Just seconds after leaving the guild, Thunderbolt's Trajectory was quickly surrounded by a large crowd of fans. I stood off to the side, blankly watching the scene that reminded me of a swarm of ants.

<b>

Thinking about it, they had just had a parade yesterday, so it was a bit predictable that it would turn out like this.

However, since Shin and the others are close friends of mine, I completely forgot that they had become famous. What a blunder.

<b>

"Shall we go ahead without them?"

<b>

"If Shin brings a crowd with him later, it won't mean anything… Hmm… Maybe we can have Suzu and Laika hold them off while we go from above."

<b>

I hadn't tried it outside the dungeon, but it should be fine. The knights should have enough stamina for this, and as members of ASR, Noah and I wouldn't raise any eyebrows.

<b>

"Here we go—"

<b>

With a shout, I kicked the ground hard and jumped high into the air. As expected, I landed on the roof of a nearby inn, and almost simultaneously, Noah landed right next to me. It seems she read my thoughts and jumped at the same time.

<b>

"Hey! Shin! Over here! Suzu and the others can take their time coming later!"

<b>

"—Huh!? O-Okay!"

<b>

Shin, who turned his gaze toward us, had a moment of surprise but quickly moved to a less crowded area and jumped onto the roof without hesitation. Looks like he's experienced.

<b>

"Suzu and Laika sent a message—'Lunch is on us'—I feel like my mind-reading is being used as a communication tool."

<b>

"That's because you lack the dignity of a god."

<b>

"That's not true!"

<b>

It's probably because of how she talks. Well, to put it positively, it means she's that approachable.

<b>

Suzu and the others probably didn't treat her this way when they first met Noah. They must have no doubt that Noah is a god, considering they watched me and Noah under the care of the loli goddess.

<b>

Yet, now they feel like friends with Noah. This is likely a result of Noah trying to blend in as a resident of this world.

<b>

"Hey, hey, don't fight in such a conspicuous place… Let's hurry and get out of here."

<b>

"…Don't say that in front of Regulus."

<b>

"Huh? Why not??"

<b>

Well, why not—of course, right?

<b>

"Come on, stop joking around and let's hurry. If we take too long, more people will show up."

<b>

Saying that in an exasperated tone, Noah lightly hopped to the next roof with a soft thud. Maybe it's because she's light or because she handles her body well… I need to learn from her.

<b>

"I wasn't trying to joke around…"

<b>

As I muttered in dissatisfaction, Shin followed after Noah.

It feels strange to be jumping around in the city like this, especially when fighting monsters would be different. If this were Earth, it would cause a huge commotion.

<b>

"That's what they call collective responsibility."

<b>

I lightly tapped Shin's back as he caught up and he scratched his head with a pitiful expression, saying, "I can't help it."

<b>

All things considered, he's pretty easygoing.
