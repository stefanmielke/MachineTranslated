# A-19 Unconscious Avoidance

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I stepped outside the dungeon, the sunlight had already vanished, and in its place, countless stars that seemed to hide were shining brightly as if asserting their existence to one another.

<b>

I wonder if any of the stars I know are among them—how romantic it would be if we were all looking at the same stars, even if we lived in different places... I thought to myself.

The people I want to cherish right now are all in this world, though.

<b>

"Where should we eat dinner?"

<b>

"Since we’re at it, let’s go to a place we haven’t been to before."

<b>

When I lived in the royal castle grounds before the collapse, the places I could go were limited because I was often concerned about being seen and there were many topics I couldn’t discuss openly.

<b>

However, having gotten used to the gazes and the interest of the local residents in us fading, I now live quite freely in the commercial city of Reinas.

It could also be said that the loss of my title as 'Hero' is one of the factors.

<b>

"That’s true. Since we always went to the same places in the royal capital, we might discover something new."

<b>

Currently, the three of us walking through the royal capital are me, Noah, and Sera.

Arnold, who had been with us until just a moment ago, seemed to have plans to meet someone, so he parted ways with us when we arrived in the royal capital.

He had been casting lingering glances at Noah and Sera until the end, but it seemed he wasn’t the type to stand someone up, so he reluctantly left.

<b>

"Shall we wander around the city a bit? Even though the parade is over, it seems the festival mode is still ongoing."

<b>

Compared to during the day, there are considerably fewer people, but since the food stalls are still set up, many people are still walking around with drinks. A familiar explorer waved at me as we passed each other, so I waved back casually.

They feel more like work colleagues than friends. Unlike when I was a working adult on Earth, the relationship is much more relaxed.

<b>

"—Huh!? By the way, big brother! You said you’d treat me to yakitori in the dungeon, right!?"

<b>

I didn’t say that. I thought about it, but I didn’t actually say it.

<b>

"That’s basically the same as saying it!"

<b>

"Ah, both of you. I have no idea what you’re talking about, so could you please stop that kind of conversation...?"

<b>

With a sulky and somewhat lonely expression, Sera said.

As Sera pointed out, anyone listening would be confused. I feel sorry about that.

I might get scolded for saying this, but her dejected face was really cute.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Sera. Um, right now, big brother is thinking, 'Sera’s expression is cute.'"

<b>

"—Huh!? SR!?"

<b>

You unnecessary little brat! 

<b>

Receiving an unexpected response from Noah, Sera displayed a mix of shock, embarrassment, and confusion, stepping back a pace from me. I couldn’t help but twitch my cheeks.

<b>

"Ah, no, um... well, you see... sorry."

<b>

People with rich romantic experiences would probably say something clever and smoothly navigate through this situation. It would be nice if I could level up in this aspect in the dungeon, but unfortunately, this world doesn’t work that way.

<b>

Living surrounded by women, I should have grown a bit more.

Really, love is complicated.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

In a somewhat awkward atmosphere, we strolled around the city.

As promised, I treated Noah to yakitori and also bought some for Sera and myself to replenish our energy. After that, we spent about ten minutes looking for a restaurant that seemed good for dinner.

<b>

We found a cozy little place a bit off the main street.

It had a modest appearance that didn’t strongly assert itself as a restaurant. However, there was a sign saying "Open" on the door, and a small plate with recommended menu items was hanging.

<b>

Since this world is based on games, there are many Japanese foods.

<b>

Of course, there are also foods and dishes that don’t exist in Japan or in games, but they aren’t very tasty. They’re the kind of flavors that make you think, "I’m good after trying it once."

<b>

"I think I’ll go with omurice."

<b>

"I’ll decide after looking at the menu inside the restaurant. There should be more options than what’s written here."

<b>

"I guess I’ll do the same. If nothing particularly catches my eye, I’ll go for the steak set."

<b>

Looking through the glass, I saw that there were a few empty tables inside.

There didn’t seem to be any shady characters or drunks who might bother us, so I thought we should settle on this place—just then,

<b>

"Someone’s coming from behind, aiming for you, big brother."

<b>

"Y-Yeah, got it."

<b>

I replied shortly and turned around while being cautious of the presence.

Then, I saw a girl who looked slightly older than Noah walking straight toward me.

Her light purple hair, resembling violets, didn’t match anyone in the character encyclopedia in my memory. With a combative smile plastered on her face, she approached slowly without breaking her stride.

According to my sense of presence, there was no malicious intent—however, Noah said she was somehow targeting me.

<b>

Noah, who can read minds, probably understands the specifics better, but it didn’t seem like I had time to confirm that.

The moment I tried to stop Sera, who was about to step in front of me, the girl made a strong step forward with her right foot. In an instant, she closed the distance between us and quickly pulled back her arm, gathering strength into her fist.

<b>

"...Huh?"

<b>

At this moment, I made a very big mistake.

It wasn’t an instinctive reaction—but rather an unconscious response based on experience.

<b>

Her arm length, leg position, stance—judging from the massive amount of information flowing into my brain, I tried to deduce how to move my body to achieve the best evasion.

<b>

But—

<b>

"What are you trying to do?"

<b>

Without needing to move, her attack didn’t land.

The punch, launched from a beautiful form, stopped just a few centimeters from my nose.

It seemed she hadn’t intended to hit me at all; she just wanted to surprise me.

<b>

Caught off guard by the suddenness, I waited for the girl to answer my question, and after a moment of wide-eyed surprise, she quickly tightened her expression and thrust her fist right next to my face—close enough to touch my earlobe.

<b>

"So what? What do you mean by suddenly attacking me?"

<b>

I avoided that attack by slightly tilting my head.

I can’t deny that I live a life that could provoke jealousy from men, but I don’t recall doing anything to be attacked by a girl like this. What on earth is wrong with this child?

<b>

"Big brother, that’s not good..."

<b>

Noah, who probably understood the situation the best, muttered with a tone mixed with exasperation. No, I don’t get it. Normally, you would dodge.

<b>

"What’s not good about it? Anyone can see that this girl is the one in the wrong, right? Can I catch her now?"

<b>

Sera said in a calm tone, but her voice was laced with anger.

However, Noah shook her head in response. Then, with a sigh as if she had given up on something, she continued speaking.

<b>

"It seems she wanted to test your strength, big brother—You know, big brother, I think she’s quite skilled among explorers? It’s normal to be surprised by her attack or not be able to dodge. You can’t underestimate her."

<b>

With gestures that seemed to say "Good grief," Noah mentioned something ominous that one wouldn’t expect from her appearance or expression, saying, "Should I silence her?" The girl displayed a look of shock and took a step back from us.

<b>

Ah... so that’s what it is. I finally understand.

<b>

I’m particularly unremarkable and am considered the errand boy of ASR. Therefore, my reaction to her attack was incorrect.

It seems I need to practice acting surprised and pretending to get hit by attacks.

<b>

"Silencing—rather, I want to hear her out first. There must be a reason she targeted me."

<b>

"That’s right. So, does that mean we can’t eat at this restaurant?"

<b>

"…Yeah. Then let’s go to the usual soundproof private room. We’ll take this girl with us."

<b>

As we all let out a big sigh in front of the trembling girl— 

<b>

"—Hah, hah... Jill, don’t wander off on your own—Wait, Lady Noah!? Ah, the night world is coloring up..."

<b>

The one who appeared was the self-proclaimed strongest man of the Rezel Kingdom—Arnold Vinzett. The moment he saw Noah, his eyes instantly turned into hearts. He’s as consistent as ever.

<b>

...Huh? Did he just say "Jill"?

Does that mean this girl is Arnold’s sister, Jill Vinzett? With that appearance?

<b>

According to what Arnold said, she was participating in the international martial arts tournament and boasts the strongest strength in the Rezel Kingdom without weapons— 

<b>

"Ah... indeed. This is bad."

<b>

It seems I shouldn’t have easily avoided her attack. In fact, avoiding it might have been a mistake.

As Noah said, I need to ask Arnold to keep my existence a secret as well.

<b>

Above all, gently.
