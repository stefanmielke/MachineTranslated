# 15 Non-negotiable Things

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Last night, Her Highness the Princess's condition worsened. The deadline is in 10 days."

<b>

Regulus said with a face like he had bitten into a bitter bug. The room was enveloped in silence for a few seconds.

<b>

"—N-no way... Please tell me it's a lie!"

<b>

Sera, sitting next to me, shouted in a pained voice.

Without turning my face, I could tell exactly what kind of expression she had. It was that kind of voice.

<b>

I, too, was left dumbfounded, my mouth agape at the sudden news.

<b>

Why hadn’t I considered that possibility?

Why had I thought there was still plenty of time?

<b>

—What a waste. Worrying about the past won’t change anything.

<b>

At this rate, it’s impossible. I need to rethink the plan.

I placed my hand on my chin, closed my eyes to concentrate, and looked down.

<b>

"Please understand. I wouldn't lie about something like this."

<b>

"—Ah! That's right! There's SR! SR was level 1 just ten days ago, but has already cleared a C-rank dungeon! You can do it, can't you!?"

<b>

It seems she called my name. Was she talking about me?

<b>

"Did you say something?"

<b>

"I did! If it's SR, then in ten days, you can clear a B-rank dungeon, right!? Right!?"

<b>

She pleaded with me. I shook my head.

<b>

"—It's impossible. No matter how you look at it, there's not enough time."

<b>

If this were a game where I could reset after losing, I wouldn't hesitate to challenge it right away.

<b>

But this is reality.

<b>

Losing means death. I don't have the strong heart to gamble my life so easily.

<b>

"—I see. To be honest, I had hoped for a miracle... but if you say it's impossible, then it probably is. I heard you’ve been diving into dungeons all day since the day you were summoned. I'm not saying this to be harsh... but you should take a break."

<b>

Regulus said in a weak voice. I felt that his words also carried the meaning of "give up on the princess."

<b>

Did he think I would just say, "Okay, I understand"?

That's impossible. While I can't gamble my life, I have things I won't compromise on.

I said it was impossible, but that was only in terms of the current situation.

<b>

"Please don't talk to me for a bit; I need to think."

<b>

I can't concentrate if I'm being spoken to.

<b>

The knowledge and skills I possess.

The strength needed to clear a B-rank dungeon.

What I can do and what I can't.

What is needed.

And the things I won't compromise on.

<b>

I began to organize my thoughts.

<b>

...Alright. I think I’m okay now. The next step is to figure out what to do about this situation—.

<b>

"You, who just came from another world, shouldn't risk your life for this. This is fundamentally about this world—"

<b>

"Guild Master. He told you to be quiet. Please be silent."

<b>

"…Understood."

<b>

I thought I heard a voice, but it quickly fell silent. I wasn't sure, but now I could concentrate again.

<b>

How long had I been lost in thought? About ten minutes? No, maybe just one or two.

<b>

However, thanks to my concentration, I could see a chance of victory.

With this method, I should be able to clear it in eight days, not ten.

<b>

<b>

I raised my head and looked alternately at Regulus and Sera.

Regulus had a displeased expression and was tightly closing his mouth. Sera looked like she was expecting something.

<b>

"Don't worry. I will definitely save the princess. I made a promise to her."

<b>

I told the two of them with a smile.

A man who has reached the summit wouldn't give up over something like this, right? There's no way I would admit defeat in this world.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Is that really true!?

<b>

After calming the two who were bubbling with excitement, I decided to convey the plan I had constructed in my mind.

<b>

"Yes. But before that, I have a few conditions."

<b>

"Go ahead. If there's something I can do— but."

<b>

"I’m the same as the Guild Master. I will do anything."

<b>

A girl saying she will do anything should not be taken lightly— I thought in my mind as I conveyed the conditions to the two.

<b>

"It will be me and Sera for sure, but we need three more— collaborators. It would be preferable if they have experience in the lower levels of a B-rank dungeon."

<b>

A dungeon can accommodate a maximum of five people per room. I want to do everything possible to increase the odds.

<b>

"In that case, it would be 'Thunderbolt's Trail.' They are a three-person party with B-rank licenses."

<b>

"I've heard that name before."

<b>

I believe they were the ones Sera had a dispute with. A blonde pretty boy and two girls. I think they were said to be the best in the country.

<b>

But I wonder if Sera will be okay? Given the previous incident, I hope there won't be any infighting in the dungeon.

<b>

As I thought that and looked at Sera, she nodded.

<b>

"I will persuade them."

<b>

She seemed determined.

In just one day, her attitude towards me had changed 180 degrees. Did she talk to the princess about something?

Ah, no, no. That's not what we should be discussing right now.

<b>

"No. I will do the persuading. They are likely to want the knowledge that they are missing while they are stuck in a B-rank dungeon. Sera, please bring them to the guild by 7 AM tomorrow."

<b>

"I see... understood. I will bring them by any means necessary."

<b>

"Please do it gently."

<b>

At this point, she seems like she would drag them in even if she had to tie them up. For the sake of my peace of mind, I shouldn't think too deeply about it.

<b>

Now, what’s next—?

<b>

"I plan to discuss something that shouldn't be publicly disclosed with Regulus, Sera, and the three from Thunderbolt's Trail. Can we create a non-disclosure agreement?"

<b>

What I want to convey to them is the existence of player bonuses and the secondary derived classes. Since my status screen already shows the secondary derived classes, it should be persuasive.

<b>

"I don't mind that, but— does that mean we can't discuss it with His Majesty or Lord Dino?"

<b>

"Yes. I would prefer if you could refrain from doing so."

<b>

When I answered that, Regulus frowned.

Trust of the royal family. The life of the princess— it seems he is weighing those on a scale.

<b>

I don't want to reveal too many of my cards, and even if His Majesty and the others knew, it wouldn't save the princess's life. In other words, there are only disadvantages.

I like to stand out like "That guy is amazing," but I don't want to be tied down because of it.

<b>

"However, I think it will be easy to deceive, so as long as you don't talk about it yourselves, it won't be discovered."

<b>

I won't reveal the existence of player bonuses to the kingdom, but I intend to convey only the secondary derived classes. If it's just the secondary derived classes, even the residents of this world could explain it as a coincidence of discovery.

<b>

This will also contribute to the overall strengthening of the world, and eventually, someone will notice the existence of third classes. If that happens, acquiring elixirs will become easier, and the number of people suffering like the princess should decrease.

Even so, reaching the Overlord class will probably be impossible.

<b>

My plan is to have a total of four people, including Thunderbolt's Trail and Sera, acquire player bonuses within a week.

Even though the members of Thunderbolt's Trail will be forced to play the role of vanguard, if I dangle the secondary derived classes as bait, they will likely go along with it.

<b>

"Let's discuss the details tomorrow. For now, we can't start unless the people from Thunderbolt's Trail cooperate, so let's talk at the guild at 7 AM tomorrow."

<b>

"I have many concerns, but... understood. I will also cooperate. I will prepare."

<b>

"I will go talk to Thunderbolt's Trail now. SR, are you going to the dungeon?"

<b>

"Yes. I think the dungeon will open soon, so I will dive into a C-rank dungeon until night. Sera, I think you will be busy starting tomorrow, so please rest your body today and don't dive into the dungeon."

<b>

"I think SR should be the one to rest... understood. Fenon— may I go see Her Highness the princess?"

<b>

"Well, you don't need my permission for that. Please feel free to do as you like. Please give my regards to the princess."

<b>

"Ah. I will convey that."

<b>

The anxiety had already disappeared from her face.

It seems she truly trusts me. To meet Sera's expectations, I can't slack off. Of course, I never intended to do so.

<b>

Thus, we each began to move to fulfill our respective roles.

<b>

The day of the decisive battle is fast approaching.
