# 109 To a New World

<b>

<b>

<b>

I pushed Noah away, and the moment I realized that Venom's attack would hit me, I instantly predicted the attack's position from the enemy's line of sight. To avoid vital areas like the heart and brain that would result in a one-hit KO, I twisted my body in mid-air to the limit.

<b>

And for some reason, I found myself in a different place. Moreover, I was floating in mid-air in a bizarre pose.

<b>

No matter which direction I looked, it was pure white, with some slight variations in shade, allowing me to somewhat grasp the sense of distance—such a place.

<b>

In that incomprehensible place, I encountered a mysterious girl in a kimono.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I had heard that half of my soul was living on Earth, but it seems to be moving normally... It's really quite unsettling. I mean, from the outside, I really look like an old man... on Earth."

<b>

Sitting cross-legged in mid-air, I muttered to myself absentmindedly. And I was somewhat shocked.

<b>

In the image projected by the Creator God—Lady Idea, a lackluster 33-year-old NEET was repeatedly stabbing Venom's body with White Lotus, as if he had found the enemy of his parents.

I couldn't hear the audio, but for some reason, he seemed to be angry. Since he lost his left arm as my substitute, it's not impossible that he was frustrated about that. If that's the case, I'm sorry.

<b>

"It seems Venom has safely died."

<b>

Lady Idea, who was watching the image right next to me, nodded and said that.

She dismissed the image with a gesture as if swatting away a fly, then smoothly moved through the air like an astronaut and came in front of me.

<b>

"With this, Noah's boy should not disappear. A new world will soon be created."

<b>

"I see. I don't really feel it, though."

<b>

Will everything really end here, and will I be able to reunite with Sera and the others?

I would likely have lost my memories, but that is now a trivial issue. If I can meet them again, that is enough for me.

<b>

I spent many long years challenging Venom, an enemy I could call my arch-nemesis—though I let my guard down at the end, I somehow managed to defeat him. This should have fulfilled my long-cherished wish, yet I feel no sense of that.

<b>

"When humans gain something too great, they cannot understand it immediately."

<b>

Lady Idea spoke to me in a comforting tone as the tension within me snapped.

I had heard from Noah that she was a great goddess, so I was initially nervous, but her unexpectedly friendly demeanor put me at ease.

<b>

"Are you not angry about my leaving Earth, Lady Idea?"

<b>

I suddenly asked a question that had been on my mind.

Upon reflection, I was essentially saying to the Creator God of Earth, "I prefer another world to Earth, so let me go there," and it felt somewhat disrespectful.

<b>

I was prepared for at least a little scolding, but Lady Idea laughed and said, "You need not worry about it."

<b>

"The best thing is for you to live in a world where you can find joy. I respect your will. Well, since you are a soul born in the world I created, I will watch over you for a while."

<b>

"That's too much for someone like me... but thank you."

<b>

"Transfers and reincarnations are not something that happens frequently. Moreover, I will receive proper compensation from Noah."

<b>

"Compensation, you say?"

<b>

Now that I think about it, Noah had mentioned something about a contract with the Creator God of Earth, right?

But that was supposed to be about returning me if I wished to "go back to Earth," so... is this something entirely different?

<b>

"It is a matter between gods. So it is not something for you to worry about. You may hear about it from Noah later."

<b>

Lady Idea said this with a somewhat amused expression and clapped her hands once.

<b>

"That aside, let’s talk about what’s to come. The new world Noah created has been reverted to the time when you were summoned. In other words, it is in a state where time is progressing as if you were not summoned."

<b>

"...? Has a new world really been created already? Isn't that a bit too soon? Noah was in rough shape, and it should take time for recovery—"

<b>

"Time is a trivial matter for us. We can simply shift the time of this space relative to the time of Noah's world."

<b>

Is it really that simple? Or is this Lady Idea special?

<b>

I have a feeling it leans more towards the latter.

<b>

Moreover, Lady Idea said, "Time is progressing," but does that mean I will not set foot back on that land until a little later than when I was summoned?

As I pondered this, Lady Idea opened her mouth.

<b>

"It should be around the time an A-rank dungeon was cleared."

<b>

It seems that gods from any world respond to inner thoughts in the same way. Perhaps because I had been having similar exchanges with Noah for a long time, I felt no particular discomfort with this. Whether this is a good change remains unclear.

<b>

"So I will be reuniting with the girls who spent time without me... If Fenon or Sera had married someone else, I might cry."

<b>

"Fufu—there's no need to worry about that. They remain single."

<b>

"Haha, well then. I'm not sure if I should be happy about that, but for now, I'm relieved."

<b>

I wonder how the girls are spending their time in the world where I was not summoned. I imagine them struggling to clear B-rank dungeons without knowing about player bonuses or secondary and tertiary classes.

<b>

—Wait, isn't that bad!?

<b>

"Fenon!? Is she alright!?"

<b>

If I had not been summoned, the elixir to heal Fenon would not have arrived in time. I do not intend to overestimate my abilities, but I cannot believe that Shin and Sera—the inhabitants of that world could clear a B-rank dungeon without me.

<b>

And creating a world where Fenon is not sick would be difficult. After all, Fenon lost her marriage prospects with other countries due to her illness, and both the past and present would change significantly.

<b>

"Do not worry. She has been safely healed with the elixir. As for why they were able to clear the B-rank dungeon—it's best to see for yourself in the new world."

<b>

Lady Idea chuckled, covering her mouth with her hand. For some reason, my reaction seemed amusing to her.

<b>

After laughing for a while, she reached out her hand straight toward me. Then, as she turned her palm toward me, at that moment—my body began to emit a soft light like that of fireflies.

<b>

If my prediction is correct, it seems I will soon be parting ways with Lady Idea.

<b>

"The new world may not be the same as the game you know. For a while, I will manage the world in place of Noah."

<b>

My body gradually disappeared as if the strings were being untied from my fingertips.

I tried to voice a response to the goddess's words, but no sound came from my throat as I intended. Is this the effect of the transfer?

Reluctantly, I attempted to communicate through the inner voice I had cultivated during my exchanges with Noah.

If Lady Idea is managing things, what will happen to Noah?

<b>

"You will know soon enough. Enjoy your new life, Rokudo Shuui—no, SR."

<b>

With a youthful appearance, Lady Idea spoke in a voice and expression that conveyed a sense of motherhood.

Suddenly, a wave of drowsiness washed over me, and my vision began to blur accordingly.

As I could no longer recognize Lady Idea's expression—her form, and just as my consciousness was about to fade, I heard a gentle voice.

<b>

<b>

"To SR and—those dear to you, blessings."
