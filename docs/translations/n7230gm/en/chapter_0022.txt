# 21 Unexpected Situation

<b>

<b>

<b>

The B-rank dungeon, our destination, is located a 20-minute walk from the royal capital. It's a distance where one might consider using a horse, but we chose to walk.

<b>

Why? Because I can't ride a horse! Got a problem with that?

<b>

Sera suggested, "Want to ride together?" but my pride as a man got in the way, and I ended up saying, "I'm in the mood to walk."

Back in school, I had dreams of having my girlfriend ride on the back of my bicycle—but I really don't want my wishes to come true on a horse. Plus, I'd be the one in the back.

<b>

During the journey, when I asked the members of Thunderbolt's Trail about their experience, they seemed very excited, saying that the D-rank dungeon was a piece of cake and that they were still doubting whether it was a dream or not—sharing their joy with gleeful expressions.

<b>

They promised they wouldn't leak it to anyone else, which reassured me. After all, there’s a contract, so they wouldn’t do something like that.

<b>

"Is SR okay? You look a bit better, but you don't seem 100%," 

<b>

Shin asked as we walked along the road, roughly halfway between the royal capital and the dungeon.

<b>

"Yeah, I can't say I'm in perfect condition," 

<b>

"Hey, hey, are you really okay? You're going to face a dungeon boss, you know? How are you going to manage like that?"

<b>

"Exactly. If you suddenly tell us, 'Leave the boss to me,' that would be a problem."

<b>

"Ahaha, I wouldn't say something like that. But if you seem to be okay, it would help if you could let me rest a bit."

<b>

I'm sleepy.

<b>

I had a rather unsatisfactory sleep, and now my desire for sleep is overwhelming. My basic needs are all out of whack.

I'm not in a state where I'd stumble around, but I just feel like I want to dive into bed and lose consciousness.

Right now, if I saw a sign for "Free Trial of Massage Chair" at an electronics store, I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation, even if I had no intention of buying one. Though, such things don't exist in this world.

<b>

"Even if you want to sleep, there are no rest areas near the dungeon, you know?"

<b>

Sera said while peering into my face. It seems she is trying to gauge my health by looking at me.

<b>

Sera said that, but I’m not asking for the luxury of resting in a designated area. I always keep a pillow in my inventory so I can sleep anywhere, anytime.

<b>

"If the members of Thunderbolt's Trail are around, I think they can handle up to the third floor without Sera. Is that not okay?"

<b>

I know I'm being selfish, but I want to face this with a clear mind; otherwise, even the slightest anxiety will linger. It's an emergency, but my current status isn't suited for challenging a B-rank dungeon.

<b>

"Are you planning to sleep inside the dungeon?"

<b>

"…Is that really not okay? I thought it might be fine if Sera was keeping watch. Of course, I'll wake up properly from the fourth floor."

<b>

In any case, I have to conserve my stamina for the boss fight because of my VIT issue. I could follow behind them, but if I'm going to be idle, I’d rather sleep.

<b>

"That's fine, right? I want to see how much this party has grown. Until now, I was always battered when we cleared the third floor. But now, it shouldn't be like that, right?"

<b>

It seems Raika is on my side.

She said brightly to Shin and Suzu.

<b>

"That's true. I also want to see how much I've grown."

<b>

As we walked, Shin crossed his arms.

About ten seconds later, he said, "Alright," giving his consent.

<b>

"We'll take care of the monsters up to the third floor. However, depending on the situation, we might need you to wake up early."

<b>

"Yes, of course. Thank you for your consideration."

<b>

I bowed my head slightly while internally doing a fist pump of "Yes!"

Based on the strength of the three of them, I estimate that it would take about an hour and a half for each floor. Even though I would have to wake up each time we change floors, I could sleep for nearly five hours.

<b>

I hope everything goes smoothly without any problems.

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

The B-rank dungeon located north of the Lindale Kingdom's royal capital is of the grassland type. I have memories of circling this place during the game in search of elixirs, so I know all the details by heart.

<b>

The boss monster is a giant cyclops, about five meters tall.

<b>

If I challenge it in perfect condition, I have a 100% chance of winning. Not "almost," but definitely—without a doubt.

If I mess up like that, I won't stand a chance against the Demon King Venom. Being able to do that is what makes one at the top.

<b>

As I predicted, Thunderbolt's Trail smoothly cleared from the first to the third floor.

There were some moments where they sustained minor injuries, but it seems Suzu's healing and the potions they had prepared worked well to treat them.

Suzu, whose INT had increased and healing power had risen, seemed very happy about it. I was asleep, so I didn't see that scene.

<b>

Despite having gained strength, Sera had no chance to show her skills because she was guarding me, and she looked a bit dissatisfied.

<b>

"Alright! From here on out, it's my turn!"

<b>

As if to vent her frustration, Sera teleported to the fourth floor with a fierce smile, swinging her sword as if there were monsters right in front of her.

<b>

"You might be able to reach the fifth floor without you."

<b>

Watching Sera, Shin said. He seemed happy, probably because he successfully cleared the third floor.

In his case, he must have increased his AGI by acquiring the fighter's player bonus. It's a particularly valuable stat in close combat.

<b>

"That may be true, but having you around is definitely helpful. Plus, it would defeat the purpose of practicing our coordination."

<b>

"Exactly. And since she gained a status bonus, her swordsmanship has improved tremendously. She's almost on par with Shin, right?"

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

Shin and Sera's expressions were contrasting when they were told they were of equal level.

One glared at the other as if in disbelief, while the other puffed out her chest proudly. It's easy to tell which is which without needing to say.

<b>

"Hehe, SR, watch me! My reborn swordsmanship!"

<b>

"Yes, yes. I'm watching, so please be careful not to get hurt."

<b>

"Of course! I’ve never forgotten a promise with you!"

<b>

I definitely told her not to do anything dangerous—I'm sure I did. It seems she remembered that well. If she had forgotten, I would have lectured her.

<b>

"Then, I'll follow from behind, so please take care of things."

<b>

"Ah! Leave it to me!"

<b>

With a thud on her chest, Sera declared.

Thunderbolt's Trail smiled wryly behind her.

<b>

<b>

There was only one monster left on the fourth floor.

Thunderbolt's Trail was a three-person party, while Sera was a solo explorer. Even though we had been together for a few days, I was a bit anxious about how this almost impromptu party would coordinate—but they seemed to be managing well.

<b>

Shin, although he is a swordsman, played the role of tank in the party. He directed the party while taking the enemy's attacks, sometimes deflecting them to hold the enemy back.

<b>

Taking advantage of that opening, Sera and Raika—sometimes even the priest Suzu—would attack.

In Suzu's case, she played a role of distracting the enemy by poking with her spear rather than dealing damage. In that gap, Shin and the others would strike.

<b>

There were many impressive coordinated moves, proving that the title of the kingdom's number one was not just for show.

<b>

Thunderbolt's Trail seemed very happy to be able to defeat monsters from the floors they hadn't reached yet. They cheered with joy each time they took one down.

<b>

<b>

And then, the incident occurred.

<b>

<b>

Sera was also enthusiastically defeating monsters, but she made a grave mistake—she did something she shouldn't have.

<b>

"—Sera! Retreat! Get back now!"

<b>

The fourth floor is inhabited by two-meter-tall, bipedal pig monsters—Orcs. Their weapons are wooden clubs that are about the same size as their height.

Sera stabbed her sword into the chest of the monster, as if to deliver the finishing blow.

<b>

"—Ugh! The sword won't come out!"

<b>

"You idiot! Just leave the sword!"

<b>

Shin shouted as he hurriedly slashed at the Orc's back. However, the Orc ignored that and swung its club horizontally at Sera.

<b>

"—Ugh!"

<b>

A soundless scream.

Sera, hit in her unguarded side, was blown away more than ten meters, rolling, bouncing, and then rolling again, finally coming to a stop, unmoving.

<b>

"Suzu! Heal and potion, now! Raika, keep watch of the surroundings!"

<b>

I shouted and immediately ran toward the Orc.

<b>

I had asked Raika to keep watch, but come to think of it, this Orc was the last one. I was so flustered that I forgot such an obvious thing.

Since no one pointed that out, I ended up feeling embarrassed later on.

<b>

<b>

The Orc, already heavily damaged, was quickly defeated by Shin and me working together.

<b>

That was fine, but the problem was her.

<b>

"…I'm sorry, I let my guard down."

<b>

She was lying down with her head on the pillow I had given her. The spot where she had fallen was now stained with a large pool of blood. She had been coughing up blood due to a wound in her side and internal injuries.

<b>

"I think the healing and potion have treated the wounds to some extent, but since there’s still a lot of blood loss, you shouldn't push yourself."

<b>

"Yeah. You shouldn't stab a sword into a muscle-bound opponent like that, Sera."

<b>

"Ah, I learned that the hard way…"

<b>

For now, it seems her life is not in danger.

I wanted to scold her for her actions, but I also felt guilty for bringing her here, so I couldn't say anything and kept my mouth shut.

<b>

Shin, seeing my state, asked.

<b>

"What do we do? Based on how the fourth floor went, I honestly don't know if the three of us can keep going."

<b>

It felt like he was indirectly asking, "Should we return?" The countdown timer that appeared when we cleared the floor showed two minutes remaining.

<b>

Considering Sera's condition, we should indeed return immediately for her to recuperate. However, if we do that, we would have to start over from the first floor and face the dungeon without Sera.

<b>

After weighing various factors, I decided to proceed.

<b>

"…Do you think you can walk along with us?"

<b>

At my words, the members of Thunderbolt's Trail looked at me with wide eyes.

<b>

Sera might be in the worst condition, but as long as she doesn't engage in intense physical activity, she shouldn't worsen.

However, the princess's life is at stake. I feel bad for Sera, but it would be better for her to endure.

<b>

Sera used her arms, grimacing in pain, but managed to sit up.

<b>

"Of course. I can still fight."

<b>

"That's not okay. Sera, you should just observe. From here on out, I will join the party."

<b>

"—But, if you do that, SR—"

<b>

"Don't worry. It's just like a warm-up before the boss fight."

<b>

I said with a smile, taking her hand. I pulled her up gently.

<b>

"—Ah, I'm sorry."

<b>

As she stood up, she wobbled, and I instinctively caught her. My body tensed up with nervousness, but I quickly let go and asked, "Are you really okay?"

<b>

"I'm fine. As you can see, I'm okay."

<b>

Where are you okay?!—I suppressed the urge to retort and nodded.

Then, I turned to Shin, who had a serious expression.

<b>

<b>

"Let's move on. From here, I will also participate."
