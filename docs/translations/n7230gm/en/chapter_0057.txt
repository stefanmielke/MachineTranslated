# 55 The Thoughts of SR

<b>

<b>

<b>

The match, which was a demonstration by the knight order, and the individual competition that made Sera's abilities known to the world, has ended. As for the excitement in the arena, let's just say it reached a level that would make those who are to compete afterward feel reluctant.

<b>

For the match that concludes this martial arts tournament, my strategy is to fight with strength comparable to Sera's.

Although the type of strength is different from Sera's, if I can defend against the fierce attacks of the Thunderbolt's Trajectory, I can adequately demonstrate my abilities without standing out too much.

<b>

The plan after this involves a lengthy two-hour lunch break, followed by a party battle in which I and the Thunderbolt's Trajectory will participate.

<b>

It was clear that we would have too much time on our hands, so Sera and I decided to return home within the royal castle grounds for a while.

The distance from the arena to my home is about 15 minutes by carriage.

The capital is vast, but since the royal castle is located in the city center, it is convenient that it doesn't take much time to go anywhere.

<b>

I invited the Thunderbolt's Trajectory as well, but it seems they will stay in the arena to comfort Ray, who has suffered a complete defeat to his younger sister.

Shin seemed particularly close to Ray, so perhaps they plan to have a meal together.

<b>

In a way, Fenon, who had left the other royal family members behind, appeared before us in disguise. She was accompanied by a troubled-looking Shiri.

The princess is truly free. From my perspective, which is concerned about those around me, her bold way of living seems dazzling. I want to emulate that.

“Mmm! Sera's fried rice is exquisite no matter when you eat it!”

<b>

“I didn't have much time, so I made something simple. Sorry for the lack of effort.”

<b>

“You say it's a lack of effort, but this is really delicious.”

<b>

It's seriously delicious. So good that I wish a ramen shop would definitely add 'Sera Fried Rice' to their menu.

The only and biggest problem is that there are no ramen shops in this world.

<b>

“Normally, I should have prepared this myself... I'm sorry. It's delicious, Sera-sama.”

<b>

The doghouse of the royal castle—no, my home.

In the end, the usual party members gathered, and it turned into the same situation as when we had a meal in the city of Reinas.

<b>

Lately, we've been having meals together often, so it feels somewhat comforting. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a family gathering.

<b>

Shouldn't we just skip the match? I kind of want to just take a bath and go to sleep like this—though I know that can't happen. Ah, I want to dive into a dungeon.

<b>

“I’m looking forward to your match, SR-sama. I’ll be cheering for you!”

<b>

We decided to leave the house 30 minutes before the match starts, and after finishing our meal, we took a tea break. Sera is next to me, with Fenon and Shiri across from us, the usual arrangement.

<b>

“Thank you. However, since I won’t be fighting seriously, it might be a bit unsatisfying for you, Fenon-san, since you always watch my battles?”

<b>

When I fight against the monsters in the dungeon, I focus on defeating them quickly. At least, it’s not a way of fighting suitable for a large audience.

<b>

“That’s not true! Just seeing you move, SR-sama, is already worth watching! I’m satisfied!”

<b>

Satisfied just by seeing me move—am I an idol or something?

<b>

I can't help but imagine Fenon cheering and clapping, and I inadvertently let out a dry laugh, “Haha…”

<b>

“Besides, if SR were to fight seriously, it would be difficult for even the Thunderbolt's Trajectory to match up. Even though Shin and the others have become stronger, SR is also leveling up.”

<b>

“It would be fine if I could just withstand all their attacks... but completely defending against them would be a problem, and ideally, it would be a close fight since Shin and the others have gotten stronger.”

<b>

“That sounds tough in its own right... But I’m sure SR-sama will be fine.”

<b>

“Thank you, Shiri-san. I’ll do my best.”

<b>

While I could arrange to perform a demonstration like the knight order after discussing it with the Thunderbolt's Trajectory, that would be rather boring. It wouldn’t be fun. It wouldn’t be interesting.

<b>

Even though I say I don’t want to stand out, I don’t want to give up on anything or suppress what I want to do because of that.

It’s probably because of this personality that I ended up receiving a title and participating in a martial arts tournament... yeah, it’s my own fault.

<b>

If I truly wished for it, I could change my name, alter my hairstyle and hair color, and quietly live outside this country.

The reason I don’t do that is that I like this country and don’t want to lose the days spent with Sera and the others. To put it bluntly, it’s my selfishness of “I don’t want this, I don’t want that.”

<b>

“I’m looking forward to what kind of match it will be... It’s not often you get to see a 3-on-1 match, especially when it involves the top of the kingdom.”

<b>

Sera crossed her arms and looked slightly upward as she said that. I wonder if she’s imagining the battle between me and the Thunderbolt's Trajectory.

<b>

“I feel the same way. I have a rough idea of their levels, but if their jobs and skills change, their fighting styles will naturally change as well. I wonder how they plan to coordinate.”

<b>

I mirrored her pose, predicting the match against the Thunderbolt's Trajectory.

As I was doing that, Shiri spoke up, somewhat hesitantly, “Um…”

<b>

“SR-sama, don’t you feel anxious? I know you’re strong, but your opponents are the Thunderbolt's Trajectory…”

<b>

“No matter how strong they become, I have no intention of losing.”

<b>

I do have some anxiety about how the audience will react, though.

<b>

If by any chance I were to lose, I might leave the capital in tears. At that time, I would forcibly take Sera and the others with me.

<b>

“I wonder how it will turn out.”

<b>

I muttered absentmindedly, not addressing anyone in particular.

<b>

I can’t help but be excited about how the Thunderbolt's Trajectory plans to challenge me.

What kind of strategy will they come up with, and how will they try to defeat me?

<b>

Thanks to the ranking battles during the game era, I’m used to fighting in front of a large audience.

And since the Thunderbolt's Trajectory is probably not new to such situations either, they shouldn’t get too tense just because it’s in front of people.

<b>

With all my might, and with the intent to kill—rather, with the intent to defeat.

<b>

I hope they come at me like that.
