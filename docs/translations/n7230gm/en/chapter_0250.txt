# A-133 I Messed Up

<b>

<b>

<b>

While Regulus was notifying various countries that "there might be ASR members coming from your side, so please be prepared" regarding the dungeon created by Lord Idea (which we decided to call an SS rank dungeon), I, Crescent, and Jade had some free time.

<b>

Since then, Sera and the others have been alternating between the SS rank dungeon and the S rank dungeon daily, rapidly leveling up.

<b>

It seems that the experience points from the SS rank dungeon are better than expected, and they should soon be able to finish acquiring the status bonuses for their second jobs and derived second jobs. Once they reach that point, exploration will become considerably easier.

<b>

Goddess, Sword Saint, Saint, Spirit Archer—acquiring the bonuses at level 30 for these third jobs shouldn't be too much trouble, and it might even be fine to go that far, but since they are already experiencing death while exploring, they should be gaining quite a bit of combat experience.

<b>

Thanks to that, I've been getting spoiled by the three of them every night lately.

Siri has also gotten used to it and now hugs me normally, just like Sera and Phenon. And she’s sniffing my chest. She might be a scent fetishist.

<b>

However, while I am officially married to Sera and Phenon, it is not the case with Siri. We understand each other's feelings, so the word "still" comes into play.

<b>

In any case, since I'm spending the night with unmarried Siri, any nighttime activities are on hold.

<b>

"I've finished coordinating with the other countries, so it's up to you all when to go. Just make sure to let me know when you set off."

<b>

It seems that approval has been obtained from the five countries of Palmour, Rezel, Feima, Incen, and Niket, excluding Lindell. Well, it's not that we have bad relations with other countries, so it's more of a matter of their preparations than actual approval.

<b>

"Just so you know, we plan to head towards Palmour directionally, but there's a good chance that the direction before entering the dungeon and after entering won't match."

<b>

"I understand that as well."

<b>

In response to my words, Regulus nodded while organizing the documents.

<b>

"Originally, I was half in doubt, including myself. Just being told that the dungeon connects to another continent doesn't hold any credibility. The only reason it’s worth considering is that the speaker is from SR."

<b>

Regulus added that there was also the term "Lindell District" inside—no, no, that’s the main point. I would be troubled if my statement were taken that seriously.

<b>

"Well then, Crescent and I are all set, so I think we’ll give Sera and the others a day off and then set off the morning after tomorrow."

<b>

"Understood. Let me know once it's confirmed."

<b>

"Okay!"

<b>

After giving a half-hearted reply, I left the guild.

<b>

Next, I planned to go to the inn where Crescent and the others were staying (I had told them to stay put today and not go to the dungeon), and after that, I would be free. Sera and the others seem to be diving into the dungeon as usual... I guess I’ll head to the dungeon after all!

<b>

Since Sera and the others seemed to have lost (died) in the SS rank dungeon yesterday, they should be in the S rank dungeon today. I think I’ll enjoy a leisurely solo adventure in the dungeon for the first time in a while!

<b>

<b>

<b>

I advance through the SS rank dungeon, defeating monsters I come across. First, I plan to head towards the house I purchased, take a breather, and then explore. It’s sort of a preliminary inspection for guiding Sera and the others the day after tomorrow.

<b>

Upon entering the house, I found unfamiliar drinks and food in the refrigerator. There were also half-eaten items. Since only Crescent and Jade, besides me, should have access to this house, they must have brought these items in.

<b>

It seems they had sneakily gone into the dungeon together over the past week. They really love dungeons; I can’t say anything about that.

<b>

I grabbed a cup from the cupboard, poured some milk from a bottle into it, and gulped it down in one go. My throat was refreshed, I wasn’t hungry, and I was in perfect exploration mode.

<b>

Now, I wonder what the journey to Palmour will be like.

<b>

Outside the dungeon, the roads are mostly well-maintained, but I’ll have to navigate through mountain passes and bumpy roads. The total travel time is about five days.

<b>

Inside the dungeon, it’s mostly flatlands, but I can see mountains and forests in the distance.

<b>

However, since there are few of them, it doesn’t seem like the journey will be too difficult. It might just be that the parts I haven’t seen yet are steep.

<b>

"I hope a new boss appears. Since I’m at it, I’d like to earn a couple of coins too."

<b>

That house seems to have a limit of five people. There were five rooms as well.

Since the purchased house has me, Crescent, and Jade in it, all three of Sera, Phenon, and Siri cannot fit. Oh, and Noah too.

<b>

If that’s the case, it would be best to purchase another house.

One for the Earth group and one for ASR.

<b>

I’m not sure if ownership transfer or sale is possible, but if I can get one for ASR, I can give the other house to Crescent and the others.

<b>

"Collecting a large number of coins is something I’d like to do as a gamer."

<b>

Muttering such thoughts, I walked along the plains. After passing through the residential area from the dungeon entrance and going further in—after about two hours of walking through the path between the mountains I had seen in the distance, I defeated a boss monster along the way and earned a coin.

<b>

And then,

<b>

"…Oh no."

<b>

I easily discovered the entrance to another dungeon. I had intended it as a preliminary inspection, but I guess it was a mistake to charge ahead thinking, "I can return instantly from anywhere with emergency return." After all, I was looking for a boss. I wanted coins.

<b>

I had a hunch when I found another 7x7 residential area along the way, but… what kind of dungeon entrance is this connected to? I hope it’s not connected to Palmour or anything…
