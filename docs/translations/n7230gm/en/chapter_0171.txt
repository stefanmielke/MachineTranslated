# A-55 Unexpected M?

<b>

<b>

The攻略 of the B-rank dungeon was successfully completed without any notable incidents.

That said, this is just my perspective. For Phenon and Shiri, it must have been difficult to deal with an unfamiliar boss.

From the perspective of Niz-kun and the guards, I wasn't present for the boss battle, so the two princesses from another country and their maid, who had just been causing a commotion a moment ago, were easily accomplishing the 'B-rank dungeon conquest.'

<b>

While watching the boss battle, Niz-kun had been expressing his admiration, but by the time we exited the dungeon, he had become somewhat quieter. It seemed he needed time to process his thoughts.

<b>

So, after reuniting with Sera and the others outside the dungeon, we headed back to the royal capital. We were guided to the guest room of the royal castle at Niz-kun's suggestion, saying, "While we're at it, I'd like to treat you to some tea while we hear about Esuar-kun."

<b>

<b>

"Hehehe. This time, we won, didn't we?"

<b>

After quenching her thirst with tea, Sera proudly puffed out her chest.

As she said, this dungeon conquest was narrowly won by the Sera & Noah team. To be honest, our team wasn't really focused on competition, but when we exited the dungeon, Sera, looking exhausted, exclaimed, "We did it! We were the first! We won!" It was hard for me not to make a disappointed face. Noah, who was on the same team as her, was smiling wryly.

<b>

"That's right. As expected of Sera, I've come to respect you."

<b>

Sorry, Sera. I think you've grown, but this time, I can't really feel it. Because honestly, it felt more like, "Oh, we were competing, huh?" The members of our team seemed to quickly pick up on this atmosphere, and Niz-kun also said, "It seems I was the one who held us back, how unfortunate."

<b>

After praising Sera and Noah for a while, Niz-kun opened his mouth to get to the main topic.

<b>

"So, Esuar-kun. It seems you have a secret to share, but should we ask the others to leave?"

<b>

Niz-kun glanced at the guards stationed near the entrance of the room before speaking.

<b>

"Hmm... To be honest, I want to inform Lindale, who has helped me, first. So I didn't actually intend to disclose it here, but I think showing it will increase its credibility when this information circulates in the country."

<b>

If you don't want to believe it, you don't have to; you'll be the one losing out—yet at the same time, I find myself feeling irritated at the thought of being called a liar.

<b>

"If you're saying you can keep a secret, then that's fine."

<b>

"Right. Well, if you're feeling uneasy, I'll have them step back. I trust you, Esuar-kun, and whether the guards are here or not, if you were to start a rebellion, it would be our loss anyway."

<b>

"That's a bit extreme..."

<b>

As I said this, I imagined attacking the castle alone. I could probably win. Upon reconsideration, I realize I'm quite a dangerous element. Just like the other ASR members and the Thunder's Trajectory, there's a significant gap between me and the other citizens.

<b>

Indeed, I should announce the status bonuses as soon as possible.

<b>

We aren't thinking of anything criminal, but if someone with strange thoughts notices this fact and tries to monopolize the information, it could lead to serious trouble.

<b>

While Niz-kun was instructing the guards in the room to step back, Sera, sitting to my left, leaned in and whispered. It was a bit ticklish, and her face was close, making me blush.

<b>

(Are we going to talk about the bonuses?)

<b>

(No, I'll leave that to Lindale and the Thunder's Trajectory. I have the title of Overlord, so I don't need any more achievements... It's a hassle. For now, I'll just let Niz-kun see my list of professions.)

<b>

(Hehe, I wonder if he'll be so surprised that he faints.)

<b>

(—Ah, y-yeah.)

<b>

Don't laugh in my ear! It felt like someone blew air into my ear, and it gave me shivers!

As I tried to calm my racing heart without Sera noticing, Noah, sitting to my right, leaned in closer.

<b>

I wondered if Noah had something secret to say—thinking this, I leaned closer to her mouth.

<b>

(Haaahhhh)

<b>

Without saying anything, she simply blew warm breath into my ear.

<b>

"Ugh! What the hell, you little brat! What are you doing?!"

<b>

"Ahahaha! Big brother, are you weak in the ears?"

<b>

"Shut up! I've never been attacked like this before, so I don't know!"

<b>

I dropped a hand chop on Noah, who was laughing heartily, and she cried out, "That hurts!" I sighed in exasperation.

<b>

"Hey, Noah! Can we switch seats, please?!"

<b>

"No way! What are you planning, Phenon? I only have a bad feeling about this!"

<b>

"Actually, I have a secret to discuss with Esuar-san..."

<b>

"That can't be right, can it?! You just want to blow into my ear, right?!"

<b>

If Phenon did something like that—if that were to happen... Huh? Could this be a reward? No, at least in terms of time and place, this is inappropriate!

Since Niz-kun was grinning while watching, I would prefer if they at least waited until we got home.

<b>

Shiri was looking at us with a somewhat envious expression, and I wondered if she also had a sadistic side. She wouldn't be thinking about attacking my ears, would she? Surely it must be something else—though I can't think of anything, it must be something else, right?

<b>

"Should I join in too—should I blow some air?"

<b>

"Hey, you dumb prince over there! Don't get involved! So don't even think about standing up!"

<b>

I accidentally spoke disrespectfully to a member of the royal family, but Niz-kun didn't seem to mind at all and was laughing very happily and joyfully.

<b>

Happy to be yelled at... really? Could it be that this guy is—
