# A-73 Second in the World

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next morning.

<b>

It's the second day of our new home life, but there still seem to be places we haven't explored, so we decided to explore the house and the garden. Since we focused on the inside of the house yesterday, we want to check out the outside today.

<b>

While we were still sleeping or relaxing in our rooms, the Shiri family, who had been taking care of the party house, and the security team led by Ray came to our new home.

<b>

In Ray's case, it seems he has started diving into dungeons frequently since resigning from the knight order, so this location, close to B-rank and A-rank dungeons, might be convenient for him as well.

<b>

That aside.

<b>

After gathering in the dining room for breakfast, everyone went off to do their own thing—namely, exploring the house and garden. For now, we decided to call out to someone if we were going outside, and including the servants, we continued to look around the house.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Phew... I can't believe this is my house."

<b>

I think again that it's too big. Are there such mansions in Japan...? There must be some somewhere that I just don't know about.

<b>

After chatting with party members and servants we occasionally passed by, we spent almost two hours exploring the house and garden. By now, there surely can't be any more places to see, so I took a break in the gazebo with a pure white roof in the garden.

<b>

"Considering the income from SR, it wouldn't be strange if this house were ten times bigger."

<b>

Since we can take as many elixirs as we want. No wonder we become rich.

<b>

Sitting across from me at a table that looked like it was made of white marble was Sera. On the table were two teacups filled with tea. Sera and I were resting when Aine, Shiri's older sister, prepared them for us. Quick work.

<b>

"If it's too big, it would just be a burden... Nobility is troublesome."

<b>

While my parents probably want to live in a more luxurious house than a shabby one.

For Fenon, who originally lived in the royal castle, this is undoubtedly a downgrade. If I were in my parents' position, I might feel a bit uncomfortable about it.

<b>

"Hehe, SR will surely get used to it soon."

<b>

Sera said with a chuckle, elegantly sipping her tea before speaking again.

<b>

"By the way, when are you planning to go to the next country? Are you going to conquer all the S-rank dungeons?"

<b>

"Ah, yeah. That's the plan, but as I mentioned before, I'm going to take it easy in Lindell for a while. If I were to go next... I think Rezel would be good for now. I don't have any acquaintances in other countries."

<b>

If I'm lucky, I might be able to make connections with people from other countries when I go to Rezel. I wonder if the Vinzett siblings will introduce me to someone.

<b>

Sera nodded at my words and said, "I want to level up by then." She seemed to be tightening her fists with determination.

<b>

"Of course, I'm motivated, and Fenon and Shiri are too. We lost to Neska and the others in the Palmour Kingdom."

<b>

Ah... now that I think about it, we did lose.

But that was because they had five people while we only had Sera, Fenon, and Shiri. I don't think it's something to worry about that much. Besides, we won in matches with the same number of participants.

<b>

I tried to convey that gently, but Sera closed her eyelids and shook her head.

<b>

"We had the advantage in status. And despite living with a master like SR by our side, losing is disappointing."

<b>

"I'm not good at teaching, and they have been explorers for a longer time, after all."

<b>

Besides, we are a count's daughter, a princess, and a maid. By the way, the remaining members are a former god and a person from another world. Listing them out, we are quite a rare group.

<b>

"Well, I think we'll probably take it easy here for at least six months, so while leveling up in the dungeon, we can also train in combat against other people occasionally. I'll join in, and we have the Lightning Trail here too."

<b>

Moreover, my brother Ray is nearby. I can learn from him as well. He seems to be better at combat than Shin. I don't know if he's good at teaching, though.

<b>

"I might still be clumsy with my body, but I have the knowledge. I've seen many battles from the people in your world, big brother."

<b>

"…Don't suddenly appear and join the conversation, Noah."

<b>

Letting out a sigh and turning around, I saw Noah leaning on the fence surrounding the gazebo. She said in a playful tone, "Eh, I just walked over normally!" What a lie, she definitely snuck up on us.

<b>

"If you've been taught by the pinnacle of the world and a god, then at least you should become the second strongest in the world. Hahaha..."

<b>

Sera let out a dry laugh and murmured something like that.

<b>

Even without putting so much pressure on herself, I already think Sera is the second strongest in the world.
