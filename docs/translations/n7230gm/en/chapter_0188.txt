# A-71 Jumping in the New House

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Our house is built on a small hill, a little away from the crowded city――located exactly between an A-rank dungeon and a B-rank dungeon.

<b>

It is a wooden structure similar to the one before the renovation, and the arching terrace has been retained, so there is some resemblance, but the size and shape have changed significantly.

<b>

<b>

First, the shape of the building; previously, it appeared rectangular from above, but the renovated house is square. It has evolved from a two-story to a three-story building, and the center of the house has an atrium that extends from the first to the third floor. This was my wish.

<b>

Considering the number of rooms and the presence of others, I decided on a three-story construction, but it seems that my room as the owner must be on the top floor.

That means when I come home and say, "Ah, I'm tired," I have to trudge up the stairs to the third floor. That’s not ideal.

<b>

Then I had a flash of inspiration. If walking is a hassle, why not jump――?

<b>

The floor on the first level is made of thick wood to prevent it from breaking, so there’s no worry about crashing through the floor when jumping down from the third floor. The railing around the atrium on the third floor is also built sturdy enough that it won’t budge even if someone stands on it.

<b>

"It seems like a lifestyle that might have a negative impact on Phenon."

<b>

"I... hadn't thought about that."

<b>

When I excitedly explained, "If I jump from here, I'll be in the bedroom in no time," Sera gave a wry smile.

Having received a full explanation from the contractors who were present, they have since gone home, and currently, ASR and the Lightning Trail――and a few guards are in the garden.

<b>

"Do you think I can jump that high...?"

<b>

"......Let's not have Phenon do it. If she happens to get injured, I wouldn't have a face to show the king."

<b>

"You can carry me if you want?"

<b>

Ah... a princess carry, huh? In Phenon's case, it’s complicated because she really is a princess.

But indeed, if I were to carry her, it wouldn’t be a problem even in the worst-case scenario as I would be the one underneath, and I have no intention of making such a blunder. It’s safe, so to speak.

<b>

As I was thinking that way, I felt a tug on the hem of my clothes from behind. When I turned around, Noah was grinning.

<b>

"Then I’m a princess too――" "You jump." "Can’t you at least let me finish my sentence!?"

<b>

That was quite a quick retort. Noah has really improved.

It’s hard to believe he was originally a god who said, "I want you to save the world." Well, Noah has had a tough time, and he might just be joking around due to various repercussions.

<b>

"Normally, there would be some security concerns, but I doubt anyone in this country would try to attack this house."

<b>

Sera smiled as she watched me and Noah play around, saying that.

For now, I plan to move the staff (the Sera family) and guards currently in the royal capital to this house. I have prepared rooms for them, and it seems Phenon will arrange for new staff at the party house in the royal capital.

<b>

Just the fact that a knight named Ray, who is among the strongest, is providing security should significantly lower the risk of an attack. After all, the crime rate in this world is low.

<b>

"Hey, SR. Can I try it too?"

<b>

Shin looked up, his eyes sparkling like a boy who found a stag beetle.

But I won’t let him. I’m the main one here. I went up the stairs when I was shown around earlier.

<b>

"Here I go!"

<b>

Before I could respond to Shin, I jumped up to the third floor.

I don’t often jump in the city, but it’s not unheard of when fighting giant enemies. I landed cleanly on the railing of the third floor and quietly descended to the inner floor. Yeah, no problem.

<b>

"Nice! If you break anything, you’ll have to pay for it!"

<b>

"I won’t do that."

<b>

Shin said that with a smirk and then bent down, jumping over without hesitation. However, it seemed he didn’t quite have enough height, and he muttered, "Oh no," but he placed his hands on the top of the railing and lifted himself up, landing next to me in a spinning motion.

<b>

"......Somehow, that looks cooler than mine."

<b>

"Is that so? You look more graceful."

<b>

That might be true, but... it’s kind of frustrating. It feels like I won in the main game but lost in a mini-game.

<b>

Should I go down again and try to jump up like Shin did――as I was thinking that, Sera suddenly appeared from the atrium.

<b>

It seems she jumped from the first floor like us, but unlike Shin, she overshot and was flailing in the air. Fortunately, the ceiling is reasonably high, so she didn’t hit it――

<b>

"Clear the way!"

<b>

The apex of her parabolic trajectory seems to be right where I’m currently standing. What is she doing? What about the negative impact on Phenon?

<b>

As I quickly stepped aside, Sera landed quietly in the spot. Her ears and cheeks were flushed.

<b>

"I-I wasn’t thinking that I wanted to join in because you two were having so much fun! This is training for emergencies!"

<b>

If I hadn’t said anything, I wouldn’t have thought that... I guess it’s true that the tongue is a source of disaster.
