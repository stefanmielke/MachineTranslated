# A-5 The Inheritance of the Overlord

<b>

<b>

<b>

Overlord.

<b>

In the VRMMO Tempest, this class was referred to as the elusive fourth-tier job.

Although the game operators hinted at its existence, no one was able to meet the requirements due to the extreme difficulty, leading to doubts about whether such a class truly existed.

<b>

The conditions for job change were to max out all classes and solo defeat the boss of the SS-rank dungeon—Overlord Venom. While it was simple, just leveling up took a considerable amount of time, so only hardcore players aimed for it.

<b>

Looking back now, this condition was likely set up by Noah to force someone to defeat the God of Destruction Venom, and it wouldn’t be surprising if the Overlord class was actually fictional. As long as they could draw someone who met the conditions here, they could end Tempest's service without issue.

<b>

However, the Overlord did indeed exist.

The twist is that it was not implemented in the game world, but in another world.

<b>

"Wouldn't it have been fine to just have all A's? There's a huge gap compared to other classes."

<b>

"Well, this is already a save, you know? Plus, doesn’t it feel like 'Overlord!' because it’s so overwhelming? If it turned out to be not that strong after all that effort, it would be a letdown."

<b>

In the deep night of the day of the ceremony.

Noah and I had booked a two-person room at an inn and were discussing the Overlord class.

<b>

The three who reluctantly attended the ceremony spent the night at their respective homes and were set to join us tomorrow. Apparently, there would be a parade tomorrow with the Thunderbolt's trail, featuring a ridiculously large and extravagantly luxurious carriage, so we decided to go see it together. Well, the main purpose was the food stalls, though.

<b>

"That’s definitely a letdown... but isn’t the job change condition for others to defeat me? If they have to defeat me now that I’ve taken this class, it’s probably tougher than soloing Venom, right?"

<b>

There might be some compatibility issues, but simply put, I, who can defeat Venom alone, am now even stronger. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but at least for now, it would be difficult.

<b>

Unlike in the game, I had not maxed out all classes, but I had become eligible to change to the Overlord class.

<b>

However, even if I hadn’t mastered all my current skills, I thought I could easily defeat Venom if I challenged him as an Overlord.

I wished I could have been this class when defeating Venom, but it seemed impossible as long as he existed in this world. There was also something about the capacity of the soul, but I didn’t quite understand that.

<b>

"It probably won’t work unless big brother’s body becomes frail."

<b>

"Hahaha... It’s starting to feel like a family inheritance of classes."

<b>

The Overlord has no levels. When you change jobs, the level display in the status disappears.

Stats like STR are all S rank, and although they are slightly lower compared to other third-tier jobs at max level, they can be compensated with equipment, and the ability to use skills from all classes is such an advantage that a slight drop in stats doesn’t matter.

<b>

As I absentmindedly considered scenarios where I might lose, Noah suddenly clapped her palm with her fist as if she had come up with something. "That’s it!" Her words came out a moment later.

<b>

"Why not let your children inherit it? We can decide the successor among the four kids: Sera, Fenon, and my children with Shiri."

<b>

"...Huh? The first two are one thing, but you and Shiri—"

<b>

"Ah... but I wouldn’t want to see my own kids fighting, right? There’s only one Overlord class. More importantly, do you think anyone other than big brother will be born with a soul capable of enduring that class?"

<b>

"Don’t tilt your head innocently like that. Why are you and Shiri supposed to have my children?"

<b>

"But I think Lady Idea will adjust that part. She’s probably listening to our conversation right now, and she can do just about anything."

<b>

"Listen to me, you idiot! Don’t immerse yourself in your own world!"

<b>

"Children, huh... I’ve created many as a god, but I guess I’d feel a lot of affection if life were to be born from my own body. But I’m not the administrator of this world right now, so it shouldn’t be a problem if the love is biased—oh, I need to think of names! I have to consider both for a boy and a girl."

<b>

Muttering away.

Completely ignoring my words, Noah was lost in her own thoughts. I tried to get her attention, but she ignored me.

<b>

Is this really how you are? You’ve never been this openly expressive before, have you?

I had an image of her thinking about things I couldn’t even imagine.

<b>

"…I don’t really care anymore."

<b>

Even if I were to shake her eardrums now, it probably wouldn’t reach her crucial brain.

I decided to lie down on the bed I was sitting on, closed my eyelids, and just gave vague responses.

<b>

"I said four children earlier, but thinking about it, there’s a possibility of having more than two, right?"

<b>

"Yeah, that’s true."

<b>

"I’d want at least two... I don’t know about Sera and the others, though."

<b>

"That’s right."

<b>

"I think having just one child would be lonely. You understand how I feel, right? Since both you and I often had just one."

<b>

"Uh-huh."

<b>

As I gave monotonous replies, my consciousness gradually began to blur.

I could tell Noah was speaking, but I couldn’t understand the meaning anymore.

<b>

After about thirty minutes, Noah finally turned off the room light and crawled into her bed.

However, her talk continued.

<b>

"Will our children become explorers too? I think they’d admire their dad if they grew up watching him, but I don’t want them to do anything too dangerous."

<b>

"U... yeah... that’s right."

<b>

"They’ll probably become amazing explorers... because they have great bloodlines. Well, it’s clear that just having dad’s blood will make them incredible explorers."

<b>

"Yeah."

<b>

Oh no, I’m about to lose consciousness.

I feel bad for Noah, who is happily chatting, but it wouldn’t be surprising if I couldn’t respond at any moment.

<b>

"By the way..."

<b>

"...Yeah?"

<b>

"You will marry me, right?"

<b>

"...Yeah."

<b>

As I managed to respond, I thought I faintly heard a "fufufu" laugh.

<b>

"I’ve made sure to get your word on that. Lady Idea is probably watching too, so I’ll have her as a witness if it comes to that. ...Phew, I’m tired from this unfamiliar talk. Now I can finally sleep... I think I’ll have sweet dreams."

<b>

As she said something at the end, I finally couldn’t respond and fell into a deep sleep.

<b>

And that day, for some reason, I dreamt of being granted the skill "Child of Fortune" by the loli goddess.
