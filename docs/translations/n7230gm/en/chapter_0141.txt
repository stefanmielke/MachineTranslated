# A-27 Cheerful and Excited

<b>

<b>

<b>

Since arriving in Renas, the mood of the women has been exceptionally good.

<b>

And to be precise, it seems to have started while we were on our way to Renas, because they could see a future of living together with me—at least, I think so, but since I haven't confirmed it with anyone, it may not be the truth. It would be very embarrassing if it were a misunderstanding.

<b>

However, among the party members, only Noah, who usually spends time with me, is acting normally, occasionally muttering meaningfully, "Big brother is a lucky guy." What's wrong with being happy?

<b>

The new house in the royal capital will be completed in two months.

<b>

About a month has passed since the building order was placed, but the cheerful atmosphere of Sera and the others seems to be clearly conveyed to those around us, as even the dungeon receptionists and guild members ask, "Did something good happen?" As a side note, Sera tripped while skipping around town.

<b>

Among the explorers who are fans of them, there are some sharp ones asking, "Is it a guy? Did she get a boyfriend?" But when they learn the truth, I will surely be in the royal capital. At most, let them fill Renas with blood tears.

<b>

"I don't think there will be any problems as long as I haven't caused any major issues and have proper achievements; I believe His Majesty will recognize me."

<b>

For example, clearing an S-rank dungeon.

<b>

If there is a concern, it is that in the world before the collapse, I was considered a hero who saved Fenon’s life. Therefore, both His Majesty Xeno and Prime Minister Dino were favorable towards my marriage with Fenon, but I wonder how it will be this time.

If it comes to it, there is also the option of a power push strategy by Fenon, Sera, and the others from the Trails of Thunder, but I would prefer to have it recognized by my own strength. After all, I am still a man.

<b>

"It seems like you're worried about various things, but King Xeno already recognizes you to some extent."

<b>

Noah, sitting across the table, says in an exasperated tone.

In about thirty minutes, the other members will arrive at our home away from Renas, but for now, it's just Noah and me.

Spending everyday life with this guy has somehow become a normal scene.

<b>

"First of all, they would thoroughly investigate the party members of the first princess—her important daughter. I didn't mention it because it didn't seem harmful, but many of the people we interact with, like the knights on guard and the dungeon receptionists, are connected to the royal family."

<b>

"Eh... why didn't you tell me that?"

<b>

"Because it's a good thing for Sera and Fenon. It seems they don't think poorly of it, so Xeno must have judged that there are 'no issues with your character.' During the audience, he seemed to pay special attention to you."

<b>

"If they don't think poorly of me, that's good... so then, it's just a matter of having achievements that satisfy those around me."

<b>

"That's right."

<b>

Noah says this and takes a sip of her tea, then continues, "But—"

<b>

"It might be that just clearing an S-rank dungeon won't be enough. In the previous world, that might have been sufficient, but now there are many who have cleared B-rank dungeons, and the Trails of Thunder have already cleared A-rank."

<b>

Ah... that's certainly true.

I think the possibility is low, but it seems the probability of not being recognized is not zero.

<b>

Then, does that mean I need to reach a realm that no one can attain—specifically, do I need to fight Venom again? I was thinking I would like to fight again in the state of the Overlord, so I don't mind.

<b>

"I don't know about that. I can't say for sure—ah, when I say I don't know, I mean regarding being recognized, not about the SS-rank dungeon."

<b>

"Huh? Isn't it like a game where an Overlord's castle is created?"

<b>

I had thought that was the case.

<b>

"Well... it's not up to me to decide; it's up to Lady Idea, who currently manages this world. After all, the Overlord's castle that appeared in Tempest was merely a game element, and in reality, it was just sealed away. There was originally no castle, so if there is a continuation of the S-rank dungeon, it would need to be created from scratch."

<b>

"...Seriously? So the worst-case scenario is that it ends with S-rank—there's a possibility of that?"

<b>

"That's a possibility. But knowing Lady Idea, I believe she will properly prepare a substitute. Moreover, as we've discussed many times, her power is on a different level. She can do outrageous things, so it might lead to the creation of a new dungeon that we can't even imagine."

<b>

"Oh... I hadn't considered that pattern."

<b>

I can't help but get really excited.

Could a new wind blow through Tempest, which seemed to have reached its end?

Will there be strong enemies prepared that even I, as the Overlord, would struggle against?

<b>

"I'm sorry to interrupt your excitement, but it's not set in stone, okay? Don't get your hopes up too much."

<b>

"I'm fine. I'm calm."

<b>

"Haha... I want you to say that after looking in the mirror."

<b>

<b>

A few days later, in the town of Renas, explorers and townspeople were talking about how "the four other members besides Noah are grinning excessively and it's creepy"—this was brought up by Noah.

<b>

Each of us, aware of the situation, deeply bowed our heads to the youngest-looking girl.

<b>

We sincerely apologized—"I'm very sorry."
