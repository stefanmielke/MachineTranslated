# A-12 Su・San!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Shin-samaaaaaaa! Please look this wayyyyyyy!"

<b>

"I knew you guys would do it!"

<b>

"Long live the Thunderbolt's Trail!!"

<b>

As the carriage carrying Shin and the others approached, the murky noise of the city transformed into clear words of praise. I wonder what it feels like to be praised for hours on end. I would probably get quite fed up with it.

<b>

"Do you think they'll notice us?"

<b>

Phenon, sitting to my right, asked while watching the approaching carriage. The way she innocently looked up at me like a puppy seeking its master felt more fitting for a high school girl than a princess.

<b>

"If we shout loud enough, it might reach their ears—though you're leaning out too much, Phenon. It's dangerous, so back up a bit."

<b>

Just in case, I placed my hand on her slender shoulder, which had little flesh on it.

I was trying to act naturally, but since opportunities to touch a girl's body are rare, I was quite nervous inside. If you peek into my heart right now, Noah, I would knock you out.

<b>

"Hehe, it's fine because Esuar-san is here."

<b>

Saying that, Phenon launched an attack on me with a smile from close range, like a bullet.

Even though I've been spending more time with women, the mental age of a man nearing forty still hasn't built up any resistance and got knocked out in one hit—though that's just a joke.

<b>

I'm not the only one worried about Phenon falling.

Sera was glancing at us from the opposite side, and Shiri was lightly tugging at the hem of Phenon's clothes right behind her. The person in question seemed unaware of it, though.

The maid, concerned for her master, sent me an eye contact that said, "I'm being careful too." I responded with a "Thank you" through my gaze.

<b>

After a few minutes of watching the parade, rather than the parade itself, but the residents crowding around it.

As we got close enough to distinguish the smiling faces of Shin and the others on the carriage, Sera opened her mouth.

<b>

"It seems like there's no time to talk after all."

<b>

"Yeah. Trying to meet on the day of the parade was probably a mistake. The city should calm down in a few days, so for today, we should just let Shin know we're here."

<b>

"Even if we don't try to make contact, there's a chance they'll come looking for us from the Thunderbolt's Trail."

<b>

"That's right. So let's enjoy the festival today. And then we can tease Shin and the others."

<b>

"...You have a face like a mischievous boy, Esuar."

<b>

"It's just your imagination."

<b>

I'm not plotting anything.

It's just a bit embarrassing to sincerely offer words of praise.

<b>

Whether this is a trait of the Japanese temperament or just my personal disposition is uncertain.

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

Not long ago, Noah had said it might get interesting.

<b>

I came to understand the meaning of those words with my eyes wide open.

<b>

"Hahhhaaaaaaa! I've been waiting for you, Thunderbolt's Trail!"

<b>

When the carriage carrying Shin and the others got closest to the guild, a blue-haired man with a slightly foolish-looking face, leaning out of the window of the adjacent room, shouted at a volume that blew away the surrounding noise. The crowd's gaze turned towards us all at once.

<b>

I had sensed someone was in the adjacent room.

I knew there was one person and that they bore no ill will.

<b>

So I never imagined they would engage with Shin and the others like this.

<b>

The clothes he wore were quite high quality.

At the very least, he could be a noble—or possibly even royalty, but judging by Phenon and Sera's stunned expressions, he didn't seem to be someone they recognized.

<b>

Who is this person?

<b>

"The strongest man of the Rezel Kingdom! Arnold Vinzett, making a grand entrance!"

<b>

The man—Arnold, introduced himself as if answering my question, and with a shout of "Hoo!" he jumped out from the adjacent room into the street.

That action, which would be suicidal on Earth, is not something to worry about in this world—not that it's a common occurrence, but at least it wouldn't lead to serious injury.

<b>

He introduced himself as the strongest man of the Rezel Kingdom, so his status must be high.

<b>

"Ah."

<b>

That short exclamation came from either Phenon, Sera, Shiri, Noah, or perhaps I unconsciously uttered it myself.

<b>

Arnold's cloak got caught on the window frame as he tried to jump out.

<b>

A ripping sound of high-quality fabric echoed, followed by a cry of "Nnngh!" from the strongest man of the Rezel Kingdom—more like a whimper.

<b>

Due to the rebellion of his feet left behind in the room, Arnold ended up not showcasing a graceful leap but instead performed a self-destructive act that would make any performer blush, falling headfirst towards the ground while attracting the crowd's attention.

<b>

However, as expected of someone who calls himself the strongest man of the Rezel Kingdom.

<b>

I heard a determined shout of "Hmph!" and he managed to roll and land perfectly. He quickly stood up, brushing off the dust from his clothes.

<b>

The citizens who had been cheering just moments ago began to murmur quietly like students before a school assembly.

<b>

"...Could he be an opponent we fought in the International Martial Arts Tournament?"

<b>

Sera muttered as if asking herself. I was thinking the same thing, so I replied, "Probably."

<b>

The Rezel Kingdom is a major power, second only to the Lindell Kingdom.

I hadn't heard the name Vinzett in the game, but commoners in this world don't have family names, so he must be a noble. And since his name doesn't include Rezel, he isn't royalty.

<b>

While I was absentmindedly pondering this, Arnold seemed to have started an argument with the knights guarding the carriage. Shin and the others were watching the scene with exasperation.

<b>

"Shall we go? The knights might find it difficult to deal with nobles from other countries."

<b>

Phenon seemed to have judged him to be a noble from Arnold's remarks and suggested that to me.

<b>

"Ah... well, that's true."

<b>

I couldn't hear what they were discussing, but if he was throwing a tantrum, we would need to intervene to keep the parade going.

No matter how much of a noble he is, if Sera, who holds a title, and Phenon, the first princess, speak to him, he would have no choice but to comply.

<b>

If he were to resort to violence, then at that time—right?
