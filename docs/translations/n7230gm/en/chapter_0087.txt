# 84 The Battle Maniac Desires Loneliness

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

A day passed, then three days, and before I knew it, a week had gone by since the S-rank dungeon appeared.

<b>

The only thing I can do to fix this broken world is to believe in the mysterious voice and defeat Venom, yet I still can't bring myself to leave the house.

<b>

There have been many visitors to my home.

<b>

From royal family members to guild representatives, and even explorers I’ve never heard of claiming to be friends.

The fact that I don’t know their names suggests they are people patched in to keep the gears of this broken world turning. I don’t care.

<b>

"I guess people think I'm the one who's gone crazy."

<b>

I roll over in bed and mutter in a hoarse voice.

<b>

Of course they do.

Only I am saying something different. It’s only natural for them to think I’ve lost my mind.

<b>

"Is it wrong to be scared…?"

<b>

I defend my reclusive self with my own words.

<b>

I’m afraid of meeting people.

<b>

I’m scared that the friends and acquaintances I’ve interacted with have had their memories altered. Those people are no longer the ones I knew.

<b>

I’m afraid to go outside.

<b>

The scenery that used to be so normal, the people who were always there, have vanished, and that terrifies me.

I can’t even tell when or where something will disappear, yet I somehow manage to keep my sanity.

<b>

I’m afraid of fighting Venom.

<b>

While I sleep, I’ve imagined fighting Venom countless times in my head.

I hope the enemy continues to move in the predetermined patterns of the game, but the monsters in this world have slight differences in their movements compared to the game.

In the battle against Venom, those "slight differences" are more than enough to lead me to death.

Once I die, not even an elixir will help. It’s game over.

<b>

Maybe I should just wait in this house until everything disappears.

I don’t know if I would disappear with it, but if it means I don’t have to think about anything, that might be okay―― I even consider that.

<b>

"If it was going to turn out like this…"

<b>

It would have been better if I had never been reborn into this VR world. If I have to lose my memories with Sera, Phenon, and Shiri, I would have preferred not to have them at all.

If I could return to my original world, I wish I could go back right now――

<b>

<b>

<b>

But,

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I wouldn't think that, right?"

<b>

I chuckle wryly, wave my hand dramatically, and then get up from the bed. Perhaps because I’ve been lying down for so long, I feel dizzy. I slap my cheeks and gather my resolve.

<b>

"I’m not joking. I don’t care if it’s the game’s operators, a god, or a devil; they’re not going to take my memories away. Don’t mess with me!"

<b>

I don’t want to erase my time spent in this world.

The days I spent with everyone, I will definitely reclaim. Even if all of humanity living in this world doesn’t believe my words, even if everyone disappears, even if they lose their memories, even if they forget me, I will bring it all back.

<b>

"Bring it on, you little brat."

<b>

Living in a world like this is as good as being dead anyway―― so if I have to fight Venom and die, the only thing I’ll lose is my life. I have no choice but to challenge it. And I have to win.

There was never a choice to begin with.

<b>

"Whether it’s Venom or a god, if they’re going to destroy my daily life, I’ll chop them into pieces and kill them."

<b>

I once defeated Venom and reigned at the pinnacle of Tempest.

<b>

Suzume said I was a "battle maniac," but maybe she wasn’t entirely wrong. Though I don’t like it.

In the real world, I was quite ordinary; the only thing I could be proud of was my ability to defeat monsters.

<b>

<b>

Then, as you wish, I’ll go crazy.

<b>

I’ll start my days filled with battle once again.

<b>

To defeat Venom, to reclaim the world, I’ll rampage to my heart's content.

<b>

<b>

"Haha, it seems like my 'eyes' are in better shape than usual today. Maybe it’s because I slept well?"

<b>

I’m in perfect condition to dive into the dungeon.

I can see better than usual.

<b>

I take a deep breath and open the door to my room.

Time waits for no one; I’ll head to the A-rank dungeon and quickly achieve fifty clears. Then I’ll change to a third job and tackle the S-rank dungeon.

It’s past 5 PM, so I should be able to do two runs, right? No, I might as well ignore the rules of this world and keep diving endlessly.

<b>

Thinking about such things, I headed toward the place where Sera might be.

<b>

<b>

As I approached the living room, I saw Sera standing up from the sofa, her face showing surprise.

It’s been a while since we’ve faced each other like this. I had been avoiding talking to her and only went to the bathroom or ate when she was asleep.

<b>

"Sera, do you know who I am?"

<b>

I know that losing memories happens when a person disappears from this world, but I ask to confirm.

If she were to say, "Who the hell are you!?" I would definitely feel down.

<b>

"Of course I know!"

<b>

With a face that looks like she might cry, Sera replies.

I can’t tell what emotions are swirling within her. If someone she lived with suddenly said such a thing, it would probably make her feel sad.

<b>

However, I have no intention of asking or talking about unnecessary things. No matter what she says, my course of action won’t change.

<b>

"I’m going to buy food for Reinas now. After that, I plan to stay in the A-rank dungeon. I probably won’t come back to this house until it’s time to sleep――"

<b>

"I’ll go with you!"

<b>

With a desperate expression, she says this. But I shake my head and refuse her offer.

<b>

"Why not!? We’ve always gone together until now!"

<b>

Like a child throwing a tantrum, she’s on the verge of tears.

<b>

No, Sera.

It wasn’t just the two of us; we’ve always been a party of four. I’m the one who wants to cry.

<b>

I walk up close to the excited Sera, place my hands on her shoulders from behind, and force her to sit back down on the sofa. Then, I gently place my hand on her head.

<b>

"You might not believe me, but I’ll tell you. I want to explain to you what the situation in this world looks like from my perspective."

<b>

I have a friend I would risk my life to save――

<b>

And about Shiri, and Regulus.

That the world is currently in the midst of breaking apart.

And that only I can perceive it.

<b>

I took about ten minutes to slowly explain.

<b>

"If you were to disappear right in front of me, I would definitely be extremely shaken. That would be quite dangerous during a battle. So please let me go alone. I want to save Sera’s friends…… my precious people."

<b>

"………………"

<b>

"……Well then, I’m off."

<b>

After lightly patting Sera’s head one last time, I left the house. In the end, she didn’t turn back to look at me or respond.

I think she’s probably confused because my story is too absurd. If the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t easily believe it either, so it can’t be helped.

<b>

I didn’t talk to make her believe me.

I had hoped she might―― but I didn’t expect that much.

I just thought it would be better to tell the truth than to lie and persuade her. That’s why I did it.

<b>

This might be the last time I see Sera. I might never talk to her again. That possibility is very real.

<b>

I closed my eyes, imprinting the image of Sera hunched over in my mind, and headed alone toward the city of Reinas.

In my inventory, the ring and necklace I lost the chance to give her, along with a bouquet of flowers, quietly lay in wait. I hope one day I can give them to the three of them.

<b>

A single tear flowed from the corner of my eye, carried away by the wind.
