# 53 The One Who Possesses Both Strength and Softness

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I wish I could just hide in a hole..."

<b>

To escape the gazes around me, I hugged my knees and buried my head in them.

I hoped it was just a bad dream, but with Shin laughing heartily and patting my back, I realized without even pinching my cheeks that it was reality. It hurts, you idiot.

<b>

When Sera faced Ray on stage, I could tell from a distance that she was unsettled.

Perhaps because I had been watching her closely, the difference from her usual self was glaringly obvious. Whether the other spectators noticed her change is uncertain.

<b>

"Cheer up! You looked cool out there――heh heh."

<b>

Just when I thought he finally stopped laughing loudly, he started chuckling softly instead. It only made me angrier!

<b>

"Don't laugh! I never thought my voice would carry that far!"

<b>

"Esuar, you were the center of attention――heh."

<b>

"I haven't laughed that hard in a long time."

<b>

"Seriously, you think it's someone else's business...?"

<b>

I had become a complete laughingstock.

If someone else were in the same situation, I might have laughed too, but that's a different story. I will definitely get my revenge someday.

<b>

Grumbling under my breath, I directed my gaze to the center of the arena.

<b>

There stood Sera, looking completely different from earlier. Her previously slightly hunched posture was now upright and confident.

If that was the effect of my shout, then my embarrassment was not in vain. I sincerely hope that's the case.

<b>

In the center, Regulus was speaking as the referee. He was likely confirming the rules for determining the winner and any fouls.

<b>

Once Sera and Ray nodded, Regulus stepped back a few paces and shouted loudly enough for the audience to hear, "Begin!"

<b>

In that instant.

<b>

The two clashed head-on, swords colliding. It became a tense standoff, each pushing against the other.

It seemed the blades were dulled to prevent cutting, but since they weren't wooden swords, a considerable impact must have been transmitted to their hands. Just because there were no sharp edges didn't mean the damage was zero.

<b>

This match was not for showcasing the new job that had just been revealed; it was a stage to demonstrate the strength of B-rank dungeon conquerors.

<b>

If I trust the information from Shin, Ray was entering the match as an 80-level swordsman. If he were to fight seriously, he would likely choose a fully trained job over a low-level secondary class.

<b>

And Sera was the same.

Her job was also that of a swordsman at the highest level.

<b>

If I remember correctly, her level was around 65?

<b>

Looking only at levels, she was inferior to her brother. However――,

<b>

"Hey, hey... Sera is pushing him back with strength. What an amazing sight."

<b>

Having gained numerous player bonuses, she surpassed her brother, who had only trained as a swordsman. Ray's STR is C, but Sera's is B.

<b>

Sera, who is shorter and lighter than her brother, pushing back his sword with sheer strength is indeed a sight that is rare, as Shin said.

<b>

Ray showed a moment of surprise in the face of Sera's strength, but quickly regained his stance and distanced himself.

Sera likely intended it as a test of strength――without pursuing, she calmly restructured her sword stance.

<b>

In response to Sera's waiting posture, Ray immediately raised his sword and charged with a loud, "Wooooooh!"

<b>

Sera responded to the sword swung diagonally downward with a seemingly effortless sword technique. It wasn't that she lacked motivation; there was simply no waste.

She slightly diverted the sword's trajectory, causing Ray's blade to strike the cobblestones instead of hitting her.

<b>

With a flowing motion, she stepped on the sword that had been brought down to the ground, restricting her brother's movement, and before he could think of his next move, she had her sword at his neck――only to retreat again, resuming her stance.

<b>

The spectators in the arena began to murmur in confusion at her inexplicable actions.

<b>

What is she doing? That should have settled the match, right?

<b>

Not just me, but Shin and the others watching the match must also be filled with questions. Surely, everyone in the venue is wondering, "Why?"

<b>

The previous exchange, in stark contrast to the initial clash, was a beautiful movement that captivated the audience, like a butterfly dancing――like a princess in a story performing a dance.

<b>

It was truly a fleeting moment.

<b>

While I thought it was indeed unsatisfying that the match ended so abruptly, what could her intention be?

<b>

"Sera, what are you doing?"

<b>

"I don't know――but that movement seems to connect to Esuar."

<b>

"I thought the same... By the way, do you understand the meaning behind her actions, Esuar?"

<b>

"No... I haven't heard anything from her."

<b>

It was a chance to finally defeat her brother, who she had never been able to beat, so why on earth?

<b>

As I tilted my head and glanced toward the royal box, I caught the eye of Fenon, dressed in a pure white dress, a stark contrast to her usual demeanor.

Seeing her elegant and refined appearance made me question if she was truly the same person who was so lively while diving into dungeons.

<b>

She smiled at me, forming a grin, and held her hands in a "palm" shape, facing me. Then, she folded her right thumb.

<b>

"Ohhh!!"

<b>

As I watched Fenon's mysterious gesture, the audience erupted in exclamations.

I hurriedly returned my gaze to the stage, where Sera had her sword pointed at her brother's forehead.

<b>

However, just like before, she quickly retreated and reset the match.

<b>

I don't get it――I really don't get it.

<b>

I furrowed my brows and returned my gaze to Fenon. Then, following her thumb, her index finger was also folded.

<b>

Is she counting something? With both hands, does that mean ten times?

<b>

Ten matches... now that I think about it, I feel like I've heard something similar recently――!?

<b>

"I see..."

<b>

So that's what it is.

She didn't have to go that far to imitate me.

As I watched the match, I couldn't help but smile wryly.

<b>

What she was likely trying to do was the same thing I did with the guild master of Leinas――the ten matches I had conducted to demonstrate my skills when I told him to "show me your overwhelming strength."

<b>

She was attempting to put that into practice in front of this large audience.

In other words, she was trying to overwhelm her brother.

<b>

"What is it? Did you figure it out, Esuar?"

<b>

Shin quickly reacted to my muttering.

<b>

"Probably... well, just watch. Eight matches left."

<b>

Just as it seemed a conclusion was about to be reached again, Sera quickly retreated as if to say, "There's no way I'm ending this." That left seven matches remaining.

<b>

Regulus, the referee, appeared either stunned by Sera's inexplicable actions or surprised by her rapid growth――in any case, he was not functioning properly as a referee and was merely watching the match.

I wanted to point out whether it was acceptable for someone of his stature to behave like that. At this rate, he might not get another chance to referee.

<b>

<b>

Sera's impressive advance continued.

<b>

One moment she fought with the strong "hard" style like Ray, and the next she switched to the "soft" tactics I had taught her.

<b>

It was neither like Ray nor my own fighting style.

She had surpassed my imagination and grown stronger.

That unique way of varying her tempo was something I couldn't even begin to replicate. At the very least, it would require a considerable amount of training.

<b>

I wonder how Ray feels about this――is he frustrated, happy, or enjoying it? However, I couldn't discern that from his expression.

Ray was approaching the match with an extremely serious demeanor.

<b>

And then the tenth match.

<b>

Sera manipulated her sword to sweep Ray's weapon upward, disarming him of his means to attack. The sound of metal clanging echoed sadly through the venue.

<b>

It was a technique I had playfully shown against monsters wielding weapons during dungeon exploration, but it seemed she had made it her own without me realizing.

<b>

No, that's way too fast to learn. That's outright cheating.

<b>

Then Sera slowly lowered her sword toward Ray's head.

Though it was a movement that couldn't be considered an attack, Ray did not attempt to dodge and accepted the blow. The appropriate sound effect would be a "pop."

<b>

The arena, silent for a few seconds, erupted into deafening cheers the next moment.

<b>

Without even waiting for Regulus to call out the name of the victor, the audience acknowledged Sera's victory.
