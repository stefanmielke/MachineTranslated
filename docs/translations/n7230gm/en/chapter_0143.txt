# A-29 Talking with His Majesty

<b>

<b>

<b>

After being asked by Dino about my relationships with the women, I quickly joined everyone and headed straight to the audience with His Majesty. It seemed that Sera and the others were curious about what I had been discussing, but with no time and the presence of servants, they gave up.

<b>

I'll talk after the handover of the new house――after making that promise, we headed to the audience chamber to meet the King.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Raise your faces."

<b>

At the words from King Zeno, the four of us directed our gazes toward His Majesty.

Although we had met several times before the collapse, I still felt overwhelmed by this grand atmosphere. I wouldn't be surprised if someone said he was using intimidation skills.

<b>

In this room, besides His Majesty and Dino, there were nearly ten noble-looking individuals, a maid in uniform, and two knights serving as guards.

<b>

"To the members of the Explorer Party ASR, I apologize for summoning you suddenly. First, let me talk about the capture of the thieves. Dino, please."

<b>

As the King said this, Dino, the Chancellor, quietly stepped forward and began reading our achievements from a paper in his hand.

<b>

The content is... well, just as it is.

We captured nearly 100 pickpockets in total and destroyed their hideout.

<b>

The nobles murmured at the content Dino read, but I think their reactions were all favorable. I didn't sense any malice directed at me, nor did I feel any jealous glares.

<b>

After Dino finished detailing the content, the next topic was about the rewards.

<b>

"We are considering the construction costs for the new party house you will build in the royal capital as your reward. What do you think? If cash is more convenient, we can consider that instead."

<b>

In response to the King's question, Phenon immediately replied, "As Your Majesty wishes." To be honest, for us who have plenty of money, the truth is that "either is fine. We don't even need a reward." She probably answered quickly because she understood that.

<b>

However, it seems I've missed another chance to spend money――now that I think about it, I've never had trouble with money since coming to this world. It's a stark contrast to my previous life.

<b>

Once the discussion about capturing the thieves wrapped up, the next topic was about conquering A-rank dungeons.

This was just a matter of "I look forward to your future activities," and it ended without us receiving any rewards or titles. The nobles seemed quite stirred by hearing about the achievements of their first princess, but they quickly quieted down after being admonished by Dino.

<b>

"Now, from here on, the content will be more detailed, so I ask everyone except ASR to leave."

<b>

Oh, it seems that the formal discussion is ending here.

As I waited, exhaling a sigh of relief while the nobles exited, Noah next to me whispered in a voice that wouldn't be overheard.

<b>

"It seems they're going to talk about the servants now."

<b>

Ah, I see.

That's not something to discuss with the nobles, after all.

In any case, it's a relief to not feel tense surrounded by important people.

<b>

"I'm not so uneasy, though."

<b>

I figured as much. It would be funny if the former Creator God was nervous around nobles.

<b>

As I glanced at Noah, who was chuckling, I heard the sound of the door closing. It seems the nobles have exited.

Remaining in the room are His Majesty, Dino, one maid, and two guards. Including us ASR, there are a total of ten people.

<b>

"Ha…"

<b>

His Majesty, who had been seated on the throne, let out a breath as if he had relaxed a bit.

It seems he was also tense in front of the nobles. Being a king is tough.

<b>

"Everyone can relax; this will be an unofficial setting from here on. It should be easier for you to talk that way, right?"

<b>

"That's just what you want, isn't it... Ah, everyone, since His Majesty is in this mood, please feel free to relax, even without chairs."

<b>

Dino said with an exasperated look, and although His Majesty showed a slightly dissatisfied expression, he didn't retort and leaned back in his chair.

<b>

"First, let me convey some information――as for the new servants, I have arranged for the individuals according to Phenon's request. They should already be working there, so the face-to-face meeting will happen at the time of handover."

<b>

"Thank you, Father. How many are there?"

<b>

"You mentioned a small number, so there are two maids, one butler, and three guards."

<b>

Hmm... I don't know about the number of maids and butlers, but considering it's a place where the princess lives, the security seems low.

But well, given who the residents are, it's a rather strange situation where everyone is stronger than the guards.

<b>

By paying them a salary, it seems I can finally have a continuous expense. It's truly a mystery to be happy about spending money.

<b>

"I think you understand, but Phenon, and also Sera Bernot. Please make sure not to stay overnight at the party house. You can spend as much time as you like during the day, but if you stay overnight, it will definitely become gossip."

<b>

"Oh, Father. I wouldn't mind being the subject of gossip at all."

<b>

"You really... become so assertive when it comes to SR."

<b>

"Your Majesty. I also wish for that."

<b>

"Ah, the 'Sword Princess' too... Speaking of which."

<b>

His Majesty, with a troubled expression, placed his hand on his forehead and directed his gaze toward me.

<b>

"I believe you heard from Dino, but SR doesn't have any notable achievements. I want to prioritize the feelings of those involved, but they need a clear reason. Especially Phenon, who has turned down many engagement offers from other countries."

<b>

"Eh? Is that so?"

<b>

I involuntarily turned to Phenon and asked. She cheerfully replied, "Of course!"

While it's great that she's cheerful, is that response appropriate for this occasion? Isn't it a bit off?

<b>

"There are talks about royal blood――or that it wouldn't benefit the country――those kinds of discussions exist. I think it's a matter that doesn't concern you much as a commoner, but the nobles will pay attention to it."

<b>

"…Indeed, it's a matter that doesn't concern me much, and I don't want to be involved. But, if I become someone with a title, that would be acceptable, right?"

<b>

When I asked that, His Majesty slowly nodded and responded in a grave tone.

<b>

"Yes... However, SR is a party member alongside Phenon and Sera. Even if you achieve results in the party, it won't count as a positive factor for SR. Sera, being a noble with a title, already has a status equivalent to a duke, and Phenon is royalty. Therefore, as a commoner, SR will need to accomplish something significant on its own."

<b>

"That means a major achievement that can stand alongside them."

<b>

Dino added, seemingly pressing the point.

He had a somewhat apologetic expression, but that quickly turned into confusion.

<b>

It must be because I'm smiling.

<b>

Because, you know?

<b>

They seem to be saying something difficult, but solo play is my specialty.
