<b>

At the tavern in the noble district――Barto.

After conquering the B-rank dungeon, coming to this place naturally reminds me of the time when I first arrived in this world. The Thunderbolt Trail――and the time I came with Sera.

<b>

Back then, I still had a psychological barrier with everyone and interacted with a polite tone.

Considering how I had been playing solo all this time, it’s an unimaginable progress.

<b>

"You're not going to get drunk again, are you?"

<b>

"Please stop, Esuar... it's embarrassing..."

<b>

I think Sera back then had her tension suddenly released. She drank like a fish, and I ended up carrying her home. I don’t mind if it doesn’t affect her health on a normal day, but today it’s a bit problematic.

To prevent her from accidentally saying something strange, I teased her, saying, "Just take it easy today."

<b>

Once the waiter set five meals and drinks on the table and left, the main character of today finally opened her mouth.

<b>

"So, what do you intend by bringing me to a place like this? Are you going to turn me over to the knight order?"

<b>

Jill Vinzett glared at the three of us with an atmosphere that seemed ready to bite at any moment.

With her small appearance and slightly trembling voice... she somehow reminded me of a small animal. Like a mouse threatening a cat.

<b>

"That's not it. You know why you were brought here."

<b>

"...... Hmph. By the way, you――was it Noah? You really lack manners towards your elders, don't you?"

<b>

"Explorers are meritocratic――the Rezel Kingdom is the same, right? We're not weaker than you."

<b>

The little girls were sparking with tension――though it was just their appearance.

Noah seemed very displeased, perhaps because their time was interrupted――or maybe because she couldn’t eat her omelet rice. I found it hard to approach her.

In the charged atmosphere, a carefree person who didn’t understand anything burst into laughter.

<b>

"Hahaha! Since this is a precious opportunity for interaction, let's enjoy our meal more! ... By the way, Esuar, what are the sisters talking about?"

<b>

"Ah, well, you'll understand eventually."

<b>

"I see! Then I'll look forward to that moment!"

<b>

Hahaha!――As usual, Arnold laughed and gulped down his ale.

Sitting next to him, Sera tugged at the hem of my clothes and whispered, "Is it really okay to talk about this?"

<b>

"Umm... well, it'll be fine."

<b>

If anything, it would be more dangerous to let this go unresolved. After all, we have the Sword Princess and the First Princess here, so it would be more certain to talk properly and then ask them to keep quiet.

<b>

But before that――

<b>

"What’s with that! Acting all high and mighty with that short stature!"

<b>

"Don't you have a mirror at home? Or are your eyes made of glass?"

<b>

I need to stop these two from arguing... what a hassle.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"Ugh, fine. Thinking about it, there's no need to hide anything――it's about you guys, right? The ones Thunderbolt Trail was talking about at the martial arts tournament."

<b>

Arnold calmed Jill, and I and Sera calmed Noah, finally setting the stage for discussion.

Though the drinks were reduced, no one had touched their food yet――or so I thought, but Sera had already eaten about half. When did that happen?

<b>

At Jill's words, both Sera and I tilted our heads in unison. What on earth did they say?

<b>

"That's not true, Jill. The Sword Princess indeed had incredible skill, rivaling Shin. Esuar's archery and Lady Noah's magic were excellent too... but I don't think they reached the level of Thunderbolt Trail."

<b>

"Archery?? You mean Esuar can use a bow?"

<b>

With half-closed eyes, Jill observed my reaction. Since she used the term "you guys," I thought her suspicion was directed at ASR, but it seems I was the one being targeted.

Before giving a clear answer, I decided to ask a few questions myself.

<b>

"What did Shin say?"

<b>

"Weren't you aware of the commotion? They――Thunderbolt Trail said something like 'We can't keep losing forever' during the winner's interview. Those who claim to be the strongest in the world shouldn't say such things."

<b>

That statement must have come from Shin.

If it was unintentional, I might let it slide with a solo assault on an A-rank dungeon.

<b>

"I see. Anything else?"

<b>

"Not really. That's all."

<b>

Hmph――Jill replied with a snort. Glancing at Noah, she still wore a dissatisfied expression, and when our eyes met, she nodded slightly. It seems that's truly all there is.

<b>

"Why are you hiding your strength? There's a rumor that ASR is just a handyman, but that can't be true."

<b>

Otherwise, there's no way you could dodge my attacks so easily――she continued.

She didn't seem frustrated or angry. It felt like a simple question of "why" was all that was in her mind.

<b>

"I'll need to reveal it eventually. But for now, I don't want to stand out too much."

<b>

To get engaged to Sera and Fenon, I must graduate from being just a handyman.

When that time comes, I want to achieve something grand like conquering an SS-rank dungeon, so that those who like me and my comrades can hold their heads high.

<b>

Upon hearing my words, Jill merely responded with a "Hmph," showing no particular inclination to press further. Despite having asked, she didn't seem very interested in the reason.

<b>

"I want to see who’s the best. It’s not that I want to be number one myself. So when the international martial arts tournament was held, and Thunderbolt Trail won overwhelmingly with ridiculous strength――I was moved, thinking, 'Ah, these people are the top explorers...' The world is vast. I lost, but I was happy."

<b>

I find it hard to understand her feelings that allow her to smile while saying that.

If I'm going to do it, I want to be number one, and I don't think I could ever be happy about losing.

<b>

"That Thunderbolt Trail said something like that, right? Of course, I'm curious. I came to this country to find someone stronger――the real number one. I hadn't told my brother, though."

<b>

"I see... then for now, can I assume Jill doesn't intend to spill the beans about me?"

<b>

"There’s no benefit to spreading it around. If you want me to keep quiet, I will."

<b>

With that, she leaned on the table and started picking at the food on it.

That's rude. Aren't you a noble after all?

<b>

"But since I found you, how about a match as a hush fee? You dodged so beautifully, and while the outcome is obvious, I'm curious about how far apart the top is."

<b>

Hehe――Jill laughed cheerfully.

It felt similar to a child wanting to play a match with a professional athlete――though only they would truly understand that feeling.

In contrast to her, Arnold, who had been frowning with crossed arms, spoke gravely.

<b>

"Esuar, are you... stronger than the Sword Princess?"

<b>

Despite Noah being in sight, his eyes didn't turn into hearts.

I lightly bowed my head to the person who would likely be the biggest victim this time.

<b>

Being deceived, forcibly made aware, and then silenced――poor thing. I'm really sorry.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Arnold. Both Sera and Thunderbolt Trail are my students."

<b>

Upon hearing my words, one of the siblings showed a surprised expression, while the other seemed to understand.

<b>

"I knew it. That movement was no ordinary thing. How shall we settle this? Party battle? Individual battle? Either way, you better give it your all."

<b>

As if deciding on a picnic plan, she spoke excitedly.

I couldn't respond to her question and could only manage a wry smile.

<b>

Because, giving it my all――that feels like a high difficulty level.

<b>

"Jill Vinzett――was it? You are underestimating Esuar too much."

<b>

Bang――Sera said, slamming her ale-filled mug on the table. She had been adding drinks in between but hadn’t drunk enough to get drunk――I think. No, I want to think so.

<b>

"I'm not underestimating him at all. I don't think I can win."

<b>

"No, Esuar is amazing. Just how amazing? He’s incredibly amazing. Got it?"

<b>

"Ah, um... I got it."

<b>

Jill seemed to understand something and smoothly backed down.

If I were in her position, I might have reacted the same way. This response seems to be the right one.

<b>

"But you know, Jill, she's drunk, but what she's saying is true, right? You still underestimate your big brother."

<b>

Following Sera's words, another little girl joined the conversation.

After saying that, she paused for a moment, then spoke with a sigh.

<b>

<b>

"Trying to get your big brother to go all out is like asking to be killed. Do you want to die?"
