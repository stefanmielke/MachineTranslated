# A-102 Maybe I Have a Bad Personality

<b>

<b>

<b>

I ended up grabbing the arrow shot by Soubi-san without even trying to evade it.

No, what am I doing, acting like this is a demonstration of evasion training...? If I was anxious about what was behind me, I should at least have evaded before grabbing it. But thinking that now doesn't solve any problems.

From my perspective, it only seems like a problem has arisen, but there isn't really any significant issue happening around us. It's just that there are a lot of people looking blankly.

<b>

So, I had Soubi-san shoot another arrow while I was still dazed, and I dodged it. This time, I confirmed that there was no problem with evading.

After repeating that several times and proving it wasn't just luck, Soubi-san nodded in admiration and spoke up.

<b>

"Wow... what incredible reflexes you have, 'Hao-sama.'"

<b>

"That way of addressing me is a bit embarrassing, so I'd prefer if you just called me 'Esuar.'"

<b>

"Esuar, huh? Now that you mention it, that was your name."

<b>

Ah, I hadn't introduced myself yet. That's something to reflect on.

After apologizing for forgetting to introduce myself, I got back to the main topic.

<b>

"Getting back to the point, about evasion. It's true that I have better reflexes than most people, but that's not all there is to it. It's about the starting point of movement, or rather, reading the breathing. While archery is less obvious compared to swords or fists, once you get used to it, you'll start to understand it intuitively."

<b>

If you can't read it, you lose—it's a silly formula, but that's how I've managed to survive in Tempest.

I can't tell everyone, "You need to be able to do this," nor do I intend to, but I'd be happy if they could learn a bit and appreciate the fun of evasion.

It's not like I'm keeping it a secret or anything.

<b>

"That's a complicated topic... By the way, how did you know I was going to shoot an arrow?"

<b>

"It’s about your gaze, the direction of the arrow, how you tense your fingers and arms, and even your toes. The timing is like adding your breathing into the mix."

<b>

That's what I consciously focus on, but I think I'm also observing a lot of other things that I can't articulate. So I can say that I'm looking at the whole picture.

<b>

"You mean you can see all that while fighting? That seems impossible."

<b>

Soubi-san said with a furrowed brow. But since I can actually do it, it's not impossible.

<b>

"Then how about we give it a try? You can all come at me together, and I’ll be fine with that."

<b>

I realized after saying that. Why do I always try to turn things into a fight so quickly?

I thought to myself that it’s no wonder I’m called a battle maniac, a battle junkie, or a dungeon addict.

<b>

A battle of twelve against one. Soubi-san suggested using non-lethal weapons to avoid serious injuries, but since there are magic users on their side and Soubi-san seems to be leveling up as a secondary class magic archer, I requested to proceed as if it were a real battle, without holding back. After all, you can't hold back when shooting magical arrows.

<b>

So, I decided to face them unarmed.

Since this is an extension of evasion training, I won’t be attacking. I’ll let them observe how I move during the fight, and later, we’ll have a Q&A session.

<b>

"Normally, I’d be in the mood to say 'Don’t underestimate me.'"

<b>

"If you say that, I’ll retort, 'Don’t underestimate Esuar.'"

<b>

At those words from Sera, Soubi-san replied with a laugh, "Is that so?"

It seemed they noticed we were doing a mock battle of many against one, as Sera and the swordsmen she was instructing came to watch. It would be dangerous if magic or arrows started flying, so it was a reasonable precaution.

<b>

I felt a bit guilty for interrupting them, but since Sera was explaining while instructing, it didn’t seem like a complete disruption. Noah was just happily watching. You should do a little work too.

<b>

I stood before the twelve explorers who had gathered in a chaotic manner.

My profession is the unyielding 'Hao.' I don’t plan to use any skills, but thanks to my constantly active 'Pinnacle of Martial Arts' and 'Master of Magic,' my stats are boosted.

This time, it’s more about letting them understand the fighting style of the Tempest rankers than about having a good match, so this is fine. No matter what anyone says, this is good enough. Probably.

<b>

"There won’t be a decisive conclusion... So, shall we set a time limit? Or should we keep going until we’re tired?"

<b>

"There’s a possibility that Esuar could get beaten up and give up, you know?"

<b>

With a bow that was no joke taken out from my inventory, Soubi-san smirked. I matched his expression with a similar one.

<b>

"I’d love to hear whether that possibility is even one in a million after the mock battle."

<b>

I don’t have much experience in battles with more than ten opponents, so I’m really looking forward to it.

<b>

<b>

"What? Are you kidding me? Do you have eyes on the back of your head or something?!"

<b>

"I don’t even feel a hint of danger!"

<b>

"This person can see the future. There’s definitely something wrong."

<b>

"If we go one-on-one, there’s no way we’ll hit him. We have to cooperate to attack."

<b>

"This is the world’s best—just don’t shoot arrows over here!"

<b>

"Guild Master, can’t you do something about this? Where’s your usual bravado?"

<b>

"Who are you talking to like that!? I’ll lower the buyback price for dropped items!"

<b>

"I’m sorry!"

<b>

While thinking how lively it was, I faced off against the twelve.

Perhaps due to Rezell's original temperament, there was hardly any team play, and it felt more like a total war of individual skills. A few explorers started cooperating midway, but it was mostly solo play, starting with Soubi-san. I recalled that the Vinzett siblings had mentioned something like that before.

<b>

About thirty minutes into the match.

<b>

After confirming that the explorers who had exhausted themselves weren’t getting up, I walked over to Soubi-san, who was lying on his back, breathing heavily, and I asked with a sly smile.

<b>

"Did it seem likely that I would give up?"

<b>

"—Hah, hah... Esuar, after this result, asking that question is just plain mean."

<b>

Yes, I’m very sorry.
