# A-92 The Two's Residence

"Then I'll call you Hisui. Now, shall we talk about what's next?"

<b>

"Yes, please."

<b>

Straightening her posture, Hisui nodded as if she were about to take an interview.

<b>

"I'm a billionaire."

<b>

"Huh? Ah, eh? That's amazing."

<b>

She responded somewhat ambiguously.

I wanted to convey to her that she didn't have to worry about food, clothing, or shelter, but it somehow came out awkwardly. I reflected on that.

<b>

"What are you bragging about all of a sudden?"

<b>

"I misspoke—what I meant to say is that you don't have to worry about where to live. I have more than enough money to live lavishly."

<b>

"Is that from the dungeon?"

<b>

"Exactly. When I first arrived, the people in this world couldn't even get elixirs, so I was able to earn a lot."

<b>

"That's true... and in reality, the demand for such recovery items seems high."

<b>

"That's right."

<b>

I brought up that topic to ease her tension, but it seems that Hisui, like Crescent, has carried over her level, so if she wants to earn money, she can do so quickly.

After all, Hisui is the third-ranked player in the Tempest personal rankings.

Although she is inferior to Crescent, her power is something that the people of this world cannot contend with.

<b>

"I'm currently living with Esuar, but what about you, Hime-chan? You could also live together with me, you know?"

<b>

Crescent asked, tilting her head.

Hmm... it's true that I have invited Crescent into my home, but the other members are ASR's party members, and with my two wives, one potential wife, and a god at home, it might be hard to say it's comfortable. While it might be reassuring, it could also be awkward.

<b>

"I don't want to be a bother to Esuar... hmm."

<b>

With her index finger and thumb on her chin, Hisui pondered.

After about ten seconds of contemplation, she raised her hand and asked, "Can I ask a question?"

I encouraged her to go ahead and waited for her question.

<b>

"How much money do you think I could earn to build a house?"

<b>

"Solo? Or with Crescent?"

<b>

"I'll do it too!"

<b>

"In that case, I think you could build a fairly luxurious house in about a week."

<b>

When I calculated it again in my head, it was quite a cheat-like number of days.

They would easily be able to clear B rank, A rank, or even S rank, and a week seems like a very generous estimate.

<b>

"I feel a bit guilty about that..."

<b>

"I thought so too. But well, let's just consider it a win-win situation."

<b>

We can easily earn money.

And the people of this world will have a good supply of high-performance weapons, armor, and recovery items.

Even if she reincarnated in this world with power, it shouldn't be a trivial issue.

<b>

In any case, even if she came to this world at level 1, her future of becoming wealthy seems guaranteed.

<b>

"So, is it settled that we'll build a new home together? Where should it be? The safety is pretty good everywhere, so you can choose wherever you like. I would feel more at ease if it's somewhere easy to contact."

<b>

Since they are both from the same hometown and younger, and I have known them for a long time, I can't help but take on a somewhat protective perspective.

Of course, they are adults, so they can probably live independently without my help, but considering that this is a different world, I can't help but worry a little.

<b>

"Is it okay if it's next door?"

<b>

"…Next door, to this house?"

<b>

Well, I mean, in terms of space, that's true... but isn't that a bit too close? I thought the closest place would be Renus, but I wouldn't normally think of next door.

<b>

"Yes, that's right. Is Mika okay too?"

<b>

"I'm fine with it! It makes communication easy!"

<b>

The two of them are excited. As party members, they really are in sync.

<b>

"Well, that might be easy, but—there are communication magic tools that can serve as phones, so you don't necessarily have to be super close to each other, you know?"

<b>

"Do you dislike it?"

<b>

"Do you dislike it?"

<b>

They asked me with grins.

Being pressed by two younger girls like this is something that hasn't happened to me before—well, maybe a few times with Sera and Phenon? Still, I'm not used to it.

<b>

"…I'll consult with the other members."

<b>

Abandoning a clear response, I might indeed be a coward.
