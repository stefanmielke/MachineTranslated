# 13 The Lovesick Maiden

<b>

This is another story from Serah's perspective.

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In a room of the royal castle.

<b>

Phenon ordered the maid to leave, and it was just the two of us left in the room. Even in my room, as the daughter of an earl, it pales in comparison to the private chamber of the first princess.

<b>

However, the furniture and linens—while of the highest quality—do not give off an impression of opulence. This is due to her preferences.

<b>

Once I confirmed that the door was closed, I sat down on the bed where Phenon was lying without permission. I always sit in this spot when I come to this room. Of course, this is only when we are alone together.

<b>

"It’s been quite a while. I’m sorry for being late."

<b>

"You don’t have to worry about it. I’ve heard a little from Dino. It seems you’ve been quite reckless."

<b>

"…I regret it."

<b>

I was immediately met with a reprimand. I had somewhat expected it, so I wasn’t surprised.

<b>

I met Phenon at the party held on the day she turned five, and we have maintained a good relationship ever since. Of course, there have been times we fought, but those moments also deepened our bond. Now, she is an irreplaceable friend.

<b>

"You were with the escort of SR, right? Tell me about it."

<b>

"Well, it seems you’re quite curious about it, Phenon."

<b>

"Of course! After all, he’s my hero!"

<b>

After she finished saying that, her cheerful expression changed completely—she began to cough painfully. Blood spilled from the hand that covered her mouth.

I hurriedly propped Phenon up and handed her a handkerchief, then gently rubbed her back. Once her coughing subsided, I had her take a sip from the high-grade potion that was on her bedside.

Then, I slowly returned her to her original position. This procedure had become familiar to me by now.

<b>

"Is it painful?"

<b>

"I got a bit too excited. I’m fine, it’s just the usual."

<b>

She said that while forcing a smile.

There’s no way it wouldn’t be painful if she’s coughing up blood.

<b>

She fell ill about three years ago.

Though I can’t pinpoint the exact date. It’s a disease that gradually eats away at her internal organs.

Generally, common illnesses can be cured by drinking potions, but some only have effects that merely delay the symptoms. In this country, several hundred people lose their lives to it each year.

<b>

"Don’t raise your voice too much. It puts a strain on your body."

<b>

"I know that."

<b>

"Do you really understand? Honestly… Well then, let’s start from when we first met at the guild."

<b>

"Okay!"

<b>

She truly looks happy.

It’s only natural, considering she spends her days mostly lying down.

<b>

Before coming to this room, I was summoned by Lord Dino.

Usually, when I visited Phenon, I was directly guided to her room, so I was confused. After hearing the story, I was even more bewildered.

<b>

Apparently, they told Phenon that SR is a hero. It was necessary to give her hope, they explained.

Upon hearing those words, I had said, "Understood," but inwardly I let out a big sigh.

<b>

Because Phenon has the ability to see through people's lies.

<b>

She doesn’t rely on skills or magical tools; it’s purely her own power. She can tell from slight changes in expression or eye movements. This is something only Phenon and I know.

<b>

"Hey, can I stop calling him 'hero' for a moment? I’ve been calling him SR or you, so it feels a bit awkward."

<b>

"No way. After all, he’s my hero."

<b>

Phenon said with a sulky expression. While she looks quite mature in front of the citizens, she sometimes shows a childish side when she’s with me.

<b>

"You know, right? That SR isn’t really a hero."

<b>

"Even if he doesn’t think so himself, even if everyone in the world says he’s not a hero, to me, he’s still my hero."

<b>

"You’re as stubborn as ever… Fine, fine. I’ll call him hero."

<b>

"Yes. It’s good that you understand."

<b>

Then, I told her about my encounter with SR, the mock battle, what he accomplished, and how he told me he 'disliked' me—all of it.

I think I must have wanted someone to listen to me.

As proof of that, after sharing with Phenon, I felt a little lighter in my heart.

<b>

However, I didn’t mention what he said about 'how to become stronger' when we parted.

If what SR said about becoming stronger is true, then it’s probably not through legitimate means. I had a guilty feeling in my heart, and that made me hesitate to share it with her.

<b>

After listening to my story, Phenon spoke with a serious expression.

<b>

"Do you think SR has amazing talent?"

<b>

She was referring to the part about the fight.

<b>

"Honestly, I don’t know. But if I don’t think he has talent, it feels like all my efforts up to now are being denied. The difference was that overwhelming."

<b>

So I think that’s why I can’t bring myself to acknowledge it.

<b>

Phenon said, "He’s that amazing, huh?" with a happy expression, then continued,

<b>

"I don’t know about talent, but… after hearing your story about SR, don’t you think he’s strong because he’s working hard?"

<b>

She said that.

<b>

It felt more like she was trying to make me understand rather than asking a question.

<b>

SR’s efforts… huh.

How could I possibly know about that? After all, we lived in different worlds. I wouldn’t know what kind of days he had unless he talked about it himself.

<b>

"I’ll tell you one thing. He told me, 'A B-rank dungeon is a piece of cake.' He said that with such confidence."

<b>

"Is that so…"

<b>

Phenon must have been picturing that scene in her mind—she was looking up at the ceiling with a smile.

<b>

Hearing her words, I felt relieved. I understood that SR was working to save the princess.

Even if I and the Thunderbolt’s trail couldn’t conquer it, surely SR could handle a B-rank dungeon while humming a tune. That’s what I thought.

<b>

However, I didn’t understand the context of the conversation.

Wasn’t it about SR’s efforts? Just as I was about to ask Phenon about her intentions, her mouth moved again. It was an unexpected statement.

<b>

"That was a lie, though."

<b>

"—What!? Is that true!?"

<b>

It is true—after saying that, she directed her gaze at me. It was a rare reproachful look from her.

<b>

"For the hero, conquering a B-rank dungeon isn’t easy either. That’s why he started diving into dungeons from the day he arrived in this world. The next day too, and the day after that, from morning till night. For someone he had just met, like me. Can you believe that? You were watching it up close, weren’t you?"

<b>

I could only look down at that question. She was absolutely right. I had been watching what he did up close.

<b>

What do you mean I don’t know because we lived in different worlds?

What do you mean I don’t know what kind of days he had?

<b>

Because he seemed fine and made it look so easy, I hadn’t realized how harsh those ten days had been for him.

<b>

In a dungeon filled with monsters, where he could be attacked at any moment, SR spent his days from morning till night. Since he was going solo, he couldn’t even afford to relax by having a lookout.

And once he defeated the monsters, the countdown timer would immediately activate.

<b>

Such days… I would probably go insane.

<b>

At midnight, he would return to the inn from the dungeon to sleep, and then he would head back to the dungeon early in the morning again.

Anyone who saw or heard about it would surely say he was hardworking or stoic.

<b>

I had said that someone like him was 'blessed with talent'… He would have every right to be angry.

<b>

"Do you understand now?"

<b>

Phenon gently spoke to me, who was momentarily stunned. Then she continued with her words.

<b>

"I think he doesn’t show much on his face when he’s in pain or struggling. Do you know? When the hero was summoned to this world, he supposedly held his head and vomited right there."

<b>

"I can’t really imagine that…"

<b>

"Right? I was shocked when I heard it later. He seemed so dignified. He was really bad at lying, though."

<b>

Remembering that moment, Phenon chuckled. Then she opened her mouth again.

<b>

"The hero might not have had family or friends, and he might not be able to see his lover anymore. In this world, there’s no one he can rely on."

<b>

And once again, I was made aware.

I had completely forgotten about that due to his overly natural behavior.

<b>

Last night, he said one of the conditions was, "Trust what I say."

<b>

Perhaps that statement was a reflection of his own desire for someone he could trust. After all, he was alone in this world.

<b>

Phenon placed her hand over mine. Her hand was thin and cold.

<b>

"So, Serah, please be a support for the hero."

<b>

"…If there’s something I can do, then I will."

<b>

"It’s okay. You’re a hard worker, Serah. I’m sure it will make the hero happy too."

<b>

"I hope so. I can’t say we’re on good terms, but I’ll try to talk to him again."

<b>

At this point, I decided to head to the guild tomorrow morning.

If he’s going to teach me how to become stronger, no matter what method it is, I will become strong. And then, I will be of help to him and save Phenon.

<b>

"Yes. Let’s start with making up first."

<b>

"Ugh… I’m not good at apologizing, but I’ll give it my best shot."

<b>

I couldn’t help but smile wryly. Seeing me like that, Phenon chuckled softly again. Looking at her carefree smile, I felt a sense of discomfort.

<b>

"By the way, Phenon. Even though you know he’s not a hero and that conquering a B-rank dungeon isn’t easy, why can you smile so much?"

<b>

At first, I thought it was bravado. But after years of knowing her, I understood.

She wasn’t afraid of death right now. She looked a bit different from her expression before SR came.

<b>

In response to my question, Phenon answered happily.

<b>

"Hehe. To be honest, when I realized that his words were a lie, I thought, 'Ah, I’m really going to die like this.' I thought he must have been told by someone in the royal castle to come comfort me—at least, that’s what I thought."

<b>

"Then why?"

<b>

"Finally, the hero told me this. Not with comforting or lying words, but with true words."

<b>

<b>

"I will definitely save you," he said.

<b>

<b>

The way Phenon spoke was truly that of a lovesick maiden.
