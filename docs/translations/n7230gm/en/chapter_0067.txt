# 64 The Two Excited About Their New Home

<b>

<b>

<b>

The beautiful maid――Siri prepared a new drink, and the plate in the center of the table was replenished with sweets.

Of course, both Sera and I, as well as our master Phenon, expressed our gratitude to her.

<b>

As soon as Siri took her seat, I immediately got to the main topic.

<b>

"I think Phenon and Siri have become strong enough to fight. So I’m thinking it’s about time we make B-rank dungeons our main battlefield."

<b>

Normally, it would have been fine to take a bit more time, but while the two of them may not have the abnormal growth speed of Sera, they are growing at a speed that exceeds my expectations. It’s not about the strength of their talent, but rather the strength of their effort.

<b>

The first to react to my words was Sera.

She placed her hand on her chin and said, "So that means…"

<b>

"It’s a choice between an elixir or a ring… or perhaps another B-rank dungeon?"

<b>

"No, there are no drops better than a ring in a B-rank dungeon. That’s why I want to make Renus our base."

<b>

There are indeed dungeons that drop other weapons and armor, as well as dungeons with a higher drop rate for advanced potions, but they aren’t very appealing. Besides, we have decent equipment given to us by the duke.

<b>

Sera looked down at her left hand and stroked the ring on her middle finger with her right hand.

<b>

"Certainly, the effect of this ring is incredible… If we’re going into a dungeon seeking this, won’t it turn into a long-term battle? The number we want isn’t just one or two, right?"

<b>

"That’s right. At least one of each――so six in total. I think it will take about six months to a year."

<b>

If I were to operate solo, I would head to an A-rank dungeon as soon as I got a ring that boosts my firepower――and then to an S-rank dungeon, but considering the whole party, it will inevitably take at least this long.

<b>

That said, unlike during the game era, even this leisurely pace is probably astonishingly fast for the people of this world.

<b>

"I can’t keep relying on Duke Margus forever, so I’m planning to either buy or build a house――"

<b>

As I said this, I looked at each of the party members gathered around the table.

<b>

Phenon’s eyes immediately sparkled, and he began to fidget as if he wanted to say something. Watching his master, Siri wore a wry smile.

By the way, Sera had a blank expression. It seems she didn’t quite understand the flow of the conversation.

<b>

"Are you saying we can go together!?"

<b>

Finally unable to hold back, Phenon leaned forward on the table and asked. I also wore a similar wry smile as Siri and replied, "That’s right."

<b>

"Of course, I won’t force you. You can leave the party and stay in the royal capital, or if you want to work with me in Renus, you can live somewhere else. I want to live with these four――and dive into dungeons together."

<b>

"Of course, I will go! Even if my father opposes it, I will definitely follow you, Sir S.R.――Mr. S.R.!"

<b>

That’s a bit much――I thought for a moment, but then I quickly remembered that there was no need to worry about that. I already have the king’s permission.

<b>

"If Lord Phenon is going, then I will naturally accompany you. Besides… it feels strange to go back to being just an ordinary maid after being trained so hard."

<b>

Following Phenon, Siri also expressed her agreement.

Now it’s just Sera left――but in her case, she had already been staying at my house, so there wouldn’t be much change with just a change of city.

<b>

"If we want to meet the requests of all four of us, it would be better to build a house from scratch. Since we have a lot of money, there’s no point in just keeping it in our pockets. Let’s build a big house!"

<b>

Sera said this as if it were the most natural thing in the world, without even indicating her intention to "go together." It seems that her going is already a done deal.

What can I say… that’s so like her.

<b>

"I heard that Sera’s parent――the count, wanted to talk, so since I’m responsible for a young lady, I’d like to greet him as the party leader. Once that’s done, we can head to Renus."

<b>

To avoid any misunderstandings, I emphasized the "party leader" part. I’m not going to say something like "Please give me your daughter." At least, not yet.

<b>

Are they looking forward to their future life――Phenon and Siri nodded with expressions full of motivation and hope.

<b>

"Then I’ll clear my father’s schedule right away. We should be able to depart by tomorrow morning."

<b>

Sera said this and stood up from the sofa, striding toward the entrance.

<b>

"――――Huh?"

<b>

No, no, no, no!

That’s way too presumptuous, isn’t it!? Consider the count’s circumstances a little!

Phenon is also saying, "Hurry up," and I feel no intention from my friend to stop her.

<b>

"Stop! Stoooooooop! Calm down, Sera! Just come back here for now!!"

<b>

As I hurriedly raised my voice, Sera walked up to me with a puzzled expression. She tilted her head, as if to say, "What’s wrong?"

<b>

I felt an urge to strike her on the head, but I held back. I am much more mature than her in terms of mental age.

<b>

I took a deep breath and then opened my mouth.

<b>

"I don’t think of myself as important, and even if the title of 'Hero' had the same power as the count’s family, I don’t want to do anything that would annoy others."

<b>

"Hmm… But if it’s a request from S.R., I think he would be willing to accommodate a little? My father is grateful to you, so I think it’s okay to be a bit more assertive."

<b>

"Even so! We have plenty of time, so there’s no need to rush, right? Please ask the count for a schedule that’s not too demanding."

<b>

If it turns out that I have to wait more than a month, I’ll consider other options, but from Sera’s actions, it doesn’t seem like the count is far away. He’s probably at home.

<b>

"If S.R. says so… understood. I will convey that to my father."

<b>

Did she really understand――I wanted to retort as I watched Sera, full of action, walk away.

Siri let out a dry laugh, still frowning, saying, "Hahaha…" I probably had a similar expression from the sidelines.

<b>

<b>

An hour later. When Sera returned to my house, she reported that the count had cleared his schedule for tomorrow morning.

<b>

She had a triumphant expression, and despite not sweating at all, she made a gesture as if wiping her forehead. Phenon was applauding his friend.

<b>

Siri and I let out small sighs as we watched the two of them.
