# A-25 New Home?

"---So, we parted ways with the Vinzett siblings right after we exited the dungeon. It would have been a hassle if they kept following us, and we would probably meet again anyway."

<b>

The former base located within the royal castle grounds.

<b>

Even though it's a former base, the current users are still limited to us due to Phenon's arrangements, so there isn't much difference from before the world collapsed. The only change is that the number of nights spent here has decreased.

Despite not being used much, the cleaning is done as a matter of course, and there's not a speck of dust in sight. Thank you as always, maids.

<b>

"Did that happen while I was sleeping...? I'm sorry."

<b>

"You don't have to apologize. There was a limit on the number of participants anyway, so it actually saved us the trouble of deciding who would join."

<b>

After leaving the dungeon, we parted ways with the dazed Arnold siblings and had lunch with Suzu and Laika, partly to adjust our schedule.

<b>

And then, noon.

<b>

As the royal guards greeted us with a "Long time no see!" in a friendly manner, we headed to our usual doghouse.

Of course, Phenon and Shiri were there, and since Noah and I come frequently, we could basically enter without any checks. It seemed that Phenon had arranged things in advance this time, making the inspection even more relaxed.

<b>

Inside the building, besides Phenon and Shiri, there was also Sera, who had been out of it from drinking yesterday.

<b>

"Are you feeling better from your hangover?"

<b>

"I'm fine now... I drank a potion."

<b>

I didn't intend to be angry, but Sera was looking down at the table, seeming to reflect on herself. It made me sad to see her so downcast, so I decided to end this topic by saying something to encourage her not to overburden herself.

<b>

While we all enjoyed the coffee and tea that Shiri brewed, we didn't really have any specific topics to discuss; it was like a school break where everyone brought up random subjects.

<b>

Of course, we talked about the Arnold siblings, my match, the international martial arts tournament, the story of taking down the thieves' hideout, and a recently opened delicious café, among other things. We simply spent a leisurely time together.

<b>

Ah... this is nice.

<b>

This time with no particular work to do, just lazing around.

It's like I can think about what I like, or not think about anything at all—well, I should be thinking about the important event of marrying the two of them, but still.

<b>

...Actually, there are still some issues.

<b>

I might not even need to use the word "issue," but I've realized something recently.

I suspect that Shiri and Noah might have romantic feelings for me. I want to believe I'm not being overly self-conscious.

<b>

As for Noah, it might just be part of her act, so it's too early to conclude, but I think Shiri probably... has about a 60% chance of having feelings for me. During the incident with the thieves, she was unusually enthusiastic despite the reward being terrible. When our hands touched, her face turned bright red, and she seems to treat me as someone special.

<b>

And I can't help but feel that Sera and Phenon are supporting Shiri's feelings. If I'm wrong about this, it would be incredibly embarrassing, so the downside is that I can't confirm it with anyone. If I read their minds, I'll smack them, damn kids.

<b>

So, I'm really troubled.

<b>

I haven't even had my important wedding with the two of them, and now there's going to be another one? Of course, I've thought Shiri was beautiful since we first met, but come on, isn't this a bit too much for me?

Is it like all the popularity I never had in my previous life is now rushing in all at once?

<b>

Ah, no good, no good. I was having a nice lazy time, and now my thought process is about to short-circuit. Reset. Don't think about anything. Let's check the contents of my inventory in my mind.

<b>

...

<b>

...

<b>

...I really need to do something about Sera's panties.

<b>

"Don't you want to buy a house in the royal capital, Esuar? I think it's inconvenient to always stay at an inn."

<b>

As I was about to get overwhelmed by the incident I had just recalled, Suzu asked me, completely unaware of it.

<b>

"...A house? Huh, I haven't really thought about it, but it's true that when we gather, it's either the guild or here. It would be nice to have a place we can use casually."

<b>

Clearly, my expenses were far greater than my income, and I was struggling to find a place to spend it. Buying a house might be a good idea for stimulating the economy of the Lindell Kingdom.

<b>

"Yes, yes! Since we'll be contributing half from the Thunderbolt's Trail, I hope we can make more rooms. We haven't bought a house yet, so we want a place to stay. Oh, and please make my room spacious!"

<b>

"I want my room to be in a place where the morning sun shines in."

<b>

"I want a corner room."

<b>

Even though I hadn't given the go-ahead with a "Let's do that," the members of Thunderbolt's Trail began voicing their requests. It almost seemed like they were trying to force the conversation forward. Hey, we haven't even gotten the approval of the ASR members yet.

<b>

Speaking of which, nobody from Shin's group challenged Suzu's suggestion, even though they should be sharing the same wallet... It seems like there was a possibility they had coordinated from the start. I don't really care, though.

<b>

"Then how about the inn that used to be the hideout of the thieves? The owner has surely been caught, so the land should be vacant—what do you think, Esuar?"

<b>

"Ah, that place. I think it's good."

<b>

"Oh! Speaking of which, that place had a basement and quite a bit of land! It seems like a convenient location, and even though it was used by criminals, there shouldn't be any problems if we rebuild it from scratch."

<b>

"The only big expense we have is probably that. We can get what we need from the dungeon ourselves, and I think it's fine to build one house in each town."

<b>

"I want a big cupboard! And we need to make sure there's enough space for hanging laundry!"

<b>

Following Phenon, other members also began to express positive remarks.

<b>

Having money really gives you freedom... The discussion about whether to buy a house was decided in just two or three minutes. Normally, buying a house is a once-in-a-lifetime purchase, so it wouldn't be strange to ponder it for years.

I can't quite judge whether it's the other world that's amazing or if it's this group that's amazing.

<b>

<b>

In the end, that day, discussions about the new home continued late into the night, and we decided to place an order for the building the next day. Isn't that a bit too fast?

It was suggested that we should hire staff to manage the building, and Phenon said she would consult her father about that.

Since it's a building that the first princess, Phenon, will also use, I don't think they'll send anyone strange, but I still feel a bit uneasy. Not about security, but more like, I hope they aren't a scary person or something like that.

<b>

<b>

Well, I guess it will work out somehow.
