# A-15 At the B-Rank Dungeon

<b>

<b>

<b>

A B-rank dungeon near the royal capital.

This place is the second most frequented dungeon after the one where you can obtain the ring that boosts abilities.

Of course, this doesn't count the explorations from the game era; it's only about this world.

<b>

In order to fulfill the wish of a noble from another country who wanted to visit a dungeon where elixirs can be obtained, the three of us—me, Noah, and Sera—came to the dungeon in a carriage with Arnold.

<b>

And now, the first layer.

<b>

"Then we'll take care of the leftover enemies, so feel free to move around as you like."

<b>

"Then let's do that! Hahaha! A new dungeon makes my heart race!"

<b>

Upon entering the dungeon, Arnold immediately spotted a bipedal wolf—a kobold—nearby. He drew his longsword from the sheath at his waist and dashed off eagerly.

I predict that, like me, he enjoys fighting, especially since he came all the way to another country hoping for a rematch with the Thunderbolt Trail.

<b>

Noticing Arnold charging at him, the kobold bared its fangs, revealing its hostility. As the distance closed further, the enemy swung its club towards Arnold's abdomen—

<b>

"Hah! Too slow, too slow!"

<b>

However, that attack missed.

Arnold dodged the club with a backstep and lunged at the kobold with a loud "Woooah!" His attack was parried by the club, but the kobold staggered back from the force.

<b>

"Looks like he's doing fine."

<b>

I was on standby, ready to assist at any moment, but it didn't seem like he needed help. He wasn't attempting any reckless attacks and was carefully observing the enemy's movements. Just keeping him in sight should be enough.

<b>

I can't say for sure after just one exchange, but in terms of stats, he likely doesn't match Sera or Shin, and soloing a B-rank dungeon would be difficult for him—this is my impression.

<b>

"I don't think he can handle an ogre."

<b>

"It might be tough even against a level four orc."

<b>

Noah and Sera, who were watching the battle beside me, each gave their evaluations of Arnold's skills.

When orcs are mentioned, that incident inevitably comes to mind.

<b>

"Like Sera did, stabbing it with a sword."

<b>

"I-I won't do anything so foolish again! That was a terrible memory, so please let me forget it..."

<b>

"You can't forget that. It's a good lesson that you shouldn't stab a muscle-bound opponent."

<b>

"Ugh... how mean."

<b>

Sera muttered that and looked down sulkily.

<b>

I will never forget. It was when we delved into the B-rank dungeon to save Phenon.

<b>

Sera stabbed an orc with her sword, but it got stuck in its muscle and she couldn't pull it out. Unable to think of abandoning the sword, Sera took an attack from the orc in an unguarded state and was seriously injured. Although potions and healing magic saved her life, she couldn't participate in the battle afterward.

<b>

Man, I was really panicking back then.

<b>

The words I just said might seem a bit harsh coming from me, but I never want to see that kind of scene again.

<b>

Noticing Sera pouting, Noah asked, "What profession did you come as?"

Caught off guard by the sudden change of topic, Sera blinked for a moment before answering, "I'm a barrier mage."

<b>

"Even though I'm here to protect Arnold, with Noah and Esuar around, I probably won't have much of a role. So I thought I'd level up while I can—but was that a mistake?"

<b>

Perhaps because she had just been pointed out by me, she looked up at me with a questioning gaze.

<b>

"No, not at all. I haven't been saying much lately, but it looks like you're leveling up evenly. Good job."

<b>

I have a style of praising to encourage growth.

<b>

"Fufu, I'm Esuar's disciple, after all! Of course!"

<b>

In less than a minute, Sera was completely in a good mood. She's such a simple-minded girl.

I feel like Noah might have asked that question on purpose, but it doesn't really matter. What matters is the result.

<b>

"By the way, what professions did you two choose?"

<b>

Since Arnold seemed to be fine and there didn't appear to be any enemies around, we continued our conversation while keeping a close distance to him.

<b>

"I'm a saint, just in case. It helps save potions when I get injured."

<b>

"I never thought I'd hear the word 'save' from the former god... Oh, I'm a spirit archer."

<b>

"That's very human-like! Besides, even gods save their divine power!"

<b>

"Yes, yes. The creation god is so great. Oh, 'former' right?"

<b>

"That was definitely on purpose!"

<b>

"Um, both of you? Since Arnold is nearby, you might want to lower your voices or choose your words carefully..."

<b>

That's very true.

Along with Noah, we both apologized, "We're sorry," and chose to lower our voices while keeping the topic the same.

<b>

By the way, this fake little sister has a level of 30 in her first job, and levels of 60 in her second job, derived second jobs, and third jobs. However, these numbers are based on when the new world was created, and she should have leveled up quite a bit since then.

This is due to the decision of the creation god of Earth, Ja Rori—Lady Idea, but she seems to be enjoying leveling up just like us.

<b>

"If we're going to assist, we'll have to think about what skills to use."

<b>

In the eyes of the public, only the three of us from the Thunderbolt Trail have reached the third job. So, in a situation where Arnold is watching, we can't use many second job skills.

<b>

"Esuar seems fine with just one sword, no matter the job. No need to rely on skills."

<b>

"Wouldn't it be better to fight barehanded?"

<b>

In response to my words, one replied proudly while the other smiled teasingly.

<b>

"That's true... it might take a little longer without a weapon."

<b>

I can also fight primarily with martial arts, like Laika.

In the ranking battles of the game, there were times when I had my weapon thrown away, so I trained properly. If I couldn't do at least that, there's no way I could rise to the top ranks against five opponents with nearly the same stats.

<b>

"Hmm..."

<b>

Now that I think about it, it seems that there are more people in this world who handle swords compared to the game.

Shin, Sera, and Lyle—Arnold is the same.

<b>

Were there people specialized in magic or martial arts in the international martial arts tournament?

I might ask Arnold about it during the break between layers.
