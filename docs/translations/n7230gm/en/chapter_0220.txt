# A-103 Safe? Strategy

<b>

<b>

<b>

At the Explorer Guild of the Rezel Kingdom, for about two hours, Sera and I provided guidance to the local explorers. Perhaps because it was right after a serious match, they were all focused on my words and seemed to treat me with a certain level of respect.

<b>

By the way, since Noah had been slacking off the whole time, I kept thinking in my head, "You should do something too," and eventually, she brought me a drink.

I wonder if it's okay that I forgive her so easily... Even though she is a deity whose age is indeterminate, she looks like a girl in the upper grades of elementary school, so that might be part of the reason. Just to clarify, I'm not a lolicon.

<b>

After finishing the guidance, I sat on a bench in the corner of the training ground and sighed while watching the explorers train.

I was thinking about things completely unrelated to the training.

<b>

"What should I do...?"

<b>

"What's wrong, SR? If you have a problem, let me know."

<b>

Sera immediately reacted to my murmured words, peering into my face with a concerned expression.

<b>

"Well, it's not a big deal—no, that's not right, it's actually quite a big deal, so I'm really troubled. It's about what happens after we defeat the S-rank dungeon."

<b>

"Is it about your parents? Lady Idea said she would call them to this world."

<b>

"Well, that's part of it, but I'm also thinking about how to handle the remaining two slots."

<b>

Lady Idea said she would call one person to this world for each S-rank dungeon we conquer. There are a total of six S-rank dungeons.

One slot for Crescent, and one for Hime-Suki—Jade. My parents take up two slots. I currently have no vision for how to handle the remaining two slots.

<b>

"I should probably hear their opinions too."

<b>

As much as possible, I want to bring back my parents, who passed away before me. But Crescent and Jade must have important family members as well.

<b>

"That might be impossible."

<b>

Noah, who had somehow appeared behind me, spoke in a relaxed tone.

When Sera asked, "What do you mean by that?" Noah's expression turned smug.

<b>

"Of course. This 'reward' was prepared for big brother. If it were to fulfill someone else's wishes, I don't think she'd go through the trouble of using a lot of divine power to call someone from a distant world. Lady Idea makes it look easy, but it's an incredible power."

<b>

I see... But doesn't that mean that if I say something clever like, "I wish for Crescent and the others' wishes to be fulfilled," it might work?

As I thought this, Noah seemed to read my mind and answered right away.

<b>

"Well, that would probably be impossible. After all, their parents didn't die in an accident or anything."

<b>

Hmm... Then maybe I should really think about my wishes with the remaining two slots.

There's no time limit, so I want to take my time and come up with the best answer.

<b>

After finishing the guidance for the explorers at the guild, the three of us (though Noah hardly did anything) went sightseeing in the city of Rezel. We strolled around, eating and looking at miscellaneous goods and clothes—just aimlessly wandering the streets.

We walked around the city for about two hours, with one hour spent as a trio and the remaining hour just Sera and me. It seems Noah was being considerate—though she told Sera, "That's one favor owed," so it doesn't seem like it was entirely free.

<b>

In the first place, while we have become close as companions, the fact that she is a deity, even if she was once, makes it seem unnecessary to owe favors.

It might be better to see this as Noah trying to blend in as a human. Even though I already recognize her as a person without needing to do that.

<b>

By the time we returned to the royal castle, the sun had already set.

Crescent and the others had not yet returned from the S-rank dungeon. Well, it takes about four hours for a round trip, and since they are tackling it with the Vinzet siblings, they probably aren't too focused on the shortest route. Still, I think they will return before the date changes.

<b>

With that in mind, I decided it wasn't wise to wait for their return and opted to have dinner with just the members present. However, since it was a meal with the royal family, including Princess Katariya, it wasn't exactly a leisurely time.

<b>

"Could it be that something went wrong...?"

<b>

After finishing our meal and bath, we gathered in a guest room that seemed set up for relaxation, and while we were unwinding, Shiri spoke with a worried tone.

Considering that she isn't a complete Tempest, I can understand her feelings, but—no, it wouldn't be the case with two people in that situation.

<b>

"I understand your concern, but it's fine, it's fine. Shiri and everyone, you know how strong those two are, right?"

<b>

When I said that, Shiri, Phenon, and Sera all nodded. Noah just chuckled softly.

They are probably still wary because it's an S-rank dungeon they haven't encountered yet. They still lack sufficient stats, and when going to an S-rank dungeon, either Noah or I accompany them, so it's understandable.

Crescent and Jade have already obtained all player bonuses and know the full layout of the dungeon, so I have no worries about them.

<b>

"From my and Crescent's perspective—how should I put it... I think it's about the same as what you would feel in an E-rank dungeon or D-rank dungeon. That's how accustomed we are to S-rank dungeons—"

<b>

Just as I was about to say that,

<b>

"We're back!"

<b>

"We successfully conquered it, SR! We took a bit longer because these folks asked for our guidance."

<b>

Crescent and Jade entered the room with bright, shiny smiles.

The Arnold and Jill siblings behind them looked as if they had seen hell, with exhausted expressions.
