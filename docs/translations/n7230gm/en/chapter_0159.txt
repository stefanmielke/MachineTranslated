# A-44 I'm heading straight home

Thank you for your feedback and typo reports, as always!

Thanks to you, the comic has gone to reprint!

<b>

The afterstory has become longer than the author's expectations, and it's starting to feel like "Isn't this basically Part 2...?" But I hope you can continue to enjoy it without worrying about that!

After finishing my speech in the arena, I headed straight to the party house, which also serves as my home.

The sun had already set almost completely, as if I were looking at the top of Regulus's head――ahem. It would soon be dark enough that streetlights would be needed in less than an hour. I was already used to the fact that I had lost track of time while being engrossed in the match.

<b>

I thought for sure that after the speech, I would be held up by His Majesty or Prime Minister Dino, who would say something like, "Let me have a word with you," but when I told the guard stationed at the venue that I was tired and wanted to go home, my request was smoothly accepted. I'm grateful.

<b>

I felt a bit like I was being treated as a delicate item, but that was probably just my imagination. Yeah, just my imagination.

After all, I shouldn't have the image of being someone who gets angry, makes unreasonable demands, or acts tyrannically... probably.

<b>

So, I'm heading home.

However, while His Majesty and the others were probably being considerate of me, the audience wouldn't be so understanding.

If I tried to walk or take a carriage home normally, I would likely be surrounded, especially after that match――in the worst-case scenario, just getting close might scare them. I would like to avoid that for my mental health.

<b>

So, I decided to use my status to traverse the rooftops on my way home. As I wondered if this could be considered illegal trespassing, Noah next to me laughed and said, "In Japan, that would definitely be a no-go."

<b>

"I'm home!"

<b>

After greeting Ray and his subordinates who were on guard outside, I opened the door to my home.

It seems that Fenon and Shiri have been called by my father, and Sera is also busy, so it's just me and Noah for now. It's a bit relaxing in the sense that I don't have to worry about anything.

By the way, it seems that the Trails of Cold Steel characters are deepening their interactions with participants from other countries' martial arts tournaments who visited the arena. It feels more like they're digging into my past than just a reunion.

<b>

"Welcome back, Lord SR."

<b>

As if he had been keeping track of our return time, my father and butler, Shion, gracefully bowed. I wish he would share a bit of that cool and dandy aura with me. However, compared to usual, he seems to have a slightly stiff expression.

Hmm... Shion should have been at home the whole time, but could it be that he already has information about the matches at the arena? That seems plausible for him.

<b>

"Thank you, Shion. The event at the arena went smoothly, so we came back early because we were tired. As for the others... I wonder? They might be caught up in discussions and may not come back here today, so I think it's fine if we just prepare dinner for the two of us for now."

<b>

"Understood. What time shall we prepare dinner?"

<b>

"Uh... what time is it now?"

<b>

"It's just past six in the evening."

<b>

"I see, then let's have it ready by eight. For now, I'll take a bath to wash off the sweat and then relax in my room."

<b>

"Very well. The bath is ready, so you may use it at any time."

<b>

After thanking the capable butler, I moved to my room. It's hard to believe that there isn't a speck of dust in my room without needing to clean, something unimaginable in my previous life. The empty plastic bottle I drank from doesn't sprout legs and walk itself to the trash can; it usually just sits there.

<b>

Upon entering the room, Noah naturally followed me in.

I don't mind, but since she's entering a boy's room, it would be nice if she hesitated a bit, which would help me, a romantic underachiever. No, I guess it's strange to think about romance since she's set up as my sister.

As I sat on the bed, she quietly took a seat on the sofa in the center of the room.

<b>

"I want to hear your thoughts on the match, but you probably want to take a bath first, right? Want to join me? As a special treat, I'll wash your back to show my appreciation for your hard work today."

<b>

"I'll throw you out the window with my gratitude, you brat."

<b>

"That's not gratitude at all! Your actions and feelings are completely opposite!"

<b>

I could almost hear the sound of her pouting as she spoke.

<b>

"I'm just joking, but honestly, having my back washed is a bit embarrassing, so I'll just accept your feelings. Besides, I want to reflect on the match alone in the bath... It's really tough to utilize the position of the Overlord. There are just too many options, and my head is about to explode. If this were a turn-based game, it wouldn't be a problem, but in real-time, it's almost infinite."

<b>

I feel like the match was somewhat chaotic due to being overwhelmed by skills.

While it's certainly fun to be able to use various skills freely, managing them is extremely difficult.

<b>

"Isn't it just a matter of getting used to it? This was your first real battle using the Overlord position, so it's understandable."

<b>

"I hope so... Well, anyway, I messed up with Fenon and the others. I should have at least asked if they were coming over. I'm also debating whether to go to sleep right after eating."

<b>

I had forgotten to discuss those things with Fenon and the others... I hurried home to escape the gazes of others, but as soon as I arrived, all the things I had left undone started flooding my mind.

<b>

"I didn't check what would happen if I entered the arena stage again, and I haven't looked for any signs of regeneration in the barrier at all."

<b>

"Didn't you say while talking to Shin and the others after the match, 'I wonder about the other martial arts tournament participants'?"

<b>

"Ah... I was planning to just take a quick look, but I forgot about that too."

<b>

"I also need to think about how to explain things to His Majesty and the others... I've completely revealed my hand now."

<b>

"I guess I need to consider that too... It's a hassle."

<b>

Really.

I miss the days when I only had to think about clearing dungeons and fighting in Tempest. Of course, I thought about real-life matters a little during the game, but the weight of those issues is different from the current situation where I have to explain myself to someone like a sovereign. It was usually just thoughts like, "I should probably stop sulking" or "I forgot to take out the trash."

<b>

But then, I also have my future marriage with Fenon and Sera to think about.

If a fun future awaits, I can manage this. I’ll gladly take on this kind of hassle.

<b>

And once I can marry Fenon and the others and move freely in ASR――,

<b>

"I think I might go visit dungeons in other countries."

<b>

Like breaking through dojos, but for countries.

Yeah, that would definitely be fun.
