# 32 Discomfort

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Even if you suddenly say something like that... your parents will worry, you know?"

<b>

I had frozen due to the sudden declaration of "I don't want to go home tonight," but as I rebooted, I spoke to Sera in a calming manner.

<b>

Having lived for 33 years, my way of speaking doesn't seem like that of a lively 18-year-old. My feelings are still that of a 20-year-old, though...

<b>

"I can stay out overnight too."

<b>

Sera said with a sulky tone.

<b>

"Even so, this is my house, even if it's within the castle grounds, right? It would be inappropriate for a girl to stay at a single man's house."

<b>

"I don't mind. Besides, with this many rooms, it wouldn't hurt to lend me one, would it?"

<b>

Sure, there are plenty of rooms.

It's no big deal to let someone stay over. But she's a young woman, right? It's different from letting a guy friend like Shin stay over.

<b>

"Even if you don't mind, I do! I won't ask for the reason, but if you don't want to go home, you can just go to an inn in the city."

<b>

There are plenty of inns in the royal capital, so there's no need to stay at a man's house. If she's scared of walking at night, I wouldn't mind escorting her to the inn. It should take about 20 minutes to walk there from here.

<b>

"...I've never used an inn."

<b>

I was taken aback by her unexpected response. I couldn't help but sigh and put my hand on my forehead.

<b>

"...So, does that mean you stay at someone's house?"

<b>

When I asked, she silently pointed to the ground.

With a sulky expression, her gaze was directed at the spot she was pointing to.

<b>

I also looked at the place she indicated.

<b>

...Yeah, the floor.

The texture is elegant, but other than that, it's just ordinary wooden flooring with nothing noteworthy.

<b>

"So... you mean you stayed here?"

<b>

Sera nodded while looking down.

<b>

"I often stayed here with Fenon. It's a story from a few years ago, though."

<b>

Ah... with Fenon, huh? They get along well.

<b>

--That's fine, but Sera must have seen Fenon say to me, "I want to be close to you," so doesn't she think anything about that?

<b>

Staying at the house of a man her best friend likes—I hope it doesn't turn into a messy daytime drama.

<b>

I can't imagine a future where Fenon would say, "You thief cat!" and stab Sera with a knife. It's impossible.

<b>

Well, she seems not to see me as a potential romantic interest, so worrying might be pointless.

<b>

"Does Fenon know about this?"

<b>

I confirmed just to be sure.

Even if Sera is okay with it, Fenon might not be. I don't want to get involved in unnecessary complications.

<b>

"Of course. I consulted Fenon first, and she recommended that I stay here."

<b>

"Really...?"

<b>

What does that mean, Princess...? This world may have a polygamous system, but doesn't she have any possessiveness? Well, it's not something I should worry about. Maybe because she confessed? I tend to overthink about Fenon.

<b>

I covered my entire face with my palm and sighed.

I'm already tired from consecutive meetings, and I don't want to think any more than this. I wish a new brain would fly in from somewhere and replace mine.

<b>

I tried to imagine that situation in my head.

<b>

I realized it would be quite grotesque if it were real.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Toast, milk, fried eggs, salad.

<b>

Even though it's a different world, the breakfast spread on the table is no different from that of a Japanese morning. The sunlight streaming in through the window made the food look even more delicious.

The toast hasn't been sitting out for long—it still has a faint steam rising with the aroma of butter.

<b>

All of this was prepared by Sera early in the morning.

When I woke up later than usual, breakfast was already ready thanks to her. Apparently, since she was allowed to stay over, she wanted to do at least this much.

<b>

Yesterday, we took turns bathing, and I slept in the master bedroom on the second floor while Sera slept in the guest room on the first floor. There was nothing exciting about it.

Not that I was expecting anything at all.

<b>

...I wasn't expecting anything at all!!

<b>

When I made the statement about not wanting to go home, Sera's ears turned red, but it seemed it wasn't due to the embarrassment of staying at a man's house, but rather her selfishness of not wanting to go home. Indeed, depending on how you look at it, she could just be seen as a runaway girl.

<b>

Whether I should be happy that she doesn't see me at all or be sad about it... it's a delicate line.

<b>

Maybe Fenon understood that, which is why she recommended this place.

<b>

By the time I woke up, she was already dressed in casual clothes, ready to go out at any moment. I swallowed the bite of toast in my mouth and spoke to Sera, who was also at the table.

<b>

"Are you going to the dungeon with Fenon again today?"

<b>

"Yeah. She's been nagging me to go to the dungeon with Esuar quickly."

<b>

"Haha... not many people would dare to say 'nagging' to the first princess of the kingdom."

<b>

"Well, if you hang out with Fenon, Esuar will soon start saying the same thing."

<b>

How much of a tomboy is Fenon...?

It's good that she's energetic, but please don't increase my worries any further.

<b>

As I picked at the salad while smiling wryly, Sera spoke up this time.

<b>

"What about Esuar? It seems the meeting with the guild master is over, so are you going to the dungeon?"

<b>

"—Hmm, Shin and the others are coming over today. I just gave them instructions, and that was it. It's more of a progress report."

<b>

"I see... I'm getting left behind more and more."

<b>

"Don't worry about it. I'm having you help raise Fenon's level, and I'll help you raise yours."

<b>

When I said that, she smiled with a troubled expression.

<b>

"I keep relying on you."

<b>

"I'm relying on you too, Sera. It's mutual."

<b>

"Hehe, I hope so. Thank you."

<b>

I replied with "Sure" to Sera, who thanked me, and gulped down the milk. Glancing at her expression, there was indeed something strange about her demeanor.

She had lost much of her vitality compared to the Sera I had gone into the dungeon with a month ago.

<b>

It wasn't just since last night; it had been like this for much longer.

<b>

On the day we celebrated with the Thunderbolt crew, she still seemed lively.

After that, perhaps because we achieved the big goal of "helping the princess," she looked a bit tired... but could it be that it started from that time?

<b>

Was my assumption of her having burnout a misunderstanding, and was there some problem at home? And perhaps that problem worsened, leading her to say she didn't want to go home yesterday.

<b>

Well, it's all just my speculation.

<b>

If she doesn't bring it up, I won't force her to talk. However, if she does come to me for advice, I'll be there to help.

<b>

Even after helping Fenon, Sera has continued to support me and trusts me. That hasn't changed since the day she expressed her determination to me. For someone like me, who has no family, her presence has undoubtedly become my emotional support.

<b>

Whatever stands in Sera's way, if it causes her sadness, I'll confront it. The smile I helped her regain that day, I will definitely protect.

I was a man at the top. I won't allow defeat, not by anyone else, but by myself.

<b>

Well, if it's just a family quarrel, then I probably don't need to intervene.
