# A-51 At the General Store

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing our lunch, we decided to look around the city while heading to our destination, the North Gate of the Royal Capital, as originally planned. According to the four companions accompanying me, this seems to be a date of sorts. If I were to show this scene to my past self, who used to say things like "Real-life couples should explode," I would probably faint.

<b>

Looking at the streets from inside the carriage, the people walking by only glanced our way with a hint of interest, but didn't seem to pay us much mind. It's not like we were adorned with elaborate decorations or had any royal emblems; we probably just looked like possessions of some slightly wealthy individuals.

<b>

"Not having the conveniences of civilization has its pros and cons, huh?"

<b>

I unconsciously muttered that while watching the slowly flowing scenery of the city.

Then, Fenon, who was sitting upright next to me, immediately reacted.

<b>

"By the way, in the world where you were, SR-san, there are vehicles that don't require horses, right? I've heard they don't even need magic stones."

<b>

"Well, even if they say they don't need magic stones, it's just that they use a different fuel, so it's not like fuel is unnecessary. In the place I was, there were vehicles that could fly in the sky and others that ran underground. But in terms of enjoying the scenery, they might not be very good. They go pretty fast."

<b>

In this game's world, there are things that hint at Japanese culture, like food and entertainment, and while they aren't widely spread, there are communication magic tools that serve the role of a telephone. However, there are certainly no things at the level of airplanes or cars. I wish there were at least bicycles to make moving around easier, but unfortunately, I don't really understand the mechanism well enough to teach it. What a pity.

<b>

Fenon let out a sound of admiration, probably imagining the shapes of the vehicles I mentioned in his mind. He must be picturing shapes that I, bound by my fixed notions, couldn't even conceive of.

<b>

"What kind of toys were there? Were there menko or spinning tops?"

<b>

Sera joined in on the conversation between Fenon and me.

By the way, Shiri and Noah are also listening to our talk, but they are in a role of just being listeners.

<b>

"There were some, but... I haven't really played much. I have some experience from when I played at festivals as a child. There were various toys besides menko, and there was so much entertainment that I could play for a lifetime and still not be satisfied."

<b>

Mainly games. If I tried to play all of those—how many lives would it take...? No, it would just mean an endless increase in the things I missed out on. Impossible.

<b>

"Oh, that sounds like every day would be fun."

<b>

"…I wonder about that. Even though it's entertainment, most of it is about competition— the more seriously you get into it, the more frustrating it is when you lose, and you can get irritated when things don't go as you wish. There are times when you might forget the fun in that."

<b>

"But it's just a game, right? Isn't it usually fun whether you win or lose?"

<b>

"Hahaha, it doesn't work that way once you get really into it."

<b>

For me, this world itself is like a form of entertainment.

I never imagined that thanks to the game I played, I would be able to save the world and end up marrying such cute girls... No matter how much I fantasized, I couldn't have imagined that back then.

If someone were to tell me now that all of this was just a dream— I wouldn't just be disappointed; it would be devastating.

<b>

<b>

Just then, I spotted a store that seemed to be selling menko, as mentioned by Sera, and outside the store, boys and girls, likely under ten years old, were slamming their own menko onto a wooden platform. I wished I could have submitted my resignation to the company I was working for back then with that much enthusiasm. I was quite troubled at that time and didn't have the luxury to think about such things.

<b>

Since we still had some time, we got off the carriage a little away from the store to avoid being a nuisance and headed toward the general store selling menko. As we approached, I checked the items inside, and wooden toys were haphazardly arranged. It wasn't that the store was dirty; it had a nice atmosphere that made it easy to pick things up.

<b>

"Welcome... Are you a noble, perhaps?"

<b>

The middle-aged shopkeeper, who had been watching the children's match with warm eyes, noticed us and asked with a slightly anxious expression. It seemed more like he was worried than scared.

<b>

"No, no, we're just ordinary explorers. Is it okay if we take a look around?"

<b>

"—Oh! Is that so! I was surprised because you’re wearing such fine clothes. This is a shop for commoners, so nobles don’t come here, and I’m relieved you’re not too good at polite speech!"

<b>

Saying that, the shopkeeper happily patted my back. Without the benefits of my status, that would have been quite a shock.

As I was thinking about that and smiling wryly, the shopkeeper turned his face toward each of us.

<b>

"By the way, this is the first time I've seen faces like yours. Most of the higher-level explorers in the Royal Capital are usually familiar with each other... Did you just come to the Royal Capital recently?"

<b>

When he said "higher-level," it was probably because our clothes were relatively expensive. Also, I think he figured out that I had a decent status from my reaction when he patted me.

This shopkeeper himself is likely a current or former explorer, or perhaps he has someone close to him who is a higher-level explorer.

<b>

"Ah, we came from Lindale."

<b>

"Oh! Is that so! Speaking of which, I've heard that the 'strongest explorer' from Lindale and their companions have come to this country! Well, I guess you would know that in your home country, haha! My daughter went to see that match, and she talked all night about how 'this part was amazing' and 'it looked fun.'"

<b>

The shopkeeper shrugged his shoulders but seemed to be enjoying the conversation a bit.

Me? Of course, I’m frozen with a smile. While it's nice to be praised like that, it’s undeniably a bit embarrassing.

Besides, the foreign people invited to that match must have been somewhat limited... What could this mean?

<b>

"Hey, you guys should also work hard to aim for ASR's SR! It's a good thing to have your goal nearby! After all, my daughter grew up aiming for my back!"

<b>

Laughing heartily, the shopkeeper patted my back once more. We're practically at a level of being one with each other in terms of distance.

Since both I and my companions were starting to feel a bit awkward, I decided to steer the conversation in another direction and asked something that piqued my interest.

<b>

"Is your daughter perhaps a member of the 'Crimson Blade'? I thought there were pretty strict admission limits for that match."

<b>

"Oh, you know about my daughter? Wow, she’s become quite famous. I’m proud as a parent."

<b>

Nodding with his arms crossed, the shopkeeper looked pleased.

He seemed as happy as if he were being praised for himself. I wonder if I would feel that way if I had children? I can't really imagine it.

<b>

As I was thinking about such things, I heard a light sound of footsteps coming down the stairs from the back of the store, tap-tap-tap. Then the door behind the counter swung open energetically, and who appeared was—

<b>

"Hey, Daddy! I think I’ll go in this gear tomorrow, but does it look weird? —Oh, customers are here…………… huh?"

<b>

It was Neska, whom I had just met a moment ago.
