# A-10 Yoshi Yoshi

<b>

(From the author's perspective) It's a super cute episode.

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

We stormed the hideout of the pickpocket gang and successfully captured all the criminals without even a scratch.

We—though it's just me and Noah acting as lookouts—are not the real heroes of this mission; it's the three of them: Sera, Phenon, and Shiri.

<b>

However, what we were requested to do was merely to mediate a fight, and the capture of the pickpockets wasn't something anyone specifically asked us to do.

<b>

As for me, I'd be fine with just getting some coffee or snacks as a special bonus, but there’s the first princess among the ASR members… Even though we’re operating as an explorer party, if Phenon shines, it feels like it could lead to some troublesome situations.

<b>

Regarding the reward, we’ll be informed through Regulus, the guild master of the royal capital, as soon as the details are clear, but honestly, just thinking about it is a hassle.

Isn't it fine to say that the knights took care of it? We need to hear Sera and the others' opinions too, but I think they probably feel the same way as I do.

<b>

That aside.

<b>

After asking the knights to handle the aftermath, I walked to a nearby, less crowded area, and there I was met with the trembling head of the person who had captured the most criminals.

<b>

The other two had sulky expressions, and Noah was giving me a side-eye.

Why am I the one being looked at like I’m to blame? That disgruntled gaze should be directed at the victor, not me.

<b>

“For now, I’m glad everyone is unhurt.”

<b>

After surveying everyone, I offered some words of encouragement and took a step towards the victor.

I haven’t really patted anyone’s head before. My romantic experience on Earth is far too lacking, which is sad.

<b>

“...Is this, um, okay?”

<b>

I thought about how it might not be good to mess up her hair—while I gently placed my hand on Shiri's head, recalling the sensation from when I used to pet the neighborhood dog, and slowly began to stroke her head.

<b>

Then,

<b>

“Y-yes! This is a perfect Yoshi Yoshi with no flaws! I do wonder if it’s appropriate for a mere maid like me to receive such a reward from you, SR-san, but I thought it would be rude to forfeit my rights as the victor, and I didn’t take the targets of Sera-san and Phenon-sama just to be petted, it was truly just a coincidence!”

<b>

O-oh… I can’t understand what she’s saying because she’s speaking too fast.

She doesn’t seem to be unhappy, but is this really how Shiri is?

<b>

“I do feel a bit sorry for the two of you who are mutually in love, but this is a competition, so you’ll have to accept it! I won! I worked hard to capture a lot! So this is my rightful—no, it’s almost a duty! And you have the right to pet my head, SR-san! Congratulations!”

<b>

I barely caught the words “duty” and “right to pet,” but her speed of speech is terrifyingly fast and I can’t keep up.

Like me, Sera was watching Shiri with a wry smile.

<b>

And then there’s Phenon.

<b>

“I’ve never seen Shiri this flustered before… Has she lost her screws?”

<b>

She said something very rude.

As someone who has likely spent the most time with Shiri, she was staring at her maid with wide eyes.

I also had a relatively serious image of Shiri as a “capable person” or “strong-willed woman,” so I was honestly surprised by this change. Perhaps Phenon had a similar impression of her.

<b>

Somehow, it felt like I developed a closer bond with Shiri in that moment.

<b>

“Well, it seems impossible to get closer.”

<b>

The parade’s start time had arrived, and a loud cheer that shook the ground echoed throughout the city. Although we were still a bit far from the starting point at the royal castle, the population density made it seem impossible to get any closer.

<b>

“Should we force our way in?”

<b>

“That’s not possible. If we charged in now, there would definitely be injuries.”

<b>

How much of a status difference do you think there is between us and regular folks? Just bumping into them would send the residents flying.

<b>

“Then should I remove my disguise? I’m sure everyone will clear the way for us.”

<b>

“No way! That would cause a commotion and ruin the parade!”

<b>

While it might be possible to take a leisurely look, we would also be exposed to the gazes of those around us. It would be hard to tell who the spectators were.

<b>

But what to do?

<b>

Since we were waiting in the royal capital for the Thunderbolt’s return after a long time, it would be a bit lonely to enjoy the festival without even meeting Renus.

<b>

“Why don’t we just wait at the royal castle for them to come back? With Phenon here, it should be fine, right?”

<b>

I see.

In that case, it does seem like we could talk to the Thunderbolt members.

<b>

“However, we don’t really have any business at the royal castle… If we do that, we won’t be able to see how Shin and the others are doing.”

<b>

I’m curious about how those guys are behaving in public right now. If they’re just happily enjoying themselves, that’s fine, but if they’re getting carried away after winning the world championship, I’ll need to impose some stricter training on them to keep them from slacking off as their mentor.

<b>

I want them to grow as my rivals.

<b>

“How about watching from inside a building? We might not be able to talk, but we can see the parade without getting caught up in the crowd.”

<b>

“That’s true.”

<b>

As Shiri said, it would be best if we could watch from the second or third floor of a building.

However, it’s not just us who would be thinking of that. It’s easy to predict that the buildings along the parade route are already filled with spectators.

<b>

It would be impossible for regular folks to enter—and it would be great if there were someone responsible who could make an exception for us, and if there were a reasonably large building in the royal capital…

<b>

“...Oh?”

<b>

I suddenly remembered a building that perfectly fit those conditions. I stopped in my tracks and slammed my fist into my palm.

<b>

Sera, Phenon, and Shiri tilted their heads at my sudden action. And Noah quickly agreed with my idea, saying, “That’s the best place.”

<b>

“There’s the Explorer Guild! That hagg—Regulus-san should be able to clear a room for us somehow.”

<b>

He’s the guild master of the royal capital, with whom I’ve had a relationship since before the collapse.

He should be able to accommodate some requests, and even if it’s difficult, he might come up with an alternative plan.

<b>

We haven’t received any reward for capturing the pickpockets yet, so he should help us out.
