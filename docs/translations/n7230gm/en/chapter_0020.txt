# 19 You're My Mom

<b>

<b>

<b>

After changing jobs, Jinrai no Kiseki and Sera-san immediately went to dive into a D-rank dungeon. They needed to spend a full seven days, including today, leveling up in the dungeon and earning status bonuses.

<b>

Even when I informed them of the hard schedule, no one showed any signs of displeasure, and they happily headed to the D-rank dungeon with the 'No Status Check' sealed letter prepared by Regulus-san.

Sera-san said, "Leave this to us," but behind her, Jinrai no Kiseki was smiling wryly. That’s understandable. Sera-san has the lowest level after all.

<b>

I also needed to raise my martial artist level to 30 and increase my STR as much as possible. Otherwise, I would end up lamenting my lack of VIT in a long battle.

Having made a bold declaration, I couldn't afford to show a pathetic appearance, so I decided to devote myself to leveling up.

<b>

In terms of efficiency, it should be faster to defeat monsters in a C-rank dungeon than to tackle B-rank dungeon monsters.

<b>

"---Let's give it our all."

<b>

I was set to meet them again at the Explorer's Guild in seven days.

I really hope they do their best to help the princess—meaning, to conserve my stamina.

<b>

As I left the guild, I slapped my cheeks to wake myself up and get motivated.

It doesn't matter if I'm tired or if time is running out. I really do like this world, which feels like a game with leveling up, status, and experience points.

My face naturally broke into a smile as I headed toward the dungeon.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"---I made it!"

<b>

The day before the promised day, it was just past 5 PM.

I had just broken through the fourth layer of the C-rank dungeon and finally reached my long-awaited level 30.

The remaining five layers and the boss? I don't care about those. I'm heading back. No matter how much I like leveling up, there are limits.

<b>

No matter how hard I try now, reaching level 40 by tomorrow is impossible, and if I can't reach 40, there's no need to push myself right now.

<b>

Initially, I had planned to reach level 30 in a total of seven days—meaning, I thought I could do it in five days since I talked to Jinrai no Kiseki.

However, it seemed I was more fatigued than I expected, and my body was sluggish, taking longer to progress.

I had set it to seven days to match them, but it turned out I was the one who needed the full seven days.

<b>

After exiting the dungeon, I staggered toward the inn in the royal capital.

The receptionist and other explorers expressed concern, saying I looked pale, but I replied, "I'll be fine after some sleep," and left. That was indeed true.

<b>

"By the way, did Sera-san and the others manage to reach level 30...?"

<b>

I had told them where the inn was, so they should contact me if anything happened. The lack of contact likely meant they had successfully leveled up without any issues.

<b>

As a substitute for an energy drink, I downed an intermediate potion dropped in the C-rank dungeon. Since it was a healing potion, it only served as a temporary relief.

The taste was neither good nor bad. It tasted like water with a hint of herbs and a medicinal flavor. It had a slight sweetness, but those who dislike it might find it unpalatable.

<b>

"Just as they believed in me, I have to believe in them as well. Yes, there's no doubt about it. So, I want to sleep quickly."

<b>

Perhaps due to lack of sleep, I was in a strange mood, muttering more to myself than usual as I returned to the inn with unsteady steps.

<b>

<b>

As soon as I returned to the inn, I dove into bed and slept straight through until 8 AM the next morning. If asked whether I had fully recovered, I would have to answer no.

The accumulated fatigue and sleep deprivation could not be resolved with just 14 hours of sleep.

<b>

"Hmm... still not enough sleep."

<b>

I yawned widely on the bed and turned over. Lying face down, I shouted into my pillow, "Ufohifuhafuhai (I don't want to move)," when there was a knock on the door.

<b>

"Esuar, can I come in?"

<b>

The voice belonged to Sera-san.

I sat up from bed, tidied myself up a bit, and replied, "Please come in."

<b>

"I can't let you oversleep today. I'm here to pick you up."

<b>

She entered the room with a grin.

It's true that I have a history of oversleeping. It's understandable for her to worry.

And her judgment was not wrong. If I let my guard down, I might forget everything and fall back asleep.

<b>

"Thank you for your concern... We're meeting at 9, right?"

<b>

I could still sleep for another 30 minutes, right?

<b>

"Yeah. There's no way we can enter a dungeon right after waking up, right? You need to wake up by now."

<b>

"You're right."

<b>

Alright, I get it, I'm getting up.

Are you my mom or something?

<b>

<b>

After washing my face and having breakfast in the dining room on the first floor of the inn, I listened to Sera-san talk. The content was, of course, about the past seven days.

<b>

"So everyone managed to level up to 30."

<b>

"Yeah. The members of Jinrai no Kiseki were half in doubt about the status bonuses before entering the dungeon, but after defeating monsters without any issues, they seemed to have confirmed that what Esuar said was true. After that, it was a whirlwind of monster hunting. Of course, I believed what you said was true from the start."

<b>

With a proud smile, Sera-san said this.

Then she continued her story.

<b>

"I reached level 30 the day before yesterday, and yesterday I spent the whole day reverting my job and confirming our coordination in the C-rank dungeon. Unlike Jinrai no Kiseki, I'm a solo explorer like you, Esuar."

<b>

"I see. So Sera-san finally conquered the C-rank dungeon."

<b>

"Of course. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to enter a B-rank dungeon, would I? It wouldn't be a laughing matter if I were left behind when heading to the battlefield."

<b>

"Haha, I would have liked to see that."

<b>

"That's cruel."

<b>

Even as she said that, Sera-san's face was smiling.

However, perhaps due to the tension for the upcoming battle, there was a slight stiffness visible.

When we conquer the dungeon and save the princess's life, I wonder what kind of smile she will have?

Another purpose for conquering the B-rank dungeon has been added.

<b>

<b>

After finishing breakfast, we left the inn to make it in time for our meeting.

When we arrived at the Explorer's Guild, we found Regulus-san pacing nervously near the reception area. I approached him and spoke.

<b>

"Good morning. Are the members of Jinrai no Kiseki here?"

<b>

"Ah, you made it on time. They're at a table in the tavern."

<b>

Regulus-san indicated the location with his gaze and chin. When I turned my face in that direction, Shin-san raised his hand while holding a mug.

<b>

"I can't believe it, but you guys aren't drinking alcohol, right...?"

<b>

"They're not that foolish. They're drinking water."

<b>

"Why with mugs...?"

<b>

"Who knows? Maybe they're just trying to get pumped up?"

<b>

Does drinking water from a mug really motivate someone? At least I would prefer to drink from a cup.

<b>

Shin-san, Suzu-san, and Raika-san stood up from their chairs and approached us. I greeted them with, "Good morning."

<b>

"Good morning. Did you sleep well?"

<b>

"Good morning."

<b>

"Good morning. So Sera-san was with you."

<b>

The three of them replied, and Sera-san and I responded that we had indeed slept well—or that Esuar might oversleep, etc.

<b>

While I think communication is important, we don't have time to chat for long.

<b>

"Now, let's head to the dungeon right away. Are your equipment and potions ready?"

<b>

"Yeah. How many years do you think we've been explorers? What about you? Your weapon is in your inventory, but that outfit can't be called armor."

<b>

"I'm fine. Poor armor only hinders movement, so it's actually counterproductive."

<b>

There are no issues with my weapon either.

<b>

Actually, before conquering the C-rank dungeon, I had bought a steel sword at the town's weapon shop, intending to use it for the challenge. However, I got a slightly better sword dropped from the boss of the C-rank dungeon.

I don't know if it was a drop that existed since the game era or something unique to this world. I can't remember all the small drops.

<b>

That sword is named "Kuroto," which fits its appearance, and its blade length is just under a meter. It's light and has decent sharpness.

It's a slight boost in power, but better than nothing.

<b>

"Don't push yourself too hard."

<b>

Regulus-san looked at each of us and said that.

He genuinely cares about us explorers, regardless of status—just like he does for the princess.

Having a person like him as a boss must make work enjoyable. Compared to my boss back on Earth, the difference is like that between a dragon and a slime.

What a fantastical metaphor.

<b>

"Yeah. I'm off."

<b>

Sera-san said that and then turned, leaving the Explorer's Guild with a flourish. I followed along with Jinrai no Kiseki. As we walked, I made eye contact with Shin-san, who tilted his head.

<b>

"I'm the leader of the country's top party... so why is Sera leading us?"

<b>

"Let’s not point that out; it would be cruel, so let's just let it slide."

<b>

We all shrugged and smiled wryly. Sera-san, walking energetically with her arms swinging, looked like a child playing at adventure.
