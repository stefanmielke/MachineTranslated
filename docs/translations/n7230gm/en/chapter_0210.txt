# A-93 Strolling Date

<b>

About Crescent and Jade's new home.

Since the idea of building it near my house came up, I consulted with the party members.

<b>

That said, just because we refused doesn't mean I own the entire property, and if they insist on going ahead, I have no right to stop them.

<b>

In the end, neither Sera nor Pheno, nor Shiri or Noah opposed it; rather, they seemed to be wondering, "Why are you asking about that?" It seems I was just worrying too much.

Today, Crescent, Jade, Sera, and I had come to the city of Renus.

The two from my hometown were eager to get started, so they were planning to order a new house right away.

Currently, they have almost no money, but well, those two should be able to earn it without any problems.

<b>

"It's been a while since we've walked together like this."

<b>

While Crescent was talking with the contractor, Sera and I were wandering around the city.

Since we didn't have any particular plans, we were just aimlessly strolling around.

As a commercial city, Renus has no shortage of shops to see.

Crescent and Jade had been busy coming and going lately, and aside from that, I had mostly been diving into dungeons. It's nice to have a break like this once in a while.

And being just the two of us is also nice. Even though everyone is close, having four or five people around can be a bit tiring.

<b>

"Is there anywhere you want to go, Esuar?"

<b>

"Well... not particularly, so I was thinking of just going into whatever catches my eye. How about you, Sera?"

<b>

"I don't have anything in mind either. Then let's just take a leisurely stroll."

<b>

With that, Sera shyly took my hand.

The first time was a light grip, then she squeezed it tightly. Finally, it escalated to a lover's hold, fingers intertwined. This all happened in just three seconds.

Even though we're already married, I wonder what this freshness is.

Of course, I shouldn't laugh because if I tried to hold Sera's hand, it might end up the same way, but I couldn't help but chuckle.

<b>

"W-What's so funny!"

<b>

"I just think it's cute."

<b>

"D-Don't say it so clearly..."

<b>

Her face turned red, and Sera looked down. The people around us smiled at her, seemingly saying, "Oh dear, how sweet."

<b>

We entered various shops—clothing stores, food places, weapon shops—adopting a spirit of trying out whatever caught our attention, and enjoyed the city of Renus.

It's been quite a while since I started living near Renus, but there are still many shops I don't know. This city is that big, and I haven't been around much because I've been going to dungeons too often.

Living a dungeon-centric life isn't bad, but I need to cherish days like this too.

<b>

It's different from when I was single.

I have a family and comrades now. My body is no longer just mine alone.

I should have realized this when I bonded with Sera and Pheno, but walking around the city makes me aware of how much I've neglected that part.

<b>

"From now on, maybe I should increase these kinds of moments."

<b>

As I muttered this in a shop, Sera chuckled softly.

<b>

"What, is my husband thinking about us?"

<b>

With a teasing smile, Sera came closer. In her hand was a lion dance-like doll. I wonder if she's planning to buy it.

Well, that aside.

<b>

"Of course I think about it. If possible, it would be better if everyone is happy, right?"

<b>

Sera, Pheno, Shiri, and Noah.

And recently, Crescent and Jade too.

I want everyone to be happy. I want everyone to be smiling.

Whether that's possible or not aside, isn't it natural to wish for that?

<b>

"You're kind, Esuar."

<b>

I wonder if that's true. As I pondered this, I listened to Sera's words.

<b>

"But that doesn't mean you have to hold back, Esuar. While it's certainly fun to stroll around the city like this, I, like you, also enjoy dungeon exploration just as much."

<b>

Of course, I'm enjoying this time too.

It's just that the action of "going to the dungeon" is so ingrained in me that before I know it, my feet are heading toward the dungeon. It's completely addictive.

<b>

If, in the future, I were to have children with Sera and Pheno—there's no way I could go to the dungeon every day.

I need to keep in mind to gradually reduce the frequency of exploration as a sort of rehearsal.

As I was thinking about that, Sera, still holding the lion dance doll, seemed hesitant to say something and finally said, "A-Also..."

<b>

"Whether in a dungeon or in the city, I would be happy if we could have moments like this just the two of us sometimes..."

<b>

I chuckled and said, "That's cute," and she blushed as she headed to pay for the lion dance doll.

I never thought she would actually buy it... I need to understand her preferences better.
