# 103 The Final Battle Begins

<b>

<b>

<b>

Noah unleashes the seal of Venom, and the battle that will determine the fate of this world finally begins.

It feels both long and short... setting aside that strange sensation, I must be cautious of the enemy's attacks that come right after the opening. It would be foolish to lose in one hit after coming this far.

<b>

"Then I'll make myself invisible; let me know when you're ready."

<b>

"Got it."

<b>

In battle, what Noah does is protect my recovery and the non-soul aspects from Venom's destruction. In other words, it would be meaningless for him to stay here.

As someone who specializes in solo combat, I honestly find it easier to fight without anyone around, so I'd prefer Noah to disappear. It wouldn't matter in terms of spectators, but there's no need to waste energy on that.

<b>

"Fuuuu..."

<b>

I take a deep breath and exhale strongly.

<b>

Then I stretch my arms, shoulders, and legs—my entire body.

I don't feel any stiffness, but this has become a routine born from my ongoing challenges against Venom.

Without conscious thought, my brain automatically switches to combat mode.

<b>

"Alright, let's do this."

<b>

Finally, I tilt my neck from side to side and swing the white lotus I hold into the void.

<b>

The few years I've lived in this world created by Noah are far richer than the decades spent on Earth. Sadly, more than half of that time was spent living alone with Noah, and my heart was shattered by the loss of my companions.

<b>

Still, I love this world—this level, these skills, this profession, and the monsters in this fantastical world.

The job of an explorer, fraught with the danger of death, gives me a thrill that I could never experience on Earth.

<b>

"I'll definitely save you."

<b>

After gazing at the carved necklace of Yukarimusubi hanging from my neck for a few seconds, I put it away in my inventory to avoid hindering the battle.

<b>

Reunion with Phenon.

<b>

Reunion with Sera.

<b>

I want to see and talk to them again, along with Regulus and the other people from this world.

<b>

Once I start thinking, there's no end to it. Memories from my time in this world flash through my mind like a revolving lantern. The expressions when we first met, the surprise party, the times we delved into dungeons, and the last time we saw each other.

<b>

"I'm not going to die or anything."

<b>

I've heard from Noah that Venom's movements might have changed.

Of course, it's only natural since it's not operating on a system like a game. I should expect it to be somewhat stronger.

<b>

"Noah, good to go."

<b>

Not knowing where he is, I call out to the sky.

Immediately, I receive a short reply, "Understood," that resonates directly in my mind.

I can tell from the tone of her voice that she is tense, likely because we've spent so much time together.

<b>

Standing still, I fix my gaze directly on Venom, who is about twenty meters away from me.

<b>

The glass-like seal, just like when Laika and Sera disappeared, becomes thin and vanishes. During this process, Venom's enormous eyelids slowly lift.

<b>

White eyeballs with black pupils. Blood vessels as thick as iron pipes run irregularly like lightning.

<b>

When Venom's eyes are fully opened—before it completely disappears, the seal shatters with a high-pitched sound like breaking glass.

<b>

"Long time no see."

<b>

I spoke in a tone as if addressing a friend without thinking. Of course, Venom, with no ears or mouth and only eyeballs, wouldn't respond. It moves its eyes around, scanning the surroundings.

<b>

From directly beneath Venom's body, seven thick, meaty spikes, at least a meter in diameter, sprout. These are like legs for it, and they don't move but merely support its weight—at least, that's how it should be.

I can't help but wonder what the volume of your body is—it's a change that makes me want to comment.

<b>

With those legs lifting its body about five meters, Venom's gaze, which had been wandering in the air, turned towards me.

<b>

Then suddenly, without any warning—my body and the ground physically sink. The floor shatters, and I feel a massive amount of water crushing my body.

Venom continues to use gravity magic without any motion or time delay. It's unfair since it takes me time to activate mine.

<b>

Unaware of my feelings of jealousy, Venom unleashes a purple light from its eyes without hesitation. It feels like a one-meter-wide hammer is coming at me.

<b>

"—Is this also as per the game? Noah has made it quite faithful."

<b>

Relying on my trained stats and the body enhancement skill of a sage, I forcibly jump sideways to escape the gravity magic, narrowly avoiding the light.

<b>

If I were to be hit by this light, any player would have to use an elixir. This purple light is a petrification spell, and if I get hit in the wrong spot, it could lead to an instant game over.

<b>

Even if this light grazes my body, and I could recover from petrification with an elixir, once an elixir is used, it can't be used again for the next hour. Therefore, I must avoid this opening petrification spell at all costs.

That said, I'm really glad it didn't turn into some unreasonable magic with a one-kilometer diameter.

<b>

Having its attack evaded, Venom immediately wraps its eyeball in a bluish-white barrier. This seven-layered barrier is directly unassailable. Any gamer would intuitively realize that to attack the main body, the legs must first be destroyed.

<b>

Now then, shall I make my move as well?

<b>

"Make sure the white lotus doesn't get destroyed."

<b>

I mutter towards Noah, who is likely watching from somewhere, and I dash towards Venom. I must first deal with these seven thick legs that have extremely high regeneration abilities.

<b>

If it's like the game, there should be no attacks from the eyeball itself, and the seven legs will each attack using different methods.

While the legs remain stationary, they can use magic and extend their tentacles, doing whatever they please. However, for me, a situation with multiple opponents is something I'm already used to and can even say is my specialty.

<b>

Countless tentacles rush towards me as I get closer. Each tentacle seems to have a will of its own, accurately targeting vital spots like my head, throat, and heart. I evade them as usual, with minimal movement.

<b>

Then, as I get even closer, I dodge the fire and earth projectile magic shot from the legs while spinning my body, and with that momentum, I deliver my first strike—a blow from the white lotus.

<b>

"If there's no worry about stamina, shall I take them down one by one carefully?"

<b>

The leg of Venom that I slashed—though the wound is shallow, it is clearly illuminated by the white, faint light from the white lotus.
