# A-36 Challenger

<b>

<b>

The black "Moon" that appeared in the arena.

As it took a step back, releasing its hand from what seemed to be a shimmering, transparent barrier of seven colors, it vanished as if melting into the air.

<b>

"Surely, they didn't come in person."

<b>

There was no sign of movement, nor any atmosphere of living beings.

That means, it must be a copy prepared by Lady Idea. Given that it appeared after conquering an S-rank dungeon, one can assume this is a substitute for an SS-rank dungeon.

Compared to Venom, the difficulty has suddenly spiked to the point of being laughable... haha.

<b>

"W-who just appeared in the arena!?"

<b>

One of the knights rushed over in a flustered manner, alternating his gaze between my face and the now-empty arena.

<b>

"Most likely, those black figures correspond to the boss of an SS-rank dungeon."

<b>

"That's ridiculous!? Is this really a dungeon!? And an SS-rank one at that!?"

<b>

No, really. If I were in the knights' position, I would have laughed it off as "no way."

It might even be inappropriate to call this a dungeon, but my mediocre mind can't immediately come up with a suitable term. That's the strongest party I encountered while playing the same game in my previous life—of course, I can't say that.

<b>

Perhaps, this is a special enemy prepared by Lady Idea just for me. I don't even know if I can challenge it repeatedly like a normal dungeon. It's possible that defeating it would lead to its immediate disappearance.

<b>

"Lady Idea really has summoned an outrageous enemy."

<b>

Noah quietly came beside me and spoke in a small voice.

I'm not sure if she saw it while monitoring me on Earth or if she read my thoughts, but it seems she has realized the true identity of the enemy before us.

<b>

"There's nothing impossible for Esuar! No matter the enemy, it won't be a problem!"

<b>

And right behind Noah, Sera proudly declared.

In response, the knight reacted with sparkling eyes, saying things like "impressive" and "amazing." It's a bit embarrassing to hear that up close, so I would prefer if they held back.

<b>

"Haha... I'll do my best to meet your expectations."

<b>

If I were to die in front of everyone, it would definitely become a trauma.

When I challenge, it might be better to have the arena off-limits.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Phew... Seeing the "Moon" appear in the arena was quite an interesting sight.

<b>

Well, let's go home.

<b>

<b>

—But that wasn't possible, as I was led by the knights to the royal castle for the original purpose. To put it mildly, it was incredibly troublesome. I just wanted to think about dungeons...

<b>

In the audience chamber, I received words of praise from His Majesty Xenon.

I can't be bothered with becoming a noble and managing a territory! I want to live in dungeons! This stance should have been conveyed by Phenon, so His Majesty didn't attempt to grant me a title.

<b>

As expected, it seems I will be awarded a title, but they are currently deliberating on its name. Is it really something to ponder over that much?

I thought it would have been decided long ago since the kings had plenty of time to think about it.

<b>

However, about an hour after the audience.

I learned the reason for their deliberation over the title.

<b>

<b>

"There was a divine oracle."

<b>

"Buh—A, an oracle?"

<b>

Upon hearing the words from His Majesty Xenon, who was seated on the opposite sofa, I almost spat out the tea I had just sipped. A few drops that leaked from my mouth fell onto the table, and Shiri quickly wiped it with a handkerchief.

<b>

Currently, in the reception room of the royal castle, there are members of ASR, King Xenon, Prime Minister Dino, and two royal guards, totaling nine people.

After a preface stating that this gathering is unofficial, His Majesty said that with a serious expression.

<b>

Looking to the left at Sera, beyond her—when I directed my gaze to Noah, she shook her head vigorously. Hmm, it seems she is not involved in this matter. That leaves Lady Idea as the one who delivered the oracle by process of elimination...

<b>

For now, I think I'll ask about anything that piques my interest.

<b>

"Was that oracle directed at Your Majesty? And what is the name of the deity?"

<b>

"It was directed at me. Others may have received oracles as well, but so far, there is no information on that. Of course, the one who delivered the oracle is the Creator God, Lady Idea."

<b>

It seems Lady Idea has completely taken over this world.

When I eventually return it to Noah, I suppose she will change the name of the deity.

<b>

"The fact that you're discussing this here means it concerns us, right?"

<b>

"Indeed. You have good intuition. This is a matter concerning ASR—or rather, you."

<b>

Oh... However, if it concerns me, Lady Idea could just tell me directly. Why go through the trouble of conveying it via the king?

<b>

"So, what is the content of the oracle?"

<b>

As I asked, His Majesty's expression turned grave in an instant. He then took a deep breath.

<b>

And,

<b>

"Now, let me convey an excerpt of the oracle—'In the arena, let the conqueror of the S-rank dungeon, Esuar, face the enemy I have prepared. As spectators, nobles and as many commoners as possible should be arranged'—it seems that even if others clear the S-rank dungeon, they cannot participate."

<b>

He said such a thing.

Well, fighting alone was within the realm of expectations—rather, I had no intention of letting Sera and Phenon fight those guys. Even if it were possible, I would do everything in my power to stop them. They would seriously die.

More importantly,

<b>

"Spectators, huh..."

<b>

That's the bigger issue.

Of course, I have no intention of losing. I have the job of a conqueror, and I plan to win no matter what.

<b>

However, there is always a possibility.

<b>

Since there are several important people in this world, I have emergency return in mind for when the time comes, but I can't do something so uncool in front of many people, and running away is not in my nature. It's troublesome.

<b>

"Are you not worried about facing this alone?"

<b>

Dino, who was standing beside His Majesty, seemed to want to say, "Aren't you more worried about the spectators!" He asked. Before I could answer that fighting alone was not a problem, the women beside me spoke up.

<b>

"Hehe, Esuar's true worth is revealed when he's alone!"

<b>

"Indeed! It will be a battle like that of a demon! Even if I were to accompany you, unfortunately, I would only be a hindrance."

<b>

They confidently declared as if it were their own situation. It's a bit embarrassing.

<b>

"Um... well, that's about right. They have improved their skills, but... as per Lady Idea's oracle, I will fight alone."

<b>

Perhaps, Lady Idea prepared this scenario for my elevation in status—so that I would be recognized as the fiancé of the two women around me. It's incredibly difficult, but I suppose I have no choice.

I never expected to become a challenger again in this world... it's truly a joyful thought.
