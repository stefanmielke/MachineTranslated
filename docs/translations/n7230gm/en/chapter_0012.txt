# 11 I Dislike You

<b>

<b>

<b>

It has been three days since Sera-san became my bodyguard.

<b>

<b>

On the first day, we conquered an E-rank dungeon and then made rounds in a D-rank dungeon.

On the second day, from morning till night, we continued to make rounds in the D-rank dungeon, raising the swordsman's level to 30.

<b>

The change that came with leveling up was that I learned a skill upon reaching level 25.

It’s called presence detection.

This is a so-called sixth sense-type passive skill that allows me to sense the positions of people and monsters without relying on sight or sound.

<b>

It's difficult to explain in words.

<b>

However, having this skill makes a significant difference in the speed of dungeon exploration. If I change to another primary class, I won't be able to use the skill, though.

<b>

Next, when I touched the profession section of my status, I was able to select the swordsman. It seems that people in this world tend to change to secondary classes—advanced classes—early on. Naturally, I wouldn’t do something so inefficient.

<b>

Finally, the main objective of leveling up—acquiring player bonuses.

<b>

Of course, even when looking at the status window, there’s no indication of that. As a final confirmation, I need to change to a brawler now and check if the swordsman's player bonus is indeed effective.

<b>

"Where can I buy a job change orb?"

<b>

At 9 AM. Just like yesterday, I met up with Sera-san, who was waiting outside the inn, and we headed towards the D-rank dungeon.

<b>

"What do you need it for?"

<b>

"Well, I need it for changing jobs. There’s no other use for it, right?"

<b>

Upon hearing my words, Sera-san made a displeased expression—but she still seemed somewhat lacking in spirit. Ever since I reported the conquest of the D-rank dungeon, she had been acting this way.

<b>

"I didn't ask for that reason. You were supposed to be leveling up as a swordsman. What do you plan to do by changing to another profession now?"

<b>

She questioned me with a dissatisfied expression.

This world—such a question comes from ignorance.

<b>

That said, I myself haven’t actually confirmed anything about the player bonuses yet. I’ll just gloss over it.

<b>

"It’s just a little change of pace. It gets boring just being a swordsman."

<b>

"…Hah. Just do as you please. I’ll give you the orb I have. I have plenty of them anyway, and they’re just gathering dust."

<b>

Job change orbs are random drops from E-rank dungeons.

Unfortunately, when I conquered the E-rank dungeon, there were no orbs dropped.

It’s a hassle to go buy one, so if Sera-san is offering, I’ll accept it.

<b>

"I want orbs for brawler, knight, archer, and priest—four in total. Is 10,000 orl okay?"

<b>

In the game, job change orbs were traded for 2,000 orl each. This time, I don’t need the other primary class, 'mage,' so I’ll take four. Normally, that would be 8,000 orl, but I added a little extra.

<b>

"…Are you stupid? Why would you pay such a large sum for this useless item?"

<b>

Come to think of it, do people in this world not change jobs often? Is the price low because there’s no demand?

<b>

"Well, I can’t just take it for free."

<b>

"Hmph—if you’re not satisfied, then I’ll sell it for the market price. One orb for 100 orl."

<b>

"100 orl!? Is it really that cheap!?"

<b>

"It’s actually rare to find a buyer even at 100 orl."

<b>

I handed 400 orl to the still unenthusiastic Sera-san and received the four orbs.

<b>

I put the orbs for all but the brawler into my inventory and opened the status screen.

When I touched the profession section, the words 'brawler' appeared alongside 'swordsman.'

Alright, alright. I opened the status while still holding the orb—just like in the game.

<b>

"—W-Wait a minute. I feel like I just saw the word 'swordsman.'"

<b>

It’s considered bad manners to look at someone else’s status.

In this world, the status displays age as well, and due to safety concerns, there seems to be an unspoken rule against looking at others' statuses.

<b>

Currently, Sera-san is facing the opposite direction from me, making sure not to look at my status. I opened my status without worrying about being seen, so I don’t intend to blame her.

<b>

"It’s fine if you look."

<b>

When I said that, she replied, "I-I see," and turned her face back to the front. Then, she glanced at my status window from the corner of her eye. No, it’s perfectly fine to look. Why is she sneaking a glance?

<b>

"Swordsman—level 30, huh? Normally, it would take at least a month to get here!?"

<b>

That’s only natural.

<b>

"If you try to level up to 30 only in F-rank dungeons, that’s how it would be. In E-rank, you can reach level 30 in 7 days, and in D-rank, it would take 2 days."

<b>

Sera-san was left dumbfounded with her mouth agape. I continued speaking without caring.

<b>

"But this time frame assumes you’re somewhat accustomed to combat and have been grinding from morning to night, you know? If you take breaks, it would take a bit longer."

<b>

"…As I thought, you’re strange. It’s not a lie that you were summoned, is it? You know too much about this world."

<b>

She looked at me with a suspicious gaze. I might have talked too much.

However, I have no intention of answering honestly. I can’t just say to her face, "You all are created beings."

<b>

I shrugged and replied, "Well, who knows?"

<b>

Understanding that I wasn’t going to answer, Sera-san gave up on pressing me and sighed. Then, she muttered in a complaining tone.

<b>

"To be able to easily conquer a D-rank dungeon, and yet you want to change jobs just because you’re 'bored.' If only I had such talent."

<b>

Sera-san sighed while looking down.

<b>

As for me, I felt irritated by the word "talent" that came from her.

I stopped walking and turned to face her.

<b>

"I’m not just a person of talent."

<b>

"Hmph, with that skill at such a young age—what else could there be besides talent?"

<b>

I furrowed my brow and glared at her.

<b>

"If you’re referring to my 'eyes' as talent, then that’s correct. But if you’re using the word talent for anything else, then if you’re the kind of person who would dismiss my efforts with just that one word—"

<b>

Sera-san was looking into my eyes. She had a bewildered and somewhat frightened expression.

I paused for a moment before speaking again.

<b>

<b>

"I dislike you."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

I’ve done it now.

<b>

She couldn’t possibly know my circumstances, yet I blurted it out in a fit of anger. I regret and reflect on it.

<b>

After all, I used the lofty word "effort," but I was just playing a game. To put it bluntly, it was a form of play.

<b>

But I was serious. I really did my best.

<b>

At least, if someone were to mock that, I would voice my dissatisfaction without thinking about the consequences.

<b>

As for Sera-san, she responded to my statement with, "I-I dislike you too!" but afterward, her mood dropped to the point where passersby did double-takes. I thought that being disliked by me wouldn’t hurt her much, but it seems to have affected her more than I expected.

<b>

Before checking in at the D-rank dungeon, I changed to a brawler.

I couldn’t use the job change function inside the dungeon, and since Regulus-san was talking about assassination and kidnapping, I decided to come this far as a swordsman just in case.

<b>

Recalling my status from the game knowledge in my mind.

<b>

<b>

☆Status☆

<b>

Name: Esuar

Age: 18

Profession: Brawler

Level: 1

STR: E (F)

VIT: G

AGI: F

DEX: G

INT: G

MND: G

Skills: —

<b>

<b>

Normally, the initial status for a brawler would have STR at F, but if the player bonus is working properly, it should be at E.

<b>

If by any chance the status hasn’t increased, I would have to reluctantly use the emergency return function. After all, if STR is at F, it would take too long to defeat enemies.

<b>

By the way, emergency return is a function that allows you to escape from the dungeon at the cost of losing all items obtained, and if you’re on the first floor without any items, there are no significant drawbacks.

<b>

However, since you need to select it from the status window, it’s difficult to use while being attacked by monsters. The window gets in the way and makes it hard to see the monsters' movements.

<b>

After checking in, Sera-san spoke to me in a small voice, being mindful of her surroundings.

<b>

"…Esuar just changed to a brawler a moment ago, right? Is it safe?"

<b>

She was completely different from the furious expression she had before. She had become quite docile.

<b>

"Yes, it’s fine. I’m sorry to take up your time again today, but thank you for your help."

<b>

"…Understood. If anything happens, please use the emergency return—or the communication magic tool. I’ll keep an eye on you."

<b>

"Y-Yes, understood. Thank you for your consideration."

<b>

I replied, bewildered by her drastic change.

<b>

This can’t be considered a good change, can it?

But what should I do? I haven’t acquired any skills to comfort a weakened woman, and I really said something foolish.

<b>

For now, I’ll pray that time will heal things and focus on leveling up.

<b>

In a few days, Sera-san will surely return to her usual self—continuing to glare at me. Whether that’s a good thing or not, I don’t know.
