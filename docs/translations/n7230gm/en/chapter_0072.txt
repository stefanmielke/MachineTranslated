# 69 Completion of the New Residence

<b>

<b>

<b>

Until the new residence is completed, nothing has changed from the time I was in Reinas before the martial arts tournament. Every day is filled with disappointment as I defeat the boss of the B-rank dungeon, only to find that no rings drop.

<b>

Returning to the duke's mansion is no different from those days, and there are no significant changes in my life. The members are, of course, the same.

<b>

The only thing that has changed is that instead of me and Sera taking the lead in battles, we now fight as a party.

<b>

In addition to supporting the three members, I also participate in boss battles to attempt coordinated attacks.

<b>

By the time a month had passed, we were able to clear from the first to the third floor without me. While Sera seems to be leading, I believe that Phenon and Shiri have also become quite strong.

<b>

This dungeon in Reinas is of the ruins type, making it difficult to create a many-against-one scenario, so I expect to struggle again when we go to another dungeon.

<b>

<b>

"I never thought I would be so happy about my companions' growth. When I was playing Tempest, I was too busy focusing on myself."

<b>

As I watched the shadow snakes dissolve into particles, I muttered absentmindedly.

<b>

To aim for the top and to defeat Venom.

I was just desperately training myself to ensure no one could catch up to me. Thanks to that, I am where I am now, and I don’t think that was a bad thing in itself.

<b>

With permission from Raileth, the guild master of the Explorer Guild Reinas branch, I am currently diving into this jungle-type A-rank dungeon. Of course, alone.

<b>

Sera is one thing, but it would be too much for Phenon and Shiri.

<b>

As for me, it is also difficult to conquer this dungeon with my current status, so I am leveling up by fighting lower-tier monsters.

<b>

"Even if I could conquer it, I won’t."

<b>

Muttering my usual soliloquy, I swung my sword at the newly appeared shadow snake. To an outsider, it might look less like a battle and more like a simple task.

After all, I myself only feel like I’m doing a task.

<b>

Dodge, cut, dodge, cut. It’s a repetitive cycle. If I had enough STR and VIT, I could conquer it right now.

<b>

However, I intend to leave the memorable first conquest of the A-rank dungeon to the Thunderbolt’s Trail. The conquest of the A-rank dungeon will likely cause much more of a stir than the B-rank dungeon did.

<b>

After all, an S-rank dungeon will be newly appearing.

<b>

"Make sure to stand out in my place."

<b>

Looking down at the shadow snake that disappeared with a dying scream, I smiled.

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the blink of an eye, two months passed, and we received a report that the building was completed.

<b>

Everyone knew it was nearing completion.

<b>

After all, every time we went to the dungeon, we could see the construction happening in the distance.

Once the exterior was finished, everyone, including me, was restless, and when Roberto came to the duke's mansion today, I couldn’t help but ask, "Is it done!?" I’m really looking forward to it.

<b>

Of course, I wasn’t so excited that I neglected dungeon exploration. I was diligently leveling up.

<b>

After two months of dungeon visits, I raised all remaining secondary jobs to level 30, and for my martial arts swordsman, who was already level 40, I quickly raised it to level 60 to gain new status bonuses.

<b>

<b>

☆ Status ☆

<b>

Name: SR

Age: 18

Occupation: Martial Arts Swordsman

Level: 60

STR: B

VIT: C

AGI: C

DEX: C

INT: D

MND: E

Skills: Presence Detection, Anticipation, Phantom Sword

<b>

<b>

If I challenge it as a martial arts swordsman, I should be able to conquer the A-rank dungeon.

I plan to raise the remaining secondary jobs to level 60 at this pace. By then, Thunderbolt’s Trail will surely conquer the A-rank dungeon.

Then finally, I can change to the untouched third job.

<b>

By the way, I didn’t get a single ring to drop in these two months.

<b>

<b>

<b>

A brand-new single-family home.

I explained it with my mouth and drawings, and they built it imitating a log house found in Japan. It’s a splendidly constructed building that wouldn’t be out of place in a resort area.

They did a great job recreating it from my poor drawings. Well done, old man.

<b>

I don’t know the names of the woods in this world, but they used dark brown wood with a clear grain, giving it a solid and heavy appearance.

<b>

The terrace that juts out like a bow from the second floor was Phenon’s request.

I was worried that the rounded terrace would look out of place since I had a boxy impression of log houses, but now that it’s completed, it actually looks quite nice.

<b>

In addition to the terrace, there is also a spacious wooden deck, allowing us to fully enjoy the outdoor scenery. We probably couldn’t have done this in the city, so it was indeed the right choice to build outside the city.

<b>

If this building were in the city of Reinas, it would likely be the second largest house after the duke's mansion.

<b>

<b>

As I opened the door on behalf of everyone, I heard surprised voices from behind saying "Oh!" and "Wow!"

As the oldest in mental age, I suppressed the urge to shout, "Yay!" and simply grinned while admiring the interior. Roberto shot me a strange look, but I ignored it. I am satisfied.

<b>

"Let’s see the inside quickly!!"

<b>

Phenon, taking the lead, tried to move forward. I hurriedly grabbed her collar to stop her progress. Phenon let out a "Gueh," like a squashed frog.

Somehow, I’ve become careless in handling the princess… I should be more careful in public. Well, Roberto is here too, but still.

<b>

Well, both Phenon and Sera treat him like air, so it’s probably fine.

<b>

"Phenon, this house is strictly no shoes allowed. I explained before that you need to take off your shoes before entering, right?"

<b>

"I-I forgot."

<b>

Sticking her tongue out playfully, she said. I forgave her because she was cute.

<b>

Next to her, Sera silently took off her shoes, eager to be the first inside.

She tried to sneak in ahead of everyone but was grabbed by Phenon’s collar and let out a confused "Kyu."

<b>

"I’m going with you!"

<b>

"…But you were trying to go alone, Phenon."

<b>

"W-Would it be okay if I joined you!?"

<b>

The three of them hurried inside, leaving me behind. Hey, hey, don’t leave the leader behind.

<b>

In the end, only Roberto and I were left in the entrance.

He looked at me with a wry smile and peered into my face.

<b>

"Um, may I explain the rooms to you? First, the living room—" "Please start with the bathroom!" 

<b>

Interrupting Roberto’s words, I asked him to guide us to the bathroom, which was my biggest excitement.

It’s unfair that only Sera and the others get to see it! I want to see it too! by 33 years old.

<b>

Roberto let out a dry laugh as if he had given up.
