# A-110 Reward Proposal

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the current world, the S-rank dungeons of the three countries, Lindale, Rezel, and Palmour, are being cleared. I plan to have my parents summoned at the moment we clear one more S-rank dungeon.

<b>

If my parents do not wish to be resurrected, I will need to come up with another plan, but knowing those two, they will probably wish for reincarnation without hesitation.

<b>

"Which country should we choose next?"

<b>

While enjoying the kotatsu at the freshly made Crescent and Hisui's house, Hisui, who had been looking out the window, turns to face me.

<b>

"Shall we split up the work? That way, it might go quickly."

<b>

"Hmm... that's an option, but I still can't think of what reward to ask from Idea-sama."

<b>

Ideally, I want to consider their feelings, but according to Noah, it seems like 'any wish other than mine will probably not be acknowledged.' I have conveyed this to both of them, just in case.

<b>

"Well, there's no need to rush. We have infinite time."

<b>

"That's an exaggeration."

<b>

I retort to Sera, who is enjoying the kotatsu just like me. By the way, Fenon and Shiri are also here, but they are exploring the garden with Crescent.

<b>

Hisui was probably watching Fenon and the others from the window just now.

<b>

Hmm... what would be a good reward for clearing an S-rank dungeon?

<b>

I do have the desire to fight strong enemies in a close battle, but in this situation where there are people who care about me, I think it's not good to engage in battles that are so close to death.

<b>

It's difficult to have a situation like Tempest, where you can revive even after dying...

It would be nice if a new dungeon could be created that allows for revival after death and is still high difficulty.

<b>

"Hmm, I can create something like that without any problems."

<b>

"---! I-Idea-sama!?"

<b>

Suddenly.

<b>

The familiar deity from Earth appeared in the seat across from me, separated by the kotatsu.

Dressed in her usual kimono, her hair styled in a bun adorned with a luxurious hairpin, just like always.

<b>

Wait, did Idea-sama just say she can create it?

That means she can create a high-difficulty dungeon where you can revive after dying.

<b>

"That's exactly what I mean."

<b>

"Seriously?"

<b>

"Seriously--- if you have no other wishes besides calling your parents, I can create such a dungeon anew."

<b>

O-oh... what an attractive condition.

<b>

For someone like me, who loves combat, this is a condition that I can't help but jump at, even if there are strong suspicions of it being a scam. After all, there’s no one else I want to call from Earth besides my parents.

<b>

But well, I can't decide this all by myself... I’m not that self-centered.

I should consult with everyone and let them decide.

<b>

"So, that's why I gathered everyone here."

<b>

Sera, who was listening beside me, and Hisui, who was in the same living room, already knew the content, but I reiterated the same story in front of everyone.

<b>

The members of ASR, the members of the Thunderbolt Trail, Regulus-san, who returned from the ruined world of the past, and the Earth group. Eleven of us, including myself, gathered.

<b>

As they listened to my story, they seemed intrigued, but for some reason, they smiled in a troubled manner.

Not understanding why they were laughing, I tilted my head, and Shin, who had exchanged glances with everyone, spoke up.

<b>

"Honestly, I think everyone thinks it's fine as long as you're having fun--- since the wish granted by Idea-sama is essentially a reward for you, there's no need for us to give our approval, right?"

<b>

Is that so? As I pondered this question and looked at everyone's faces again, they all nodded in agreement.

<b>

"Well, we're all for it if it means you can have fun. An S-rank dungeon isn't really challenging enough for us."

<b>

"That's right. I thought maybe I could have a little fun with Rezel's S-rank, but if the opponent is too weak, I can't really tell the difference. Plus, it seems like I could finally fight SR-san with all my strength after a long time."

<b>

Two girls seriously expressing such thoughts.

<b>

Seeing that, the inhabitants of this world--- except for Noah, all had strained expressions. Once they max out all their classes, they would surely understand how they feel. Probably.

<b>

"If SR-san can enjoy it, then I'm all for it."

<b>

"I agree as well."

<b>

When Fenon and Sera said that, Shiri also chimed in, "I-I feel the same way!"

The members of the Thunderbolt Trail were muttering things like "battle maniac" and "dungeon idiot," but there was no atmosphere of opposition.

<b>

Regulus-san seemed to think that the emergence of a new dungeon would increase his workload, as he placed a hand on his forehead, but it should be fine. I hope he does his best.

<b>

"Big brother, you look like you're having fun."

<b>

And Noah was grinning as she looked at my face.

<b>

Did it show that much on my face?---I feel a bit guilty, as I seem to be more excited than when I found out I could call my parents.
