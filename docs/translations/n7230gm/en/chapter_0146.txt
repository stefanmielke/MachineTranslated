# A-32 Morning in the New Home

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the end, I spent the entire day without stepping outside the house. I deepened my interactions with the servants, who felt almost like family, while exploring the finer details of my new home. After all, I'm an explorer!

<b>

Since it was a property that seemed to have once been an inn, there were more than enough rooms. And because the building was completely rebuilt from scratch, it turned out to be a splendid house that looked like it belonged to a wealthy person. You wouldn't easily come across such a luxurious villa even in Japan's summer resorts. Though, of course, there’s no pool.

<b>

After dinner, the knights came to escort Sera and Phenon back to their respective homes. Of course, Shiri, who was in charge of Phenon, was with them.

Sera and Phenon both wore somewhat dissatisfied expressions, while Shiri, looking a bit reluctant, left the party house with the words, "I will come right after breakfast."

<b>

And then, night.

As the members of the Thunderbolt Brigade and the servants began to settle into their respective rooms――

<b>

"I want to get the other third jobs to level 100 once the S-rank dungeon is unlocked."

<b>

I lay face down on my bed in my room, directing my face towards Noah, who was sitting on the sofa.

She heard my words and chuckled, "It's not like it's prohibited or anything."

<b>

"Well, that's true. But once we conquer the S-rank dungeon, the world will definitely start buzzing, right?"

<b>

Considering what happened when we conquered the B-rank and A-rank dungeons, that future was easy to imagine.

<b>

"Hmm... that’s only if an SS-rank dungeon appears, right? For now, we don’t know if the S-rank dungeon is the end or if there will be more. If no new dungeons appear, no one will notice, right?"

<b>

"Ah... now that you mention it, that's true."

<b>

"But either way, isn’t it fine to just level up? You can't progress without conquering it, and you want to get the Sword Saint to level 100, right?"

<b>

Noah stretched her back and yawned as she spoke.

<b>

"If there's going to be a match showcase, that is. If it's just the Sword Saint, I think I can manage it in about three months."

<b>

If it were to include other jobs, it would indeed take years, but leveling up the attack-focused Sword Saint is relatively easy. I've already leveled up a bit, and I want to acquire the 'Pinnacle of Martial Arts' that comes with reaching level 100 as a Sword Saint.

The reason why that skill is necessary for the showcase is partly to gain recognition from those around me with overwhelming power, but I also want to show off to my fiancées.

<b>

"I still don't know what form that showcase will take. It might be okay just to conquer the S-rank dungeon."

<b>

"That sounds a bit lonely in its own way. It would be anticlimactic."

<b>

"Hehe, that’s a typical thought for you, big brother. You’re hoping for a new challenging dungeon to appear, right? I can tell without even reading your mind."

<b>

"You understand me well."

<b>

She has been observing me since my gaming days, so she might know me better than I know myself.

<b>

The next morning.

As I woke up, taking in the unfamiliar ceiling, I lightly tidied myself up and gazed out the window at the capital city.

It's a three-story building, and for reasons unknown to me, it's built slightly higher than the surrounding structures, allowing me to view the capital city without obstruction.

<b>

"I'm still not used to this."

<b>

It's only the second day, so that's to be expected.

One day, this house will probably feel like home, but that day is still far off.

<b>

While I was lost in thought, resting my elbows on the window sill, I heard a knock on the door.

When I responded, Aine, Shiri's older sister, entered the room, saying, "Excuse me."

<b>

"Good morning, SR-sama. Breakfast is ready, so please wash your face and come to the dining room."

<b>

Her appearance, perfectly dressed in a maid outfit, resembled Shiri—though not exactly, they were similar enough to be recognized as sisters.

Shiri's hair color seems to be a family trait, as both parents and Aine have the same black hair. The hair tied up at the back of her head would likely reach down to her back if let loose.

<b>

"Good morning. Is everyone else already up?"

<b>

"Noah-sama seemed to be hungry, so she has already taken her seat for breakfast. The members of the Thunderbolt Brigade are said to wake up slowly, so I came to you first, SR-sama. Also— as I mentioned yesterday, please refrain from using honorifics with us. There are rumors that a weak person who can't even stand up to servants might arise."

<b>

"Ah... that's right. I think it's fine to let those who want to say it say it."

<b>

It's a hassle. Just let me speak freely.

<b>

"Hehe, I think not discriminating against others is one of SR-sama's wonderful traits, but I appreciate your understanding. I also have a desire to become closer to my sister's beloved."

<b>

I had somewhat anticipated this from the situation with Shiri's family yesterday, but it seems they were aware of it.

I don't know if Shiri revealed it herself or if the family made their own assumptions.

<b>

For now, I guess it's best to just smile and brush it off.

<b>

"Hahaha, I want to get along too. Since we're all family, I think of it as a big family—oh, and let me mention something important."

<b>

There's no need to hide it anymore, and since it would surprise them if I suddenly brought it up, I prefaced it with, "For now, keep this to yourselves," and then I talked about my future plans.

To gain recognition from the king and others, I plan to clear the S-rank dungeon alone. If that doesn't work, I’m considering a match with the members of the Thunderbolt Brigade or the Vinzett siblings and Sera, who are participants in the martial arts tournament.

<b>

Upon hearing this, Aine's eyes widened, and she froze.

<b>

"That is... if I may be so bold, isn't that a bit reckless? Even if SR-sama is stronger than anyone else, to tackle an unexplored dungeon alone..."

<b>

It's understandable that she would think that. The people in this world haven't developed to that extent yet.

<b>

"—Look, see for yourself."

<b>

Saying that, I displayed my status screen.

<b>

As she looked anxious, I made sure to show her the window with jobs other than the Overlord. Naturally, the levels were displayed alongside the jobs. Numbers like 100 and 90 were likely something Aine had never seen before.

As I showed her the second jobs, derived second jobs, and third jobs in order, she gulped, leaning in close enough that her chin rested on my shoulder.

<b>

Finally, when she opened her mouth, she said,

<b>

"SR-sama, could it be that you are a, a god――?"

<b>

She said that in a trembling voice. How did it come to that?

<b>

"That's not it! I just have knowledge and experience; I'm just a human like you and Aine. I believe everyone can reach that level with time spent in the dungeons."

<b>

By the way, if there were a god, they would be eating downstairs in the dining room right now.
