# A-132 Exhausted Three

<b>

<b>

<b>

Upon discovering the words "Lindale District" in the residential area within the dungeon, we hypothesized that "perhaps newly created dungeons are connected internally."

<b>

However, this is still just a hypothesis, and there is a good chance that Lady Idea simply named it on a whim.

<b>

Nevertheless, the dungeon newly created by Lady Idea has a different structure from previous dungeons, and it could be said that its interior resembles another world, so I believe there is a significant possibility.

<b>

Regarding this matter, I made sure to report it properly so that I wouldn't be scolded later by Regulus for not mentioning such an important thing. Being reprimanded, no matter how old you are, is unpleasant.

<b>

"---That was the kind of day it was. As for Sera and the others... yeah, they seem to have worked really hard."

<b>

You can tell just by looking at their faces.

<b>

Sera, Phenon, Shiri, and I were gathered around the dining table for a debriefing, but all three of them were showing signs of fatigue in their expressions. Even though they hadn't pulled an all-nighter, they looked like they might collapse at any moment.

<b>

"If you're tired, it's okay to sleep."

<b>

When I said that, Sera raised her palm towards me to signal me to wait. Then she slowly shook her head.

<b>

"There's no need for that. Right now, this space, this air, and the voice of Esuar are healing me. It reminds me of the lullabies I heard in my childhood."

<b>

It's not a lullaby; it's a report. You're definitely sleepy, aren't you?

<b>

When I asked, as expected, the three of them had been trained by Noah in the S-rank dungeon from morning till night.

<b>

This time, since it was a dungeon where they could die normally, Noah didn't seem to give them overly difficult trials, but since they understood that "if they die, it's over," the mental fatigue was reportedly immense. Additionally, it seems they ended up using a fair number of high-grade potions.

<b>

It's fine since we have plenty in stock, but it seems their hearts are struggling with pain and fear.

<b>

"Are Phenon and Shiri okay?"

<b>

Judging that Sera seemed to be fine for now, I turned to the other two.

<b>

"Yes! I'm fine too! Noah's guidance is strict, but she knows so many things about fighting, so I feel like I'm getting stronger and it's fun!"

<b>

"I also learned archery from Noah, and she can do anything, right? O-of course, Esuar is even more amazing! But wow, to be better than a former god, Esuar is really incredible."

<b>

Although Phenon and Shiri also showed signs of fatigue, they seemed to feel a sense of accomplishment. Noah must have been watching our battles in Tempest all along, so she likely has a wealth of knowledge.

It's interesting how knowledge alone can't solve everything in that game.

<b>

"So, where did Noah go?"

<b>

"She's already sleeping in her room. She said, 'I might be a nuisance today, so I'm going to sleep first.'"

<b>

"She's not really a nuisance, though."

<b>

She's acting for our sake, so no one would complain about her. It seems that Sera and the others have properly expressed their gratitude to her as well.

<b>

When I see her next, I should also say, "Thank you for teaching Sera and the others."

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I didn't think of it that way when she said nuisance."

<b>

Phenon, Sera, and Shiri appeared in my bedroom.

In this party house in Lindale, unlike the house we built near Renas, each person has their own separate bedroom.

<b>

Even so, the rooms are spacious, and each has beds that could comfortably accommodate five or six people. We need to spend money on things like this to keep the economy going. There's no ulterior motive. After all, no matter how much I spend, my money keeps increasing.

<b>

But still... how did it come to this?

<b>

"W-well, it's not like Shiri wants to sleep with us at night---ugh---anyway, we decided that we should all sleep together tonight! That's really all there is to it!"

<b>

"Today was quite tough, so Sera and I wanted to be with Esuar, but we felt sorry for Shiri being alone."

<b>

"I'm sorry... I know I'm a nuisance, but please take care of me."

<b>

Sera, Phenon, and Shiri each called out to me, likely seeing the blank expression on my face. I snapped back to reality and processed their words in my mind.

<b>

From their words, it seems that after receiving strict guidance from Noah today, they found it mentally tough, so even though this is a party house, Sera and Phenon want to sleep with me.

<b>

And if that happens, Shiri, who also had a tough time, would be left alone. That must have been a no-go for Sera and Phenon.

<b>

Of course, I also think it's sad to leave Shiri, who seems to be feeling lonely. But wouldn't the solution be for Sera and the others to sleep together?

<b>

...Yeah, I'm not that oblivious. I can feel the affection from Sera, Phenon, and even Shiri as a romantic interest. And I mostly understand that Sera and Phenon acknowledge that.

<b>

"â€¦For now, let's talk about today's results and other things. I only heard a rough outline earlier, and there might be some advice I can give."

<b>

When love and romance come into play, I tend to become conscious of various things, so I decided to talk about battles and dungeons instead. With this topic, I can engage enthusiastically, and it can also be helpful for them.

<b>

"Also, to check if we're connected to other dungeons, we might stay overnight in the dungeon soon, so let's go together then."

<b>

As I sat on the bed and said this, the three of them each responded happily in agreement.

Yeah, this is a good flow. It's not that I'm particularly bad with adult matters, but I'm not married to Shiri. This is normal. We're just sleeping in the same room and the same bed.

<b>

Well, in the end, we ended up playing a strange game where we took turns giving each other lap pillows. Aren't you all the tired ones? Why am I the one getting a lap pillow while you all recover?

<b>

---What will I be like tomorrow morning?
