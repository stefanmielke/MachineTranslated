# 8 I Might Be Quite Foolish

<b>

～Record of a Certain Communication～

<b>

<b>

"Yes, then let's convey it that way."

<b>

"Indeed, I leave it to you, Regulus. However, I still can't believe you easily dealt with Sera-Bernot. I've heard that person is quite skilled among explorers."

<b>

"It's understandable that Lord Dino would find it hard to believe. After all, even I, who watched the mock battle right in front of me, am doubting whether it was a dream."

<b>

"Hahaha! Regulus, who was said to be the best in the kingdom, is saying that. Truly, what a surprise that Sir SR is. To think he hadn't chosen a profession until yesterday."

<b>

"I was suspicious as well and asked to see his status after the mock battle—but as he said, he was a level 5 swordsman. SR may not have high physical abilities, but he overwhelmed with skill alone."

<b>

"…Hmm. I understand now why he said he didn't need a guard. Indeed, having someone weaker than himself accompanying him in a dungeon would only be a hindrance."

<b>

"That's right. SR is the hope of Her Highness the Princess—and by extension, our hope for Her Highness. We can't push him too hard, but let's provide support as much as possible."

<b>

"Indeed. I shall speak with His Majesty about the hope we see. Just to confirm—he really did say he wants to save Her Highness the Princess, correct?"

<b>

"Yes. He certainly said so."

<b>

"…Understood. Then, rather than formally requesting him to conquer a B-rank dungeon, let's leave it to his will. However, do report his progress to me regularly."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Is it here yet?"

<b>

How many times have I said this line in the past two days?

And how many times have I put this tea and cookies in my mouth?

<b>

That's right—I was leaning back on the sofa, which I had grown accustomed to in this now-standard private room.

<b>

Honestly.

It's almost lunchtime… I want a proper meal, not just something to fill my small stomach like cookies. Well, these cookies are delicious, but still, they're not something to eat in large quantities, right?

<b>

After that, Sera was taken to the treatment room by the guild staff. It's already been 30 minutes since the mock battle ended, so it wouldn't be strange if she were awake. After all, this world has both recovery magic and potions.

<b>

Knock, knock—a familiar sound echoed. Before I could respond, the door opened. This way of entering must be Regulus.

<b>

"Sorry to keep you waiting."

<b>

The guild master entered without any sign of guilt, just as I expected.

<b>

"No, no. However, I would like a different snack prepared next time. Having the same thing three times in a row is quite boring."

<b>

Regulus was complaining to me too much, so I couldn't help but want to make a light joke. He must have a personality that is easy to like.

<b>

"Hey—those are high-class snacks meant for nobles!"

<b>

"Whether high-class, middle-class, or low-class, the same thing gets boring."

<b>

"Such a selfish…"

<b>

He sighed and plopped down on the sofa across from me.

<b>

"First of all, let me address what SR is most concerned about. For now, permission to enter E-rank dungeons has been granted even for lower classes. Show this paper at the reception when your status is checked."

<b>

As he said this, he placed an envelope on the table and slid it toward me.

<b>

"Can I take a look inside?"

<b>

"Ah, go ahead."

<b>

I took the envelope and pulled out the paper inside.

Then I read through the text written on it.

<b>

"……Oh."

<b>

The content was very simple.

<b>

You can enter F-rank dungeons with just a license, but for E-rank dungeons, you need a license that shows you have conquered a F-rank dungeon, display your status at the reception, and present your profession.

<b>

It seems that by submitting this envelope, I can be exempted from displaying my status. Ultimately, I planned to challenge the B-rank dungeon with a derivative secondary profession that no one in this world knows about yet, so it looks like I can avoid unnecessary commotion.

<b>

As I internally celebrated my lucky break, Regulus spoke up again.

<b>

"However, there is a condition."

<b>

He said it in a serious—rather, tense-sounding voice.

<b>

Oh no, I dislike this. Conditions that come up later are usually troublesome.

<b>

"Indeed, SR will have a guard assigned."

<b>

See? It's a troublesome one.

<b>

"You saw the mock battle, right? It's unnecessary."

<b>

"Indeed, you are strong. To the point of being astonishing."

<b>

"Then—"

<b>

It's not like it's a big deal.

I was about to say that, but I fell silent in front of the unspoken pressure I felt from Regulus.

<b>

"SR wants to save the princess, right? If something were to happen to you, what would happen to the princess?"

<b>

"That is… indeed, that's true. But that doesn't work."

<b>

It's not about being troublesome or wanting my own time; if we enter the same room in the dungeon, the experience points will be divided regardless of who defeats the monsters. In other words, I wouldn't be able to level up in time.

<b>

Noticing my expression, Regulus said, "Don't worry."

<b>

"When entering the dungeon, it seems you won't need to have a guard."

<b>

"—Huh? A guard, right? Isn't it usually the other way around?"

<b>

What on earth is this bald-headed guy talking about?

Are they saying no guards inside the dungeon but guards in the city? Does that even make sense?

<b>

"Of course, to be honest, they would prefer you to have a guard even inside the dungeon—but you want to go to a high-rank dungeon to level up quickly, right?"

<b>

He understands well. I nodded, "Yes."

<b>

"Then a guard would be a hindrance—so said Lord Dino. Also, this is my opinion, but I believe SR can handle the shallow layers of a B-rank dungeon in his current state."

<b>

Lord Dino is such a good person! He had a weak presence during the game!

And Regulus, his observational skills are impressive. I think I can manage that much. Just barely, though.

<b>

"I don't think you'll fall behind in a dungeon where the number and types of monsters are known. If an unexpected situation arises, it would be you getting kidnapped or assassinated."

<b>

"What!? Is the royal capital that unsafe!?"

<b>

If that's the case, then he might be right; a guard might be necessary. If I were attacked while sleeping, strength wouldn't mean anything at all.

As I waited for Regulus's response while sweating nervously, he answered in a carefree tone.

<b>

"No, not at all. It's completely peaceful. There are few crimes even in the surrounding towns, let alone the royal capital."

<b>

"…I don't understand what you mean."

<b>

"To be honest, it was just right for Sera's punishment. That girl is banned from dungeon exploration for ten days. If she were guarding you, she wouldn't have time to dive into dungeons, right?"

<b>

What is that?

<b>

"…I have some things I don't quite agree with. Can I ask two questions?"

<b>

At my inquiry, Regulus replied, "Sure."

<b>

"First, what will Sera do while I'm diving into the dungeon?"

<b>

"She'll wait outside. I'll give both you and Sera a magical tool that allows communication between inside and outside the dungeon, so if a dangerous situation arises, call Sera with that."

<b>

Such a magical tool exists? That's convenient.

So, whether in the dungeon or in the city, Sera's presence would serve as insurance. Indeed, she did say she was the daughter of a count, and just having her around could deter other lower nobles.

<b>

But still.

<b>

"One more thing… can the guard be someone else? I'm really provoking Sera a lot…"

<b>

Having someone I provoked so much as a guard would be too suffocating.

<b>

I had thought I wouldn't need a guard if I won, but I should have thought more carefully before acting.

<b>

"That's your own fault."

<b>

You have a point.

<b>

"And besides, you heard the conversation earlier, right? This is also a punishment for Sera. And she is one of the few people who knows your circumstances. So the guard will be Sera—this is a decision."

<b>

"Of course."

<b>

I sighed deeply, feeling heavy.

<b>

"By the way, you mentioned Sera's guard would be for ten days, but what happens after that?"

<b>

"That's still undecided. I'll contact you later."

<b>

I sighed deeply again.

<b>

"…Understood. I intend to save the princess, but if I feel too uncomfortable, I will leave this country."

<b>

I wanted to make that clear.

Regulus, with a strained expression, said, "I'll let Lord Dino know."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

After finishing the discussion with Regulus and stepping outside the room, I found Sera waiting there. It seems she had been waiting outside for our conversation to end.

This room is soundproof, so she probably couldn't hear what was said inside.

<b>

I felt that her previously glaring gaze had softened a bit. Well, she was still glaring, though.

<b>

As soon as I opened my mouth, I offered my apologies to Sera.

<b>

"I apologize for my rude remarks before the match. I find it easier to fight when I'm being attacked rather than attacking myself, so I resorted to such means."

<b>

I didn't bow 90 degrees, but I lowered my head somewhat.

Then I heard a small voice.

<b>

"—It was my win."

<b>

"Huh? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you well."

<b>

"That match was my victory. I had already landed a hit on you before I lost consciousness."

<b>

She spoke in a way that sounded both angry and sulky. Her expression was just like that of a child in elementary school who didn't get a toy they wanted.

<b>

"—Huh!? I didn't notice at all! Is that true!?"

<b>

"…It's true. At that time, my attack with my chin hit your hand."

<b>

What kind of attack with the chin? Isn't that just self-destruction?

<b>

"……Huh?"

<b>

"So that was my victory."

<b>

She pouted for a moment, then turned her face away.

She must have realized that her claim was unreasonable, as her ears were slightly red.

I was left speechless by such a childish assertion. I could only stand there, dumbfounded.

<b>

<b>

In any case, I learned two things about her, the one who would be guarding me from now on.

<b>

First. She's quite competitive.

<b>

Second. —She might be quite foolish.
