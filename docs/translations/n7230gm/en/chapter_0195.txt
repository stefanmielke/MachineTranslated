# A-78 Air, Dead!

<b>

<b>

<b>

Well, not really.

I'm not ashamed of being married to Sera.

<b>

I want to brag about how beautiful and cute she is, including Pheno, and I feel like she's too good for me, but considering that we're in the middle of a match, I can understand wanting to hide my face. Sera has her clumsy moments, after all.

<b>

By the way, regarding the match, it was decided in less than thirty seconds after Crescent declared, "Let's finish this quickly so I can ask you everything!" Since there was no damage, our team was in a zombie attack state, but when we were all blown away in all directions, I signaled the end of the match. The way we were blown away was beyond just fractures.

<b>

So, currently.

<b>

Although there are no injuries, the four of us who are exhausted and drained are slumped on the ground, while the energetic Crescent is approaching us.

<b>

"Did you get married here, SR-san!? Are you single over there!? By the way, how old are you really!? By the way, I'm twenty-four years old at the time of my death!"

<b>

No, no, we're alive right now, so don't use the term "at the time of my death"! It feels a bit horror-like!

<b>

――However, Crescent is younger than I thought.

I had the image of her being a long-time professional, so I thought she was a bit older... Maybe she was a pro gamer since her teens. Well, from that lively youthful character, I thought she was younger.

<b>

"Ahaha... As you know, I was in a relationship with Tempest, so if I had gotten married, I would have been dumped long ago. I came here when I was thirty-three, but my body has rejuvenated to eighteen. Now I'm twenty-one."

<b>

"The avatar and reality are different, right...? I'm not this much of a beautiful girl."

<b>

Ahaha... Crescent said with a dry laugh. That's a topic I don't want to touch too much, so I smiled wryly and decided to change the subject.

<b>

"How old are you now, Crescent? You can check your status."

<b>

"Seriously? Um—oh, I've rejuvenated to twenty! I'm younger in both real life and here! So SR-san, you should stop using honorifics right now!"

<b>

"Uh... well, I'll do my best."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"So, the people in this world didn't know about bonuses, so they were stumbling at B rank."

<b>

"Ah, indeed, if you can't see the status, you might not realize it. It's a bit strange for us since it's normal for us."

<b>

I continued talking with Crescent—who I was forced to drop the honorifics and call by her name—but nearby, Sera and the members of the Thunder's Trail had also come over, listening to our conversation with a sense of nostalgia. Everyone was sitting on the ground.

<b>

By the way, the window for returning was displayed, but it seemed that Lady Idea had taken care of it, and there was no time limit. I'm grateful.

<b>

"With a one-month time limit, you can't afford to leisurely level up to thirty with just F rank, right? So I negotiated to get into a higher rank."

<b>

"Oh, I see... Knowing SR-san, you must have used some forceful tactics in your negotiation, right?"

<b>

"Is that the kind of character I am!? Well, I did ask to have a one-on-one duel, though."

<b>

"That's definitely forceful!"

<b>

"That stings a bit—well, that's fine. The opponent I faced was a level sixty swordsman, and—"

<b>

"SR-san, you beat that opponent while keeping your initial stats, right—"

<b>

As Crescent overlapped my words, she said,

<b>

"Wait, SR! Please stop talking about that!"

<b>

In our conversation, Sera couldn't help but jump in with a distressed look. Sorry, Sera... But it was an inseparable part of how you and I met.

<b>

"Ugh!? Could that swordsman be—"

<b>

"Y-yeah, that's me..."

<b>

Sera, with her face and ears bright red, muttered in a wilted voice. I'm sorry.

Well, discussing this in detail would only torment Sera, so I decided to move on.

<b>

"That's when I first met Sera. And since she couldn't leave an otherworlder like me alone, she became my bodyguard."

<b>

"The person who lost to SR-san is now a bodyguard...?"

<b>

Crescent seemed to mean no harm, but it hit Sera hard, and she was holding her head, saying, "Please stop..."

I'm really sorry again.

<b>

"So, the two of us were leveling up, but since the princess's condition worsened and we were running out of time, we decided to increase our party size. Fortunately, the strongest party in Lindale had three members, so I persuaded them to join us."

<b>

"Oh! What's this exciting development!? And I'm curious about the strongest people in this country! I really like fighting strong people, so if there's a chance, I'd love to have a match with them!"

<b>

Crescent, listening to my story, said excitedly while leaning forward.

...I really didn't mean to do it on purpose... I just wanted to build up the story a bit.

I could feel the awkward atmosphere from Sera and Shin intensifying.

Should I press the return button? No, I shouldn't...

<b>

"S-so, the other three here besides Sera are the 'Thunder's Trail' party, right...?"

<b>

Air, dead!
