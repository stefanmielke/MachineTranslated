# A-66 VS The Crimson Sword

<b>

<b>

"What the hell is that skill!? I've never heard of it!"

<b>

"There shouldn't have been such a weird skill even in the secondary derived classes!"

<b>

After the match concluded, the members of 'The Crimson Sword' were visibly shaken, even as they healed each other.

In particular, the two who had charged in first—having approached the match with optimism—seemed frustrated that they had been outdone by the still youthful-looking Noah.

As I eavesdropped somewhat, it seemed they were discussing wanting a rematch.

<b>

However,

<b>

"The girl who used the skill that makes her body heavy is over level 60 in her third job. Don't judge by appearances."

<b>

Neska, the party leader, sharply interjected to her teammates.

From her perspective, Noah had cleared an A-rank dungeon while holding back, and it was clear that they had little hope of winning even if they rematched.

<b>

In response to Neska's words, the other members seemed unable to retort and fell silent.

Indeed, judging Noah by her appearance would lead to painful consequences. Her actual age is on a completely different scale from us humans.

<b>

"I wish you wouldn't think too much about a woman's age."

<b>

"Don't read people's minds without permission. Besides, what are we supposed to do about this? Isn't the opponent's fighting spirit completely diminished? Is there even a point for me to fight?"

<b>

"Is it okay for you to be treated like a fool?"

<b>

"Well, it's not like I was treated like a fool. They were just talking about appearances."

<b>

As I said this with a hint of exasperation, the other three, excluding Noah, began to voice their thoughts one after another.

<b>

"But I want to see my husband’s cool side!"

<b>

"Me too!"

<b>

"Um, I would also like to see it for my own learning purposes."

<b>

It seemed that not just Noah, but the other three also desired a match. That was a pleasant surprise.

However, they must have seen my fights numerous times already... Well, if asked whether I had shown all my techniques, I would certainly say no.

<b>

"Well, if the opponent wants to fight... I guess? It was originally their suggestion, so it's not for us to decide."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

In the end, it was decided that we would fight.

It seems that Neska had forcibly convinced the four members.

<b>

In front of me stood two with puzzled expressions, two who seemed cautious, and Neska, whose eyes sparkled with excitement.

<b>

"Did you say that the Thunderbolt's trajectory was 'always losing' in the international martial arts tournament? Is that about you?"

<b>

The quiet woman who had been observing me asked this.

<b>

"Well, I have never lost to them."

<b>

"I see. Then, is it okay for us to go all out?"

<b>

"Of course. All five of you should come at me without holding back, intending to kill."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

The woman nodded and then signaled to the leader, Neska. I assumed it meant there was nothing more to discuss.

Thanks to the international martial arts tournament, a clear hierarchy was established: Thunderbolt's trajectory above them, and me above that.

They might have found this easier to understand than the match against 'Moon,' which they hadn't seen.

<b>

Once the guild master-like person finished the pre-match explanation, Neska called out to me.

<b>

"I intend to borrow your strength in this challenge."

<b>

While I was happy to be respected, it pained me slightly since I was originally a NEET.

Being told I was amazing in the game and in reality carried different weights.

<b>

"Then, I will do my best to fight in a way that does not bring shame to the name of the Emperor. Though I will be using the Sword Saint class."

<b>

Since I had no excuse for using unknown skills or special weapons, I planned to fight without skills and with a wooden sword.

Well, the status increase from 'The Pinnacle of Martial Arts' was unavoidable, so I hoped they would overlook that.

<b>

<b>

Eventually, at the guild master's signal, the match began—however,

<b>

"Hmm."

<b>

Neska and the man in the front line seemed to be gauging my movements, showing no intent to charge.

Magic was shot from behind them, but the distance made it easy to dodge. I could avoid it just by moving at a walking pace.

<b>

Alright, let's just walk in and charge.

<b>

So, I approached them with the wooden sword in my right hand, moving as if I were walking through the town. It felt somewhat pointless to have created distance before the match, but let's call it a stylistic choice.

<b>

"Here they come!"

<b>

Yes. They are coming.

<b>

Neska and the man split to the sides and charged at me from diagonally ahead. From the front came arrows—and right behind them, magic was closing in.

Hmm, it seems the healer is positioned somewhere between the archer and the mage.

<b>

Both frontliners wield swords, which is a fairly common setup.

After all, you don't often see martial classes like Rezell's Jill-Vinzet or Laika.

<b>

"Here we go!"

<b>

I dodged Neska's sword and deflected the man's sword with my wooden sword, then tripped him.

It wasn't enough to knock him down, but as he staggered, magic and arrows were closing in.

<b>

"—Ugh!"

<b>

The moment I confirmed that Neska noticed this, I immediately kicked the man's stomach, then lightly tapped the back of her neck with my wooden sword as she turned to respond to the magic and arrows, and dashed towards the healer.

<b>

"Th-That was fast!"

<b>

The healer of 'The Crimson Sword' had her eyes wide open in surprise.

I struck the man and sent him flying, but my strike was lighter than his. Our builds are different, and the pain should be somewhat similar, I guess.

<b>

"Please, keep coming at me. As I said earlier, do come intending to kill. Don't worry, I still have no intention of losing to you."

<b>

If they could defeat me, how happy I would be.
