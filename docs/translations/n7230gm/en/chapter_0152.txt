# A-37 Did I say something good!?

The first volume of the comic adaptation is now available for pre-order!

It seems there's an electronic version as well.

<b>

A week has passed since I met His Majesty at the royal castle.

<b>

In preparation for the decisive battle, I considered raising all my job levels to their maximum and acquiring all skills, but it would take far too long.

Moreover, there's no point in gathering skills I won't use, and the people from 'Moon' are not so lenient as to let me try out a makeshift combat style.

<b>

"I remember more than I thought."

<b>

Alone in my room, sitting cross-legged, I mutter such thoughts with my eyes closed.

<b>

For the past few days, I have been solely focused on closing my eyes and recalling battles in Tempest.

The fights of true masters, far removed from the inhabitants of this world.

<b>

In this world, I would say Sera is the closest to that level, but she still has a long way to go. If her stats were properly aligned, she might be able to contend with those ranked around a thousand.

<b>

Even if I gathered the top ten from this world, including Sera, and arranged a mock battle, I would unfortunately have to evaluate it as inferior compared to the strength of 'Moon'.

There is a significant gap between them and the gamers who have repeatedly trained without regard for death. It is truly cheating.

<b>

"The Overlord... If I could have tried this class during the game era, I could easily predict how the matches would go."

<b>

It is still just past two in the afternoon.

The party members seem to be spending their time as they wish, relaxing at home, going out into the town, or heading to the royal castle.

<b>

We eat together and sometimes share tea time, but they make sure to give me time alone. I am very grateful for their consideration.

<b>

"Since Lady Idea, His Majesty, and my companions have gone to such lengths for me, I can't embarrass myself—"

<b>

—I can't.

My attempt to weave such a monologue is interrupted by a gentle knock at the door.

<b>

"Come in."

<b>

After living together for a long time, I can tell who is at the door just by the sound of the knock. This type of knock is undoubtedly from Phenon. I wonder if this skill will ever come in handy.

<b>

"Excuse me. SR-san."

<b>

"Is now a good time? It seems the schedule has been decided, so I thought I would let you know."

<b>

The two who entered were Phenon and Sera.

As soon as they saw my face, they smiled gently.

<b>

"Thanks. I want to hear the details, so please sit down for now."

<b>

I was sitting on the bed, and after guiding them to the sofa, I took a seat on the opposite sofa myself.

<b>

"So, when is it likely to happen?"

<b>

I had conveyed my hope to have ten days for preparation, but I wonder how it turned out.

I expected it would take time for His Majesty to gather the nobles and reach out to various parties, so that much time would be necessary... but I hope they aren't saying it will be tomorrow.

<b>

"It seems we can adjust it for two weeks from now. His Majesty said that if it is difficult for you, we can reschedule, but how does that sound?"

<b>

"I see, then there are no problems. There are limits to what we can do, and it wouldn't be good to leave it for too long."

<b>

Due to something like a barrier, the arena cannot be used—this is not a problem for me, but the tasks I need to do keep lingering in my mind, which is quite uncomfortable.

And more than anything... I wanted to fight 'Moon' with the strength I have gained.

<b>

"Then I will inform my father accordingly. If there is anything you need or are concerned about, please feel free to let us know at any time, okay?"

<b>

Phenon said this, creating a vague smile as if to hide the anxiety deep within her heart.

The reason for this is, needless to say, because of my match with 'Moon'.

<b>

In this past week, I considered running away at least once.

Rather than participating in such a life-and-death match, wouldn't it be better to live quietly somewhere? Shouldn't I choose a more certain and safer strategy?

<b>

"I won't lose, so don't worry."

<b>

However, I did not choose to do so. No, I couldn't choose that.

Running away because the enemy is strong—I could not allow myself to entertain such a soft thought.

<b>

I don't want to run away.

I don't want to lose.

I don't want to give up.

<b>

My principles of action in this world are that simple.

<b>

"If you're scared to watch, it's fine to wait at home, you know?"

<b>

Jokingly saying this, Sera let out a small laugh.

<b>

"I believe in you, SR. Your heart and your strength. ...For now, forget about us as the audience. Once you step into the arena, immerse yourself in your own world. Any unnecessary baggage will be a hindrance. So, focus solely on the fight. If you can exert your full power, there is no way you could lose, no matter what enemy appears."

<b>

With a serious expression, Sera said this, then puffed out her chest with a smug look, glancing at Phenon and me.

I could clearly see the voice in her heart: "I just said something good, right!? You can praise me! Wasn't that cool!?"—and I couldn't help but burst out laughing almost simultaneously with Phenon.

<b>

"Why is that funny? It's more like... I don't know... Anyway, it's different from the reaction I expected."

<b>

"I just thought it was very much like you, Sera."

<b>

"Exactly. It’s true that I was happy, so don’t worry too much about it."

<b>

"I see..."

<b>

Sera pouted in a sulky manner, turning her gaze downward. Like a child.

<b>

Anyway,

<b>

"The decisive battle is in two weeks."
