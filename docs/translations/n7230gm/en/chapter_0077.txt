# 74 Hidden Secrets?

<b>

<b>

<b>

It has been almost a year since I came to this world.

<b>

I don't remember the exact date, but since my status shows I'm still 18, it's clear that not a full year has passed yet.

<b>

By the way, when is my birthday?

<b>

If it's my birthday from my previous life, I would have already turned 19... I wonder if the day I was summoned to this world counts as my birth date.

In any case, back on Earth, once I passed 25, I started thinking, "I've aged another year" every birthday, and since I had no friends to celebrate with, it was certainly not a happy occasion.

<b>

Anyway.

<b>

Since moving close to Reinaas, I've basically been diving into B-rank dungeons with Sera and the others.

On my days off, I either go alone to an A-rank dungeon or spend time shopping with Sera and the others. The latter doesn't take much time, so sometimes we relax together as a group, and other times we each do our own thing.

<b>

And today. The free time from the latter.

<b>

I visited the Explorer's Guild in Reinaas alone and had a mock battle with Lyle, the head of the Explorer's Guild in this town and the younger brother of Regulus, the guild master in the royal capital. I was completely dominating him.

Sera and Phenon seemed to have some errands to run, so they left home before I headed to Reinaas. Of course, Shiri went along with Phenon.

<b>

"I feel like the gap in our abilities has widened..."

<b>

"Well, we are explorers, and we dive into B-rank dungeons almost every day. We’re bound to grow more than Lyle, who is the guild master."

<b>

Lyle, lying on his back in the middle of the training ground, muttered in a voice only I could hear, "You dive into A-rank dungeons too, right?" I looked down at him and smiled to show my agreement.

<b>

Having acquired numerous player bonuses and overwhelmingly surpassing Lyle in status now, there was no chance for him to win against me. If he lost, he would cry. Not in a cool way like a man, but like a baby, bawling his eyes out.

<b>

Since I had already showcased my skills in the martial arts tournament, unlike the last time I had a mock battle with Lyle, I wasn't forcing any explorers out of the training area.

As a result, I noticed a few explorers watching our match. Is it just my imagination, or are the spectators increasing as time goes by?

<b>

That aside.

<b>

"Weren't you supposed to have something to discuss?"

<b>

Before starting the mock battle, he had mentioned to me, "I have something to talk about after this."

When I asked him, Lyle let out a "Well then," with a voice that sounded like he wanted to say it after a few more years, and sat up.

<b>

"I almost forgot in the heat of the match. I got a message from Shin last night; it seems he’s coming to Reinaas soon. He asked me to let SR and the others know."

<b>

The Thunderbolt Brigade is coming to Reinaas? They are contacting us through communication magic tools, so there shouldn't be any issues regarding level-up advice.

<b>

"Oh... I wonder what they are coming for? Did Shin say anything else?"

<b>

"Not particularly. You guys have only been talking through magic tools recently, so I think he just wants to show his face after a while."

<b>

"Hmm... Well, Reinaas is relatively close to the royal capital."

<b>

After all, it's a town that can be reached in half a day by carriage.

If someone from the royal capital wants a change of pace, Reinaas, as a commercial city, might be the perfect place. They probably have a lot of money saved up and are coming for some shopping.

<b>

In any case, since I wanted to consult Shin about Sera and Phenon, this is a convenient development for me. When they come to our house, I'll take the opportunity to discuss things with Shin.

<b>

"So, I've conveyed the message properly."

<b>

As Lyle said this, he placed his hands on the ground and stood up energetically. Then, brushing off the dust from his pants with the hand that wasn't holding a wooden sword, he flashed a combative smile and looked into my eyes.

<b>

Alright, alright. I can tell what you want just by looking into those eyes. Besides,

<b>

"Then how about one more match?"

<b>

He, like Sera, is quite competitive.

<b>

<b>

After breaking Lyle's confidence several times at the guild, I returned home. It was around 7 PM.

<b>

When I got home, it seemed that my party members had already returned. The three of them welcomed me with "Welcome back." As usual, they could have just relaxed in the living room instead of coming all the way to the entrance.

<b>

"I'll take your jacket."

<b>

"Ah, sorry for always bothering you."

<b>

"No problem at all."

<b>

With a smile that seemed to say it was nothing, Shiri took my jacket. As expected of a maid, this simple exchange was so refined that there was no room for criticism. I hope she stays in our home for a long time.

<b>

As I arrived in the living room, Shiri, who had hung up my jacket, said, "I'll prepare dinner right away," and headed to the kitchen. I feel a bit sorry that she is the only one working hard, but if I try to help with housework, she starts to panic, so I try to cover for her in other ways.

<b>

As we sat on the sofa in the living room, Sera asked, "Was the guild master doing well?"

<b>

"He was the same as always. That guy is quite the battle maniac. I had to do mock battles with him multiple times."

<b>

"Hehe, you can't beat SR-san."

<b>

"Is that a compliment?"

<b>

"Of course, it is!"

<b>

It seems she is complimenting me. Then I’ll accept it happily. Yay.

I gave Phenon a brief "Thanks" before changing the subject.

<b>

"By the way, it seems the Thunderbolt Brigade is coming here soon. I don't know the reason, but it might just be for a change of pace."

<b>

When I said this, Phenon and Sera suddenly looked at me and laughed.

Why are they laughing? Did I say something strange?

<b>

Not understanding, I furrowed my brows and tilted my head, and Sera opened her mouth while suppressing her laughter.

<b>

"The Thunderbolt Brigade has a sense of duty, huh... Ah, you don't need to worry about SR."

<b>

"I'm sure Suzu and the others have been feeling lonely being away from us—heh heh."

<b>

Phenon seemed to be holding back laughter just like Sera.

<b>

No, you guys are definitely hiding something. Phenon's words clearly show the feeling of "Just brush it off." If you're going to hide it, at least do it better.

<b>

I don't want to force them to say anything if they don't want to, but... I feel a bit lonely, like I'm being left out.

<b>

"Don't sulk, SR."

<b>

I'm not sulking.

<b>

...I'm not sulking, but somehow I think I'll go help Shiri. I didn't think I wanted to leave this place, but I feel bad leaving all the dinner preparations to Shiri alone, okay? I'm not sulking, alright?

<b>

—Wait, who am I making excuses to?

<b>

As I wandered around behind Shiri, wondering if there was anything I could help with in the kitchen, she sharply told me, "Please sit and wait." Sorry for bothering you.
