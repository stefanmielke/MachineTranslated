# 2 Is that one super easy?

<b>

<b>

<b>

I walked through the palace, sticking close to the beautiful maid, Siri. My anxiety reached its peak, and I couldn't help but ask her a question.

<b>

"Um, am I going to be executed or something?"

<b>

Even if execution was on the table, I knew I wouldn't get a response like, "Yes! We're going to behead you now! Look forward to it!" 

If they said that, I might go on a rampage. But I couldn't help but ask.

<b>

Siri stopped in her tracks and turned to look at me, her eyes wide and her expression blank.

<b>

"That is absolutely impossible. If, by any chance, His Majesty or those around him were to say something like executing the summoned Sir, I would take full responsibility and escort you out of this country. I would humbly accompany you at that time."

<b>

With a gentle smile, she added one more thing.

<b>

"I have no intention of serving a heartless country like that."

<b>

Then she said, "Shall we go?" and turned back to face forward.

Siri is strong.

<b>

Whether it was relief or the touch of her kindness, my eyes naturally became moist.

<b>

Maybe she averted her gaze to avoid seeing my tears.

To affirm that possibility, she simply faced forward and didn't move her feet.

<b>

"…Yes. Let's go."

<b>

Still with her back to me, she nodded and began walking again.

<b>

<b>

The room we were led to was not the audience chamber I had seen when I arrived in this world, but a small room.

Though small, it was about twice the size of a convenience store.

<b>

In the room were the King of Lindale, Zeno, Prime Minister Dino, and two guards who seemed to be part of the royal guard.

<b>

His Majesty the King was sitting comfortably on a luxurious sofa, while Dino stood beside him.

<b>

Looking at them again, they had a different atmosphere than what I had seen in the game.

<b>

The King appeared to be around fifty years old. He had a kind face, yet there was a sense of pressure or oppression about him… it was a presence that made it clear he stood at the pinnacle of the nation.

<b>

The Prime Minister seemed to be slightly younger than the King. Unlike the King's luxurious attire, he wore something more modest—he seemed approachable.

<b>

As we entered the room, His Majesty stood up and addressed me.

<b>

"…Is it Sir SR?"

<b>

When addressed, I instinctively knelt and bowed my head, mimicking what I had seen in manga and anime. I wasn't sure if this was correct, but I responded with "Yes" in that position.

<b>

"Lift your head. This is an informal setting. There is no need for formality."

<b>

Prompted, I lifted my head and slowly stood up.

Thank goodness… it seems I won't be executed for disrespect.

<b>

His Majesty nodded at my demeanor and sat back down on the sofa.

<b>

"First, I want to confirm something. Is it true that you are not a hero? I have heard you are level one and have not chosen a profession."

<b>

"Yes… I apologize for not being the person you expected."

<b>

At my response, His Majesty replied with a disappointed tone, "I see."

Looking at his face, it was filled with a sense of despair that matched his voice. Was there a reason they needed a hero, someone with the power to overcome crises?

<b>

"You do not need to apologize. The one who should be apologizing is us. We forcibly brought you to this unfamiliar world despite knowing you are not a hero. I truly apologize for that."

<b>

"—What!? Please, lift your head!"

<b>

Even as I said that, His Majesty continued to face down.

Looking around for help, I saw that everyone else in the room was bowing deeply.

<b>

Huh… 

<b>

While it seems there is no danger of execution or exile, I still don't know how to handle this situation.

<b>

<b>

After that, Dino joined the conversation and explained the circumstances.

I also shared how I was summoned.

However, it seemed difficult for them to understand, as they had no VR games or even video games, and in the end, it was concluded that I "suddenly jumped to another world while playing." It's not entirely incorrect, which makes it worse.

<b>

I kept the fact that this was the world of that game a secret.

For them, it would be hard to believe that I was a created being, and it wouldn't be easy for them to accept.

<b>

They mentioned that they had used a summoning gem.

That gem apparently came from ancient ruins, along with a tablet that described how to use it and that it could summon a hero.

Of course, it seems there is no gem for returning. However, they promised to search the ruins as a nation.

<b>

It's a secret that I don't want to go back at all.

<b>

The matter of the summoning gem was kept from everyone except the excavators and the nation's dignitaries, but it seemed the royal castle was filled with joy. A hero could be summoned. This was a relief—so they thought.

Because this country was facing a significant problem.

<b>

"The first princess… is ill?"

<b>

"…Yes. According to the doctor, she has about a month left."

<b>

Illness. There was no such element in the ancient ruins or the game.

Perhaps the hero they had been waiting for had the power to cure illnesses. Unfortunately, I don't possess such power. I could only say something like, "Pain, pain, go away."

<b>

"Sir SR, I ask that you keep this matter confidential. It would cause confusion among the citizens. We thought it was dishonest not to tell you the reason for your summoning."

<b>

"Of course, Dino. By the way, is there no other way to save the princess besides summoning a hero?"

<b>

In response to my words, Dino placed his hand on his chin and furrowed his brow.

<b>

"We need a hero—not just any hero, but someone very strong. You see, to save the princess, we need the legendary elixir."

<b>

"—What!? The elixir!?"

<b>

Is that the same elixir? I definitely remember it dropping in dungeons in the game.

<b>

"From your reaction, it seems the elixir existed in the world you came from?"

<b>

"N-no. I knew of it as knowledge, but…"

<b>

I can't say I know about this world because I can't explain the game to them, and besides, I have no certainty that the game and this world are exactly the same. The existence of illness already indicates a difference from the game.

<b>

If only my item inventory from before my reincarnation had remained intact… I had over a thousand elixirs stocked.

<b>

"Is it difficult to obtain the elixir?"

<b>

I asked a particularly concerning question during the conversation.

<b>

After all, obtaining the elixir in Tempest was incredibly easy.

The method was that the boss of a B-rank dungeon would drop it for sure. It wasn't as difficult as an S-rank dungeon, nor was there any probability involved.

<b>

However, the elixir had the restriction that once used, it couldn't be used again for the next hour. In terms of usability, the high-grade potion was definitely better.

<b>

In response to my question, His Majesty answered in a heavy voice.

<b>

"According to the kingdom's history books, it is recorded that about 300 years ago, a dungeon boss dropped it. If that record is true, it is nearly impossible now."

<b>

A dungeon boss drop… this seems similar to the game.

Could it be that the elixir drops in an SS-rank dungeon where the Demon King Venom resides in this world?

If that's the case, it would indeed be nearly impossible.

<b>

His Majesty clenched his fist and slammed it down on the armrest of the sofa, his face contorted in frustration.

<b>

<b>

"—Damn it! Traversing a B-rank dungeon is… not impossible!"

<b>

<b>

…Huh?

<b>

…Huh?

<b>

Did you just say B-rank?

<b>

Isn't that super easy?

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

As an apology for summoning me due to the country's circumstances, I received 100,000 orls. In terms of the game, that's about 1 million yen. An unexpected windfall. Yay!

<b>

Additionally, they said that if I ever found myself in need of money, I could come to the royal castle anytime, and they even offered me a room in the castle as a place to live. I could see that it would become suffocating, so I politely declined.

<b>

Finally, they handed me a dagger with the royal crest. I was told to use it if I ever found myself in trouble with nobles.

Should I say something like, "Do you not see this crest?" I won't, though.

<b>

Then, the King made one request of me.

<b>

<b>

"It is a pleasure to meet you, Princess."

<b>

I knelt and spoke.

She was lying on the bed, and with the help of her maid, she propped herself up.

Her silky, pure white hair flowed smoothly. She looked to be around 15 years old.

<b>

"Please lift your head. You are the hero, correct?"

<b>

She tilted her head cutely and smiled. So adorable. She looked just like a doll.

Speaking of which, do I need to introduce myself first in situations like this?

<b>

"…Yes. I am SR. I am the hero who came from another world to save you."

<b>

Saying it myself, I felt embarrassed!

What do you mean, "I am the hero!"? I'm just a NEET!

<b>

What I was asked by His Majesty and those around him was precisely this.

They wanted me to pretend to be a hero and reassure the princess. I decided to accept this request, as I felt this lie was one I could tell.

<b>

Holding back my embarrassment, I looked at the princess's expression.

She wore a vague smile. It couldn't be called a full smile. Given that she was ill, it was understandable.

<b>

"I am Fenon. I suppose my father and the others asked you, but please don't overdo it. I worry about you."

<b>

It seems she was concerned about me.

Even though she must be suffering herself, she is worried about others… what a kind girl.

<b>

"No! I am the hero! Traversing a B-rank dungeon is a piece of cake!"

<b>

I thumped my chest and flashed a cool smile. I'm not sure if I did it well.

However, even though I said it was a piece of cake, the truth is, it's a bit tough.

<b>

While traversing a B-rank dungeon is easy, that only applies if I have "time." The one-month time limit weighs heavily now.

What's strange is why the inhabitants of this world, who should have had time, are stumbling over a mere B-rank dungeon.

<b>

I guess there's no point in thinking about that now.

<b>

The princess wore another vague smile in response to my bravado.

A hint of a troubled or sad emotion seemed to flicker in her expression.

<b>

Since the hero is saying he will help, she should be more joyful… I wonder why? I don't understand.

<b>

Not wanting to overstay my welcome, and thinking I shouldn't touch the princess's body, I decided to say one last thing, my sincere words, and then take my leave.

<b>

I stopped my serious expression and, with a gentle smile as if soothing a child, said, "It will be alright."

For some reason, the princess looked surprised, but I continued speaking without caring.

<b>

<b>

I'm not a hero.

<b>

I'm not the hero you all wished for.

<b>

I'm level one, with no profession, and I have nothing.

<b>

<b>

"I will definitely save you."

<b>

I am a man who once reigned at the top of a world very similar to this one.
