# A-97 Strength of Crescent and Jade

<b>

<b>

<b>

The S-rank dungeon in the Rezel Kingdom is located about two hours by carriage from the royal capital.

I hadn’t decided anything in advance and was vaguely thinking that everyone would go together, but at that moment, Jade offered her opinion.

<b>

“Can I and Mika take care of it?”

<b>

Mika is the other name for Crescent as called by Jade. For a moment, I was confused and recalled the time when I was playing Tempest. It’s not that I have any trauma from remembering, but… others might look puzzled.

<b>

“Hm? Are you talking about the boss battle? Well, I think it doesn’t matter who does it, so it’s fine.”

<b>

“No, I mean not just the boss battle, but the entire strategy—”

<b>

When I listened more closely, it seemed that Jade wanted to establish a stable position in this world as soon as possible. I understand that she doesn’t want to be underestimated, and the fact that she’s acting with us means she’s inevitably standing out.

<b>

“I see.”

<b>

The boss of this S-rank dungeon is the Gale Dragon.

The dungeon is structured like a cave, but it is spacious enough for a dragon about thirty meters long to fly.

<b>

I was about to openly express my desire to go to the dungeon… but as an older person and a senior in this other world, I decided to yield.

Regarding the Gale Dragon, I had fought more than enough before challenging Venom.

At that time, I was fighting multiple bosses, so it would definitely feel bland now, so I’ll hold back.

<b>

It’s almost impossible for Crescent and Jade to struggle in the dungeon, so worrying about it would be pointless. For them, there are no threats in this world.

<b>

<b>

After discussing that while strolling through the town, we returned to the royal castle.

It seemed that Fenon and the others were also discussing the S-rank dungeon, and a meeting began with us included. The nostalgic Vinzet siblings were also there, but before I knew it, Noah had disappeared somewhere. She ran away.

<b>

Although she didn’t seem to have a good relationship with her sister Jill, Noah probably didn’t care much about it. After all, from the perspective of a god, it might feel like being bitten by an ant.

<b>

“So, I decided to have Jade and Crescent go to the S-rank dungeon—but is it better to take someone from Rezel if reporting is a hassle?”

<b>

Since I had heard from the king that “if possible, provide information,” I asked Crescent and the others.

<b>

“Ah, if possible, that would help. I hate paperwork.”

<b>

“I don’t have much confidence in this kind of experience either…”

<b>

So, I conveyed the request for someone from the Rezel side to Kataliya, the second princess, and the Vinzet siblings.

—However,

<b>

“Are these two really strong? The place they’re going to is an S-rank dungeon, you know?”

<b>

Sister Jill looked at Crescent and Jade as if evaluating them.

But the two seemed surprisingly unfazed. Even though the other party was nobility, this was a discussion in their area of expertise. There’s still a bit of a nervous atmosphere around nobles sometimes, but… Ah, they might want achievements quickly so they don’t feel scared in such situations.

<b>

Achievements that would be known not just domestically but also in other countries.

When Jill asked, everyone’s gaze turned towards us.

Sera, Fenon, and Shiri were also present, but they didn’t seem to be interrupting much.

Why is it that I feel like I’m the one who has to explain?

<b>

“I think it would be fine to show them in an actual battle, but I believe Jill and Arnold would understand even if I explained it verbally.”

<b>

“Are you saying I wouldn’t understand?”

<b>

Lady Kataliya said with a glare. It felt like she was half teasing, but it was a bit scary, so I wanted her to stop.

<b>

“Lady Kataliya hasn’t seen me fight, right? So I thought it might be hard to understand the comparison.”

<b>

As I responded with a wry smile, Arnold opened his mouth this time.

<b>

“So, what does that mean? I want you to explain it clearly.”

<b>

At Arnold’s words, Jill nodded in agreement.

Yeah, I think these two would understand if I brought up that story.

The easiest way to demonstrate the strength of Crescent and Jade is to compare them to me.

<b>

“Previously, Arnold and the others came to Lindell and fought with me, right? You still remember that, don’t you?”

<b>

When I asked, they both replied in unison, “Of course” and “There’s no way I could forget.”

<b>

“It’s embarrassing to say it myself, but—didn’t you think there was quite a gap between my strength and that of the Thunderbolt’s trajectories?”

<b>

“I don’t want to admit it, but there’s a huge difference.”

<b>

The reason she doesn’t want to admit it is probably because she has experienced losing to the Thunderbolt’s trajectories.

Jill and the others seem to be working hard to level up their new professions, but they still seem far from catching up to the Thunderbolt’s trajectories.

The real competition will be after all stats are maxed out.

<b>

“Crescent and Jade—these two can be considered almost as strong as me.”

<b>

Since we are from the same hometown, I said it as if I were boasting about my children.

Then,

<b>

“I object! I don’t want to be compared to Esuar!”

<b>

“I also object. I still feel like I can’t catch up to your back.”

<b>

Isn’t this a moment where they should be supporting my statement?
