# 62 Can I Live Together!?

<b>

<b>

<b>

Despite the king of the country clearing his schedule just for me, the person in question is off exploring the dungeon freely, shouting "Yahhoo!"—of course, that’s not the case.

<b>

It’s impossible, obviously. He’s the king, after all. It’s not the same as being called by a boss.

<b>

<b>

“Do not be so stiff. Today, I wanted to have a calm discussion with you, Sir SR.”

<b>

“That’s right. I haven’t heard much about your world either.”

<b>

One of the reception rooms in the royal castle.

<b>

On the enormous sofa across from me sits King Zeno, and on the sofa to my right is the Prime Minister, Dino.

<b>

Speaking of which, once the matter with the princess is settled, he mentioned discussing Earth. I completely forgot about that.

<b>

“I apologize if my choice of words has been rude. I will do my best to be careful.”

<b>

As I shrink my body to the limit and bow my head, the king replied, “You need not worry about it.”

And then he immediately asked me a serious question.

<b>

“Since you were summoned to this world, Sir SR— the B-rank dungeon has been conquered, and advanced classes have been discovered. Until then, even the light of hope was vague, you know? Is it true that the one who discovered the advanced class is the Thunderbolt’s Trail?”

<b>

He suddenly brought up a difficult topic.

<b>

His sharp gaze makes me feel like a frog caught in a snake's stare.

It’s not like I’m actually being glared at or threatened with a knife, but the weight of the king’s presence naturally makes my body tense up.

<b>

It would be easy to simply answer, “It’s the Thunderbolt’s Trail,” but I missed my timing, creating an awkward pause.

<b>

At that moment, Dino quickly extended a helping hand.

<b>

“Your Majesty, if you apply that kind of pressure, Sir SR won’t be able to respond.”

<b>

“Hmm, that was not my intention.”

<b>

Seeing the king with a troubled expression, Dino shrugged.

<b>

“Your Majesty unconsciously intimidates others. Please consciously relax. I think it would be better if you spoke a bit more gently during discussions with other countries as well.”

<b>

Dino spoke in a tone that seemed exasperated.

Is the king being scolded? By the Prime Minister?

<b>

“I understand. I apologize, Sir SR.”

<b>

“Oh, no, please don’t mind me…”

<b>

Trying to soften the atmosphere, the king slightly raised the corners of his mouth. I bowed my head in response.

It certainly became easier to talk, but that’s not because the king’s expression changed. It’s because I witnessed Dino scolding him.

Somehow, the king felt much closer to me.

<b>

“—The one who discovered it is the Thunderbolt’s Trail. I had some combat experience, so I merely assisted them.”

<b>

When I answered, the king chuckled softly, “Heh.”

<b>

“There’s no way someone with only a bit of combat experience could fight like that. The martial arts tournament was impressive. There’s no one left in this country who doubts your strength.”

<b>

“Well… it was a one against many, so they probably went easy on me.”

<b>

“It didn’t look that way to me.”

<b>

“Hahaha…”

<b>

How should I respond, damn it.

Hey, can someone give me a manual for dealing with royalty? Urgently.

<b>

<b>

After that, with Dino joining in, we discussed dungeon exploration, drop items, and the appropriate price for elixirs.

Apparently, they have already received several elixirs from the Thunderbolt’s Trail, and the country is unsure how much to pay.

<b>

Shin and the others probably aren’t short on money, and they know that conquering the B-rank dungeon will eventually be possible for other explorers too. Even if I set the price myself, there shouldn’t be any complaints.

For now, I proposed ten times the shop price at Tempest—200,000 Orl. In terms of real-world currency, that’s about 2 million yen.

<b>

Even so, both of them raised their voices, saying it was too cheap, but I actually think it’s too high. For someone like me who can do two rounds a day, a daily wage of 4 million yen is guaranteed.

<b>

However, while the quantity is still low, I want the country to manage it properly to prevent stockpiling. I decided to leave how much to distribute to other countries up to the country’s policy. I don’t think they’ll do anything bad.

<b>

“How about Fenon? Is she enjoying herself as an explorer?”

<b>

Once I finished broadly discussing Earth, the king gently asked.

<b>

“Yes. I get along well with Sera, and there’s also Shiri.”

<b>

“Fufu, the main reason is that you’re with Sir SR. It’s wonderful that she has become more cheerful, but Fenon is a bit too much of a tomboy. Please keep an eye on her.”

<b>

“Of course. I do have her do combat training from time to time, but basically, I have her step back.”

<b>

“Oh? That girl is doing combat training? …Well, if Sir SR and Sera Bernot are there, I suppose there’s no need to worry.”

<b>

Saying that, the king picked up a cup of tea from the table.

<b>

Since the king has started to show a more relaxed atmosphere, I think it’s about time to bring up my main topic.

<b>

“Actually, I plan to move my base to the city of Renus for a while.”

<b>

The king, who was about to bring the cup to his lips, suddenly stopped.

<b>

“If Sir SR and Sera Bernot are going, then Fenon will probably go too.”

<b>

“Yes, I haven’t confirmed with her yet, but I think my stay in Renus will be long-term, and I don’t want to say goodbye to her here, so I would like her to come with me if possible. Also… it’s more efficient for party members to live in the same house…”

<b>

I muddled through my words, trying to say, “Hey, can I live together with your daughter!?”

<b>

It seemed the king quickly understood what I was trying to say, as he wore a teasing smile.

<b>

“Explorers often live in the same house. Normally, it wouldn’t even be allowed to become an explorer, but Fenon has lost a lot of time due to illness— I will allow that degree of freedom. However, no cohabitation until the ceremony, understood?”

<b>

“Of course! Regarding the engagement… I’m considering it positively, but please give me a little more time.”

<b>

“Fufu, that’s fine. However, judging by your reaction, it seems Fenon has successfully captured Sir SR’s heart. I entrust my daughter to you.”

<b>

The king, no longer just a monarch but a father, smiled gently and took a sip of his tea, looking relieved. Perhaps he had been concerned about his daughter’s romantic situation.

<b>

Even though he is a king, he’s still just a human like us… As I pondered this, Dino interjected into the conversation, saying, “By the way…”

<b>

“According to reports, it seems that Fenon and the others have been entering the B-rank dungeon in Renus for some time now. Isn’t that dangerous?”

<b>

Oh, so they really have been keeping an eye on us.

Or did Drag report it? Either way, it doesn’t matter.

<b>

“There’s no problem. Shiri has also become stronger, and even the princess, who is the least experienced in combat, can now defeat monsters in the lower levels of C-rank dungeons on her own.”

<b>

“Bwah—”

<b>

The king choked.

<b>

He forcefully expelled the tea from his mouth, spreading a pleasant mist throughout the room like an aroma humidifier. Although, the damage to me, sitting directly across from him, was significant.

<b>

That’s disgusting! I was immediately overwhelmed with the urge to wipe my face, but realizing it would be rude, I held back. I smiled and asked, “Are you okay?” In truth, I wanted to hear those words directed at me.

<b>

“Wha, wha, what? Fenon defeated the monsters in the lower levels of a C-rank dungeon by herself?”

<b>

Would it be disrespectful to ask if his dentures fell out? Of course, I don’t have the courage to say something like that.

<b>

“If it seems dangerous, I provide support.”

<b>

Fenon’s movements are light, and her magic accuracy is quite good.

While she doesn’t have outstanding talent, she possesses enough athletic ability to function adequately as an explorer.

If we correct the dangerous parts, she should be able to thrive as a rear guard.

<b>

“Sir SR is indeed terrifying… Or could it be that Fenon has hidden talents—?”

<b>

With a thoughtful expression, the king and the prime minister fell silent.

I don’t know what they’re thinking, but I want to shout out loud.

<b>

<b>

Hurry up and bring me a towel.
