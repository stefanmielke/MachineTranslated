# 63 Different Ways of Addressing Each Other

<b>

<b>

<b>

Having finished my discussion with His Majesty and Dino, I headed straight back to my house located on the same premises.

As I opened the front door, I could hear the familiar voices of the women speaking.

<b>

I guess they heard the sound of the door opening and closing. Soon, Phenon rushed over, followed slowly by Sera and Shilly.

<b>

“Welcome back, SR-sama!”

<b>

Somehow, it felt like a puppy was eagerly waiting for its owner to come home. I imagined a tail wagging energetically.

<b>

“I've just returned, Phenon. So you all were here after all.”

<b>

Although no one was home when I left, it seemed they had gathered while I was at the royal castle. It’s common for them to come over even on their days off.

<b>

“I'll brew some drinks right away. Is coffee alright?”

<b>

“Yes, please. Thank you.”

<b>

Hearing my response, Shilly bowed respectfully and headed towards the kitchen.

I know it's not my place to say, but I'd feel more comfortable if she would be a bit more casual. It would be nice if she could accept that.

<b>

Speaking of casual, it's Phenon.

<b>

While the title changed from "Hero-sama" to "SR-sama," she still calls me with the honorific.

Is that really appropriate for partners working together? What happened to our statuses? Isn’t she the first princess!?

If anyone hears her, the likelihood of my peaceful days being disrupted increases significantly.

<b>

“How was your conversation with His Majesty?”

<b>

Sera asked as we headed to the living room.

<b>

“I talked about the progress of the dungeon and some stories from the world I was in before. Also discussed the pricing of elixirs.”

<b>

“I see... The difficulty of obtaining them has certainly changed from before. By the way, what amount did you propose for the elixirs, SR?”

<b>

“For now, I said 200,000 Orl. Just so you know, this is still a high price in my opinion.”

<b>

“I can picture Father being astonished by that amount. However, if that price gets us elixirs, there will be many lives saved, like mine.”

<b>

“Yes, I hope it turns out that way too. If derivative secondary jobs spread in this world and tertiary jobs become the norm, they should be available at more reasonable prices.”

<b>

“I hope so... I really do wish for that.”

<b>

Sera murmured solemnly.

Having worked tirelessly to save Phenon, she probably understands the value more deeply than anyone.

<b>

As I glanced at Sera's expression, Phenon changed the topic.

<b>

“By the way, didn't you discuss anything else?”

<b>

With a cheerful smile, she gazed directly into my eyes.

<b>

I felt like she was probing into my heart.

She probably isn't thinking that way, but since I had a conversation about my future with her with His Majesty, it made me feel that way.

<b>

“N-No. Nothing in particular.”

<b>

“Did you discuss the engagement between me and SR-sama?”

<b>

Her pinpoint question caught me off guard. I frantically shook my head.

Before confirming with her, I was worried that saying, “I got permission from my parents to live together,” might trigger something forceful.

<b>

“Was it about the engagement?”

<b>

I continued to shake my head. Although I had tidied myself up to go to the royal castle, my hair was instantly back to being messy.

She was like a prosecutor while I was the defendant. Could someone please defend me?

<b>

Looking at Sera with the feeling of wanting to borrow even a cat’s paw, I saw that she was directing her gaze towards Phanon. And Phanon, who was at the end of that gaze, was also looking at Sera.

It seemed that the two were exchanging some kind of eye contact. They were nodding at each other as if they understood something.

<b>

I have no idea what the two of them are thinking. Could it be that they both can read my mind? … No way.

<b>

Shilly brought drinks for everyone, including herself, and sat on the sofa. I and Sera had coffee, while Phenon and Shilly had tea.

She took a sip of the tea and relaxed with a sigh.

<b>

Now all party members had gathered in the living room.

Perhaps sensing my eagerness to talk, there was no idle chatter.

<b>

“Before we discuss future matters, Phenon, Shilly.”

<b>

When I called their names, they both replied “Yes.”

I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and slowly opened my mouth.

<b>

"We're risking our lives together. I want to get closer to both of you. First, I’d like to change how we address each other—starting with our speech. What do you think?"

<b>

Before getting permission, I took the initiative. I quickly dropped the honorifics.

Though it seems rude to the first princess, I was fully aware she wouldn't get upset over something like this. In fact, she—

<b>

“I'm delighted!!”

<b>

She responded just as I imagined she would.

<b>

Even though Phenon is disguised, if I, who have received a title and improved my status, behaved humbly, it might raise suspicions about her identity. This change is not only about comfort but also a necessary measure.

<b>

As for Shilly, having lived with honorifics for so long, it seemed difficult for her to speak casually, making her feel more tired.

<b>

<b>

Ultimately, I changed how I address them, and Shilly and Phenon decided to switch from "SR-sama" to "SR-san." I wouldn’t mind if they just called me by my name, but that will come later.

<b>

Once they get used to it, Phenon says she might change her tone too. In her words, I would consider it “a warm welcome.”

<b>

“Don't I get anything?”

<b>

While we were having a lively discussion, Sera, feeling left out, pouted and voiced her dissatisfaction.

<b>

“Because Sera already calls everyone by their names, right?”

<b>

What more should I do?

<b>

“That may be true, but... —Ah! Does SR not have a nickname? Something only close friends or, you know, a romantic partner would use?”

<b>

I’ve never had a girlfriend! Are you being sarcastic!?

<b>

As for nicknames, back in school, I used to be called “Riku” or “Shuu,” but my current name is “SR,” which already feels like a nickname.

<b>

For some reason, Sera became awkward and fidgety, squeezing her hands between her knees.

<b>

When I told her that I didn’t have a special nickname, she fell her shoulders in disappointment.

<b>

“Um... If it's not a bother, can I call you ‘SR-san’ just like the others?”

<b>

Having thought it over, Shilly threw that question to Sera. Instantly, Sera's expression brightened. You’re so simple-minded.

<b>

“Of course! You can call me by name too!”

<b>

“No, that’s—Ah, I’ll go brew new drinks now.”

<b>

With a wry smile, Shilly headed toward the kitchen. No, she was escaping.

<b>

While I may not have the skill to dodge conversational topics, her way of avoiding them is very instructive.

<b>

Next time I’m in trouble, I’ll try it out—thinking this as I watched Shilly's retreating figure.
