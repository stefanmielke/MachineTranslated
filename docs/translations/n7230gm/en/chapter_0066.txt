# 63 Different Ways of Addressing Each Other

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing my conversation with His Majesty and Dino, I headed straight home to my house located on the same premises.

As I opened the front door, I heard the familiar voices of the women.

<b>

I guess they heard the sound of the door opening. Soon, Fenon came running up, followed slowly by Sera and Shiri.

<b>

"Welcome back, Esuar-sama!"

<b>

Somehow, it felt like a puppy was eagerly waiting for its master to return. I could almost see a hallucination of a tail wagging excitedly.

<b>

"I've just returned, Fenon. So you all were here after all."

<b>

Although the house was empty when I left, it seems they gathered while I was at the royal castle. It's usual for them to come over even on days off.

<b>

"I'll prepare some drinks right away. Is coffee alright?"

<b>

"Yes, please."

<b>

Upon my reply, Shiri bowed respectfully and headed towards the kitchen.

Though it's not my place to say, I would feel more comfortable if she were a bit more casual. I hope she would be okay with that.

<b>

Speaking of casualness, it's Fenon.

<b>

Even though the way of addressing me changed from "Hero-sama" to "Esuar-sama," she still calls me with the honorific "sama."

Is that really appropriate for someone who is a member of the same team? What about her status? She's the first princess, after all!

If anyone around were to hear that, the chances of my peaceful days being disrupted would increase significantly.

<b>

"How was your talk with His Majesty?"

<b>

Sera asked as we headed towards the living room.

<b>

"We talked about the progress in the dungeon and about the world I used to be in. Also, we discussed the price of elixirs."

<b>

"I see... Indeed, the difficulty of obtaining them has changed from before. By the way, how much did you propose for the elixirs, Esuar?"

<b>

"For now, 200,000 Orl. Just so you know, I think that's quite high already."

<b>

"I can almost picture my father being dumbfounded. But if that amount can get elixirs, then many lives like mine will be saved."

<b>

"That's right. I hope it turns out that way. If derivative secondary jobs spread in this world and tertiary jobs become common, they should be obtainable at more reasonable prices."

<b>

"I hope so... I really wish for that."

<b>

Sera murmured thoughtfully.

Having been dedicated to saving Fenon, she might understand the value of that more than anyone else.

<b>

As I glanced at Sera's expression, Fenon switched the topic.

<b>

"By the way, didn't you talk about anything else?"

<b>

With a cheerful expression, she looked straight into my eyes.

<b>

I felt like she was probing into my heart.

She probably wasn't thinking about that at all, but because I had discussed my future with her with His Majesty, it made me feel that way.

<b>

"N-no, not particularly."

<b>

"Did you talk about me and Esuar-sama?"

<b>

That was a bit too pinpointed. I hurriedly shook my head.

Before confirming with her, I was worried that if I said something like, "I got permission from my parents to live together," it might trigger some sort of forceful reaction.

<b>

"Was it about engagement?"

<b>

I continued shaking my head. I had tidied myself up to go to the royal castle, but my hair had quickly returned to a messy state.

She was like a prosecutor, and I was the defendant. Is there anyone who can defend me?

<b>

Feeling like I wanted to borrow even a cat's paw, I looked at Sera, who was directing her gaze towards Fenon. Fenon was also looking at Sera.

It seemed like they were exchanging some kind of eye contact. They nodded at each other as if they understood something.

<b>

I have no idea what those two are thinking. Could it be that they can read my mind? ...No way.

<b>

Shiri brought drinks for everyone, including herself, into the living room and sat on the sofa. I and Sera had coffee, while Fenon and Shiri had tea.

She took a sip of her tea and relaxed, letting out a sigh of relief.

<b>

Now, all the party members had gathered in the living room.

Perhaps I was giving off a vibe that I wanted to talk, as there was no small talk.

<b>

"Before we discuss future plans, Fenon, Shiri."

<b>

When I called their names, they both replied with "Yes."

I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and slowly opened my mouth.

<b>

"We're risking our lives working together. I want to become closer to both of you. First, I want to change how we address each other—and our speech as well. What do you both think?"

<b>

Before getting their permission, I took the initiative. I immediately dropped the honorifics.

While I thought it might be rude to the first princess, I was well aware that she wouldn't mind something like this. In fact, she—

<b>

"I'm all for it!!"

<b>

She responded with joy. It was the reaction I had imagined in my mind.

Even though Fenon was in disguise, if I were to act subservient after receiving a title and elevating my status, people might start to wonder who she really was. This is not only about improving comfort but also a necessary measure.

<b>

As for Shiri, perhaps because she had lived with honorifics for so long, she found it difficult to speak casually and ended up feeling more tired.

<b>

<b>

In the end, I changed my way of speaking and how I addressed them, while Shiri and Fenon changed how they addressed me from "Esuar-sama" to "Esuar-san." I wouldn't mind if they called me by my name without any honorifics, but that can come later.

<b>

Once they get used to it, Fenon said she would also change her way of speaking. To borrow her words, I would say, "I'm all for it."

<b>

"Don't I get anything?"

<b>

As we were having a lively discussion, Sera, who had been completely left out, pouted and raised her voice in dissatisfaction.

<b>

"But Sera already calls everyone by their names without honorifics, right?"

<b>

What more do you want me to do?

<b>

"That's true, but...—Ah! That's it! Don't you have a nickname, Esuar!? Something that only close friends or, um, a girlfriend would call you?"

<b>

I've never had a girlfriend! Are you being sarcastic!?

<b>

As for nicknames, during my school days, I was called "Riku" or "Shuu," but my current name is "Esuar," which is already kind of a nickname.

<b>

Unconsciously cutting through people's hearts, Sera suddenly became fidgety, placing her hands between her knees.

<b>

Wondering why, I told her that I didn't have a particular nickname, and she sighed, "I see."

<b>

"Um... If it's not too much trouble, may I also call you Sera-sama with the same 'san' suffix as Esuar-san?"

<b>

Perhaps trying to be considerate, Shiri threw those words at Sera. Instantly, Sera's expression brightened. You're so simple-minded.

<b>

"Of course! You can call me without honorifics too!"

<b>

"No, that's—Ah, I'll go make some fresh drinks."

<b>

With a wry smile, Shiri headed towards the kitchen. No, she was escaping.

<b>

Aside from physically avoiding the situation, her method of evading conversation is very educational for me, who lacks such skills.

<b>

Maybe I'll try it out next time I'm in trouble—while watching Shiri's retreating figure, I thought about that.
