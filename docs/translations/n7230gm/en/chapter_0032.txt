# Casual Talk - Celebration

This is a casual talk before entering Chapter Two ^^*

----------------

<b>

<b>

“““““Cheers!””””””

<b>

The voices of five people overlapped, and the glasses they raised clinked together.

<b>

The noble district spreads out surrounding the royal castle.

In that place, there was a small tavern that was set up in a corner, not too conspicuous.

The name of the tavern was 'Barto.' It was a place favored by nobles, as Serah had informed us, and we were celebrating our 'B-rank dungeon conquest' there.

<b>

The long table could seat five on one side, with a sunken kotatsu type where we could rest our feet. A menu in the shape of a hanging scroll was affixed to the heavy dark brown wooden wall.

To my left was Serah, and across from me, centered around Shin, were the members of the Thunderbolt party.

<b>

Shin and Serah ordered ale, while I ordered barley tea, Laika ordered wine, and Suzu, who apparently couldn’t drink alcohol, asked for peach juice.

It’s unclear whether she can’t drink because she’s underage or if she’s just not good with alcohol despite being an adult. Asking about age is a breach of etiquette, after all.

<b>

“By the way, how old is SR?”

<b>

Hey! You’re asking that now?!

<b>

In response to Suzu’s question, I took a sip of barley tea to wet my throat and answered, “I’m 18.”

Now that I think about it, I don’t know the legal drinking age in this world. Is it the same as my original world, 20 years old?

<b>

“Is 18 the legal age to drink alcohol in this world?”

<b>

Curious, I asked right away. Regardless, I don’t plan on drinking.

In my previous world, I really disliked drinking alcohol for work-related socializing. At first, I was treated like someone who couldn’t read the room if I didn’t order beer. Who cares about reading the room, idiot.

<b>

“You can drink from 18. Are you not good with alcohol, SR?”

<b>

“I’m not good at it, are you, Suzu?”

<b>

“Yes, I am. It makes my head spin.”

<b>

Suzu said this while making a gesture of shaking her head back and forth.

Hmm… So Suzu is at least 18 or older. Her appearance could easily be mistaken for someone under 18. She looks that young.

<b>

As we were having such trivial conversations, Shin interrupted.

<b>

“What are you two talking about? I thought you were older because you seem so composed.”

<b>

Laika chimed in, agreeing with Shin.

Wait… Am I looking old?

If I were still 33, that would make sense, but I’m a pretty handsome 18 now, right? This must be some mistake.

<b>

To avoid drawing the ire of the women, I tried to direct my gaze toward Shin and asked, “How old are you all?”

<b>

The first to respond to my question was Serah, sitting next to me. She puffed out her chest as if to say, “How about that?”

<b>

“I’m 22.”

<b>

I know. I asked before.

<b>

“I’m 27.”

<b>

“25.”

<b>

“I’m 26.”

<b>

Following suit, Shin, Suzu, and Laika answered in turn.

<b>

I had somewhat expected Shin to be in his mid-20s.

Thinking about it, there’s almost a decade between us now. I brought up the topic of “conditions for apprenticeship” to someone that far apart in age. That’s a bit presumptuous of me.

<b>

The women were older than I had imagined.

<b>

Suzu had bobbed light blue hair. There was a character with similar hair in an anime I watched long ago. That character was set at 15 years old, and combined with her short stature, which could easily let me rest my chin on her head, I had apparently estimated her to be quite young in my mind.

<b>

On the other hand, Laika looked like she could be a college student.

With her long brown hair and attire that wasn’t overly fantasy-like, if she wore a regular shirt and skirt, she could easily blend in attending college lectures on Earth.

<b>

Noticing my hesitance regarding age, Laika spoke with a gentle expression.

<b>

“Explorers are judged by their abilities. Status doesn’t matter, and age matters even less. So you don’t have to worry about that, Master.”

<b>

“M-master? What’s with that title?!”

<b>

Being told that suddenly was shocking!

<b>

“Because you’re going to make us your apprentices, right? Isn’t it natural to call you that?”

<b>

“No, no, I’ll give advice to help you get stronger, but please keep calling me as you have been. I just used the term ‘apprentice’ because I couldn’t think of another way to express it; it’s fine if you just call me a friend or something.”

<b>

Besides, if others hear it, it would be a huge problem. Being the master of the top party in the country would definitely attract attention. Please keep it confidential.

<b>

“Then it’s strange to speak to a friend like that, isn’t it?”

<b>

Shin said while shaking the ice in his glass. He didn’t seem drunk, but he had a cheerful expression.

<b>

Speaking style, huh… 

The reason I’m speaking to them with honorifics isn’t because they’re older or of a higher status; it’s a kind of wall saying, “Don’t step too close.” I stop using honorifics when I feel I can get closer to someone.

<b>

“...I understand. But don’t complain later.”

<b>

In other words, I’m fine with them.

They’re the ones with whom I share secrets and hardships.

<b>

At my words, Shin, followed by Suzu, Laika, and Serah next to me, all exclaimed, “Oh!” It’s embarrassing, so please stop.

<b>

“It feels really refreshing. Please speak to me like that too.”

<b>

“Yeah. In fact, it seems like we should be using honorifics toward you, given the difference in abilities… But I’m not good at polite speech, so just close your eyes to it.”

<b>

“Yes, yes. I’m looking forward to your advice, SR.”

<b>

It seems the other three, besides Shin, don’t want to use honorifics either. I don’t mind either way, but if they want to speak casually, then I’ll go along with it.

<b>

<b>

We enjoyed the dishes that were brought to us while engaging in lively conversation. We talked about our experiences in the dungeon, our favorite and least favorite foods, recommended clothing and weapon shops, and the topics were diverse.

<b>

It’s been a while since I’ve felt such a relaxed atmosphere. I can’t even remember how many years it’s been; it’s too bothersome to recall. It’s different from family gatherings and, of course, different from workplace drinking parties.

<b>

I felt happy—something I hadn’t felt outside of games in a long time.

<b>

“—Hey, Serah. This isn’t your home, you know.”

<b>

Three hours had already passed since we toasted.

The dishes on the table had disappeared, and now there were only five half-full glasses left.

<b>

As we talked, I had completely gotten used to the relaxed tone.

This was thanks to the fact that my original age was 33 and that they spoke to me normally without teasing me.

It was a bit difficult to drop the honorifics from their names, but the atmosphere made it feel natural quickly.

<b>

I tapped Serah’s shoulder, who was swaying gently.

She opened her eyes wide for a moment but quickly squinted again. She was too defenseless.

<b>

“Ah, ah, you’ve drunk too much. SR, you better take care of her.”

<b>

Shin said with an exasperated tone. He and Laika seemed to be strong drinkers, having consumed nearly ten cups without showing any signs of intoxication.

<b>

“Why me? Shouldn’t it be Laika or Suzu, who are both women?”

<b>

“Serah’s your responsibility, right?”

<b>

“Yes, yes.”

<b>

What do you mean responsibility… When did that get decided?

<b>

Glancing at Serah, who was the center of the conversation, she seemed completely oblivious to our discussion, swaying back and forth as if she were asleep sitting up.

<b>

“She’s been tense because of the princess. Cut her some slack today.”

<b>

Shin said with a wry smile.

Indeed, she had been desperate to save the princess. She must have been more mentally strained than anyone else here.

But—

<b>

“That’s a separate issue, isn’t it?”

<b>

Why am I the one responsible for Serah? It doesn’t matter who worked hard.

As I frowned, Laika rested her chin on her hand and said with a smirk.

<b>

“Picky men aren’t popular, you know.”

<b>

That hit home.

<b>

I could only open and close my mouth, unable to refute her words.

<b>

I-I’m not even trying to be popular! Just because I was reborn as a handsome guy doesn’t mean I want to be pampered!

<b>

“...I’ll carry her, so at least guide me.”

<b>

Seeing that the three of them showed no signs of yielding, I reluctantly agreed. She had helped me with the bodyguard issue.

<b>

—I’m not trying to be popular, okay?!

<b>

Today, there was also the princess’s bombshell statement, so it was a day full of connections with women.

Regarding the princess, I don’t want to think about it too much right now. While I appreciate the sentiment, given who she is, thinking deeply about it would mentally drain me.

<b>

“What’s wrong? Didn’t you know Serah’s house? It’s so big.”

<b>

“I don’t know.”

<b>

“I thought you seemed close, so I figured you’d know.”

<b>

“Yes, yes.”

<b>

Apparently, from the perspective of the Thunderbolt party, we seemed close. I don’t recall being that friendly… It’s strange.

<b>

“Well, it can’t be helped… We’ll all take her home and hand her over to a butler or maid. But you’re the one carrying her.”

<b>

“Are you planning to work your master to the bone?”

<b>

“Aren’t we friends? Huh? Wasn’t that the case?”

<b>

Shin said with a grin.

Ah, that’s right! We are friends!

<b>

I couldn’t help but let out a deep sigh.

Then I looked at Serah, who was swaying next to me, and smiled wryly.

<b>

<b>

That night, it goes without saying that I was able to fall into a comfortable sleep.
