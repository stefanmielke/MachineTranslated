# 111 I'm Not a Hero.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The person I wished to meet countless times.

Finally being able to reunite with her should be the pinnacle of happiness, yet I’m suddenly being hugged, and she’s calling my name, which I thought she had forgotten. My brain is on the verge of short-circuiting. There’s no time to be moved.

<b>

I thought maybe Noah had talked to her beforehand, which is how she knew my name, but that doesn’t explain why she suddenly hugged me.

<b>

“W-wait… why?”

<b>

In other words, it’s incomprehensible.

<b>

I stood there, helpless and frozen.

From my ear, I could hear the sound of her sniffling and a voice that seemed to be sobbing.

<b>

“Hey, Noah! What the hell is going on here!? She should have forgotten about me, right!?”

<b>

I turned my head to the brat who probably knew what was going on.

<b>

Noah, whether he knew my head was in a panic or not, had a very calm expression. Do you want me to hit you?

<b>

“...Right now, I’m a living person, so I’ll explain properly, so please spare me the punch. But before that—“ ““Esar-san!!””

<b>

This time, I heard voices calling my name from the living room.

Next, the sound of footsteps running at full speed, completely disregarding the fact that we were indoors. The sound of the floorboards creaking violently was from two people.

<b>

“—Phenon!? Shiri!?”

<b>

They stopped dead in their tracks right behind Sera and directly in front of me, both of them with tears welling up in their eyes. No, tears were already spilling from the corners of their eyes.

<b>

For a moment, the two of them were silent, their faces contorted, but eventually, Shiri opened her mouth.

<b>

“...We’ve been waiting, waiting for you. We believed we would meet again someday.”

<b>

She was looking straight into my eyes, not even trying to hide her flowing tears.

I also wished we would meet again. It was because I wanted to see Shiri and the others again that I was able to endure my loneliness.

<b>

And then there was Phenon.

She was tightly gripping the hem of her loungewear, looking as if she was about to break down and cry out at any moment.

<b>

“Please, don’t go anywhere anymore…”

<b>

She spoke in a tone I had never heard before, as if she didn’t have the luxury to use polite language. It felt like a child was crying out to me. I’ve never experienced anything like that in this life or the last, so it’s just my wild guess.

<b>

Speaking of which, “don’t go anywhere” — that’s something I want to say. Even though I was used to being alone in my previous life, I couldn’t help but feel lonely because of Phenon and the others.

<b>

However, all three of them… without a doubt, they remember me.

<b>

“Noah, you’re not lying to me, are you?”

<b>

I narrowed my eyes and glared at the former administrator of this world. If this is a prank, it’s cruel beyond measure.

She shook her head vigorously and replied, “No, no!”

<b>

“I didn’t know until just before this happened either.”

<b>

“Huh? What do you mean by ‘this happened’—”

<b>

Please explain it in a way I can understand—just as I was about to say that, Sera finally released her body from mine. As the warmth I felt faded away, my head started to cool down a bit.

<b>

Sera was looking at me with her bright red eyes from a very close distance.

Could it be that she would explain it in Noah’s place? I thought so, but,

<b>

“—U-uh… Uwaaaahhh!”

<b>

She burst into tears.

<b>

The volume of her cries was far beyond the sobs from earlier, as she buried her face in my chest and just cried.

<b>

The two behind her were also in tears, drawn in by Sera. What am I supposed to do about this?

Noah, instead of acting like a grandma saying, “I’m glad for you,” hurry up and explain this situation!!

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

It took about ten minutes for the three of them to calm down.

The first to return to her usual self was Shiri, who guided me to the living room. The exterior was the same, and the layout was exactly as it was before.

<b>

“We all remembered and built the same house together.”

<b>

As I sat on the sofa in the living room and looked around, Shiri explained it to me like that.

<b>

“So, Shiri, Phenon, and Sera… you all have memories, right?”

<b>

“Yes,” “Of course,” “I remember.”

<b>

The three of them sitting across from me nodded in response.

<b>

I’m so happy, truly happy—!

If they had lost their memories, there was a possibility that we wouldn’t even be acquaintances, yet here they are, preserving their memories and calling my name again.

<b>

I want to cry and rejoice like them, but because there are parts I don’t understand, my emotions aren’t coming out properly.

<b>

“You thought Esar would lose our memories, didn’t you?”

<b>

“...Yeah, that’s right. I thought I would be forgotten by everyone in the world.”

<b>

I think I did well to hold on under those circumstances.

<b>

“We remember all the memories we had with Esar, and the memories from the broken world… We saw you defeat the God of Destruction, Venom, and save the world from another place. Normally, everyone living in this world should be grateful to you, but only seven of us have memories…”

<b>

Saying that, Sera bowed deeply. Following her, Phenon and Shiri also bowed their heads and expressed their gratitude to me.

I felt rewarded—my heart was filled with that feeling.

<b>

“The seven are the guild master of the royal capital, the Lightning Trail, Phenon, Shiri, and me.”

<b>

It seems that Regulus, Shin, Suzu, and Laika, who are not present here, also remember me. They are all people who were closely connected to me.

<b>

“Just before we disappeared, the Creator God of Earth—Ideya summoned us. Just like how Esar was summoned to this world.”

<b>

Following Sera, Phenon explained as well.

<b>

So, um… in other words,

they weren’t erased by Venom but were simply transferred to another place by the Noja Loli.

And when the new world was created, they returned to the original world—right?

<b>

“That’s right. They are residents of my world, so even if the world was recreated, they wouldn’t be forgotten.”

<b>

…My head is getting jumbled. There’s too much going on, and I can’t fully understand it.

Regardless of the mechanism, it seems there’s no doubt that only Sera and the other seven have memories of me.

<b>

“...By the way, Phenon, were you okay? You were sent back to when you were sick, right?”

<b>

I remember that Ideya said she would return the time to when I was summoned.

If my memory serves me right, it should have been about a year since then.

<b>

“That was not a problem. We returned to our previous age and bodies, but our levels were carried over.”

<b>

“...Oh.”

<b>

What’s that, it’s a cheat. Well, I can’t say anything about others either.

The Lightning Trail had cleared an A-rank dungeon, so of course, a B-rank dungeon would be a piece of cake.

<b>

“That’s why on the day the new world was created, I got the Elixir with the Lightning Trail and me.”

<b>

With a slightly regained composure, Sera said that.

Her eyes were still bright red, but her expression seemed to be regaining its energy.

<b>

“I’m glad to hear that…”

<b>

I let out a big sigh as I spoke. Then I leaned back against the sofa and looked up at the ceiling.

All my worries and anxieties were resolved, and everything was progressing in a good direction without me knowing.

<b>

Most of the inhabitants of this world seem to have forgotten about me, but the seven who are particularly close to me have retained their memories.

In a way, it feels like the ideal situation I wanted, where I wouldn’t stand out unnecessarily.

<b>

However, if there’s a problem…

<b>

“Will I, completely unknown, be able to get permission from His Majesty and Count Bernot…?”

<b>

I was recognized because I had the achievement of saving Phenon before.

While I was pondering with my chin resting on my hand, Phenon timidly spoke up. She was looking down, her cheeks flushed, glancing up at me.

<b>

“E-Esar-san? If I’m not mistaken, does that mean— is that what it is?”

<b>

—Geh, my inner thoughts completely slipped out.

I had properly prepared rings and everything, yet what is this roundabout and awkward confession?

<b>

“Uh… well, that’s what it means—“ “I’m so happy!”

<b>

In a flurry, Phenon rushed over to me. Then, as if jumping, she sat on my lap and wrapped her slender arms around my neck, hugging me tightly.

<b>

“P-Phenon! Esar is in trouble!”

<b>

It’s not that I’m in trouble because Phenon is light, but I’m confused. Even though we’re this close now, Phenon is still the first princess of the Lindell Kingdom.

Even if that weren’t the case, it’s impossible to avoid my body tensing up when a beautiful girl hugs me like this.

<b>

“It’s not fair that Sera gets to do it. I held back earlier, so it’s okay now.”

<b>

“—Ugh, that’s true… well, fine. Next is my turn.”

<b>

Why are you the one giving permission? It’s not “fine,” you idiot. What position do you think you’re in? And don’t treat me like an attraction.

<b>

While I was in a captured state by Phenon, I shot a glare at Sera. She whistled like a draft to escape my gaze and then clapped her hands as if she remembered something.

<b>

“Why don’t you become a hero again, Esar? If you do that, His Majesty and your father will recognize you.”

<b>

Sera said that and turned her expectant gaze toward Noah, who had been a bystander.

I wanted to object to her use of “again,” but I held back as the conversation seemed to be straying.

<b>

“That’s impossible. Because I’m not the administrator of this world anymore. Besides, he did defeat a demon lord-like existence and saved the world, but he’s not the heroic type.”

<b>

I think so myself, but hearing it from others feels like a hurtful phrase.

<b>

“In fairy tales, heroes finish their roles after saving the world, but he didn’t just end it by defeating the demon lord—because his essence is to reign at the top.”

<b>

Hehe, how about that? Isn’t that spot on?

Noah had a smile on his face as if he wanted to say that. Yes, yes, that’s right.

<b>

“I’m not a hero with a sparkling image, you know.”

<b>

As I sighed and said that, Phenon pulled away from me with her arms still around my neck. Naturally, we ended up staring at each other.

<b>

“No matter what anyone says, Esar-san is my hero!”

<b>

“Haha… well, thank you for that.”

<b>

I know that denying it would be meaningless to her, so I offered a temporary thank you.

But still, while saying that, I was clearly thinking of denying it in my mind.

<b>

I’m not a hero, you know—

<b>

<b>

Because that’s true, right?

<b>

<b>

After all, I’m now “the Overlord” Esar.
