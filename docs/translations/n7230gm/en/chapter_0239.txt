# A-122 Becoming an Enemy

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hey, hey, aren't you being a bit too cowardly? I can't believe you're the same person as the SR-kun from Tempest that I was watching."

<b>

"Shut up, you idiot!"

<b>

Using my status to my advantage, I forcefully blow Noah away with Byakuren. She caught my attack with her shield while flying backward, then spun in mid-air and landed with a calm expression.

<b>

I can't attack.

<b>

I know the reason—just as she said, it's because I'm scared.

Even though this dungeon is in a state that feels like a virtual world, the reality is too different from a game. It has too much reality to be recognized as a game.

<b>

"If this keeps up, I might really win, you know~. Give me a break, I want you to kill me, big brother."

<b>

"At least say something like 'lose' or something, that's too ominous."

<b>

It's been about three minutes since the battle with Noah started—neither of us has dealt any damage yet. I can clearly feel the annoyance of her mind-reading abilities.

<b>

Moreover, this is a fight where one of us could die in this dungeon—it's obvious which will move first, body or mind. Even in an extreme situation, it’s tough to be simultaneous...

<b>

But how should I attack—ugh. This thought is probably being read too. Seeing Noah's triumphant face makes it impossible not to understand. It's pointless to think.

<b>

What I can do is fight based solely on intuition from the experience I've built up until now. If I do that, I can almost nullify Noah's mind-reading abilities—so it seems. I can't say for sure how my thoughts are conveyed to Noah.

<b>

"Should I just say my thoughts out loud... Ugh, don't make this so troublesome, Noah. It's even harder because you look like a loli. Well, there are players who mess with their appearance like that, but what is that? A hobby?"

<b>

"You really say whatever you want, huh?"

<b>

"Because if I'm being read anyway, it doesn't matter what I think."

<b>

It's fine to be straightforward. I can avoid unnecessary thoughts. I can move with the premise that I'm being read.

<b>

"Actions based on the premise of being read—actions considering the opponent's mind-reading... Hmm."

<b>

"Well, that's a cool idea, but in the end, that thought is also being read by me, so it's meaningless."

<b>

Noah, saying this with a wry smile, suddenly widened her eyes and shrugged. Her gaze was not on me—but behind me.

<b>

"Looks like reinforcements have arrived."

<b>

Noah said that and gestured for me to turn around with her chin.

Then there, 

<b>

"Tempest Party Battle Ranking Number One, 'Moon' Crescent, has arrived!"

<b>

"Also from 'Moon', Hime-Suki has arrived—Hey Mika, why did I have to say Hime-Suki? I was finally getting known as Hisui."

<b>

The two strongest were having a carefree exchange that didn't match the atmosphere.

<b>

"By the way, what are you two doing? Out here in the middle of the night together."

<b>

"How did you guys find out... I thought we were in a lodge?"

<b>

"I saw SR-san running on the roof while talking to Hime-chan."

<b>

Why are you climbing up there? And at midnight.

It's not like I can say anything since I was running on the roof too. Please forgive me; I was trying to run without making any noise.

<b>

"It's a fight to the death. Either I kill my big brother, or he kills me. My big brother doesn't want to kill me, but I want him to kill me—so that's why we're fighting."

<b>

When Noah explained succinctly, Crescent put her hand on her chin and furrowed her brow. After thinking, she said, "This is getting weird!" with a clear expression of "Oh, this person doesn't really understand."

<b>

"I see, you both came to confirm the death in this dungeon, right? Then I'll—"

<b>

"Stop right there; that would just complicate things!"

<b>

I scolded Hisui, who raised her hand and indicated she wanted to do it. Since she usually doesn't shout, she shrank back. I'm not angry, so please don't be too down about it.

<b>

"You both can't do that. I have no intention of conceding this death. If you try to interfere with me, I won't hold back. I may no longer have the power of a god, but for you two, taking your consciousness would be child's play."

<b>

I'm saying this seriously, but in the end, this is just a test.

If someone gets a game over and reports, "It was like this," that's the end of the story. I wonder why it turned into such a serious atmosphere.

<b>

If I think that they care about me that much, I don't feel bad about it.

After hearing Noah's words, the two began to whisper and consult each other. Then, after nodding slightly to each other, they approached Noah, took weapons from their inventory, and faced me.

<b>

So then—are both of them trying to kill me? Are they prioritizing my feelings over Noah's? It's a complicated feeling, a mix of happiness and sadness.

<b>

"I'm sorry, big brother, but it seems like they're going to side with me."

<b>

"Seems that way."

<b>

I replied with a wry smile.

Noah's expression is ambiguous. She's smiling with a strained face. Of course, that's how it is; by siding with them, Noah's wish—to "let her be killed"—is moving away from her—wait, is that really the case? Will it be unfavorable with three against one?

<b>

"That's right, you're thinking correctly."

<b>

Noah nodded at my inner voice.

<b>

"It seems these girls have sided with me to make me lose."

<b>

Shrugging, Noah said this, and Hisui and Crescent next to her smiled.

<b>

"Because the reason SR-san hasn't won yet is that he's overthinking, right?"

<b>

"Leave it to us, Noah-san. We'll awaken Tempest's SR-san."
