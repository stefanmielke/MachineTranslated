# A-89 The Arrival of Lady Idea

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Perhaps it might be possible to call the princess Ski, who passed away on Earth, here.

That thought crossed my mind, but if such a thing were possible, I would want my parents to be brought back to life. If I had to choose which to prioritize, I feel bad for Crescent, but I would prioritize that.

<b>

It’s blasphemy against the dead—there might be some who would say that, but I am technically dead myself. Isn’t it fine to wish for it?

<b>

Since I had already made up my mind in my heart, when Crescent reincarnated here, that thought didn’t even cross my mind.

While we were discussing such things, Noah came down from the second floor and joined the conversation. By the way, it seems that Phanon and Sera are happily taking a bath together. Well, the bath is spacious after all.

I’ll avoid thinking about that as much as possible, since it would be bad if Noah read my mind while I was having inappropriate thoughts.

<b>

“What do you think? Why not ask Lady Idea?”

<b>

When I asked Noah, who was sitting next to Crescent, she replied in a light tone, munching on cookies that Shiri made, “Why not ask the teacher?”

<b>

“There’s no way I could have a casual conversation with a god like that… Besides, Lady Idea isn’t as fluffy as you, so it would be nerve-wracking.”

<b>

“Do I give off such a light impression!?”

<b>

“Maybe about as light as helium.”

<b>

“Are you saying I’m floating!?”

<b>

That’s exactly right. Sometimes he acts like a brat just as he looks, and then suddenly starts talking seriously; I wish he would match his appearance with his inner self.

However, even if Lady Idea were to grant permission, it would be troubling.

I do want to see them again, but do my parents even wish to be brought back to life? Imagining the two of them reincarnating, I feel like they would adapt quickly.

<b>

“Can’t do it for free, you know.”

<b>

Suddenly, a voice came from right beside me.

Turning my face to the right with enough force that I thought my neck might break, I saw Lady Idea, dressed in traditional clothing I had seen before, sitting calmly on the sofa. She jingled the ornaments in her hairpin and turned her face towards me.

<b>

“If we’re talking about possibility, there’s no problem. However, I cannot simply bring the dead back to life recklessly.”

<b>

“Well, that’s true.”

<b>

I felt a sense of resignation or perhaps acceptance. It was exactly the impression I had voiced. Noah seemed to feel similarly, nodding as if to say, “If Lady Idea says so, then it must be true.”

—But,

<b>

“Isn’t there any way to do it?”

<b>

Crescent seemed unable to give up on Princess Ski. She leaned slightly over the table, directing a fierce gaze at Lady Idea.

Knowing Lady Idea, she probably wouldn’t say something like “That’s disrespectful,” but I also didn’t have the impression that she would grant wishes unconditionally.

<b>

“Crescent aside, SR has been working hard. It wouldn’t be a problem to bring a few back—however, we must impose some kind of restriction—hmm, let’s do this.”

<b>

After saying that, Lady Idea clapped her hands together.

<b>

“As a reward for the first clear of an S-rank dungeon, I will call one person from Earth here. Since you’ve already cleared two, let’s start with this one.”

<b>

Even though we were in a state of not being able to keep up with the conversation, Lady Idea twirled her index finger. Just as the tip of her finger glimmered for a moment—

<b>

“Huh? —SR-san?”

<b>

On the table, Princess Ski appeared, dressed in a completely black ninja outfit.

Sitting in a girl’s pose, she stared at me with wide eyes.

<b>

“My cookies!?”

<b>

“Wait, that’s what you’re focusing on!? There are more important things to address!”

<b>

Isn’t this a bit too sudden? The development is happening too quickly for me to keep up.

Crescent is in an even worse state than I am; it was so abrupt that she rolled her eyes and leaned back against the sofa. That’s probably not a face she wants to be seen making as a girl, so I’ll try to avoid looking at her. It was shocking, so it might take time to forget.

<b>

“W-What on earth is going on? I-I shouldn’t have been able to log into Tempest…”

<b>

“More importantly, Princess Ski… that position on the table is not good.”

<b>

The ninja outfit she was wearing wasn’t the type with separate top and bottom pieces; it was just a top, and it looked like she was wearing something akin to leggings underneath.

Even though I knew it wasn’t underwear, it was so tightly fitted to her body that I found it very difficult to know where to look.

I regained my composure while silently confessing in my heart, glancing at Crescent, who was rolling her eyes.
