# 52 The Hero's Disciple

<b>

This is from Sera's perspective!

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"You have a good talent; you'll surpass me soon."

<b>

On the day my older brother, Ray, first trained me, he said this with a cheerful smile. It was when I turned 15.

<b>

As I trained under my brother, my swordsmanship improved rapidly, and eventually, I was able to achieve victory in mock battles against knights belonging to the kingdom's knight order.

Even though my opponent was a newcomer, they still had enough skill to be part of the knight order. My family, starting with Ray, was very pleased with my growth.

<b>

However, I have never been able to defeat my brother even once.

He became stronger faster than I could grow.

Perhaps it was after Ray obtained the title of the strongest in the knight order that I began to think of losing to him as something "inevitable."

<b>

The words he said, "You'll surpass me soon," would never come true—I thought so.

<b>

<b>

"Sera, are you really going to do this?"

<b>

On the stage surrounded by a large audience, Ray asked with a worried expression. It’s hard to imagine from his fierce face, but my brother has always had a very kind personality.

<b>

He probably thinks that he will win this match.

He’s likely worried that I, as a special guest, will embarrass myself, which is why he has that expression.

<b>

It's truly pathetic—but I recently suffered a defeat against Ray. It's understandable that he is concerned.

<b>

"I won't lose."

<b>

I could tell that my voice was different from usual. It was stiff and lacking confidence.

<b>

"You say that, but look at how many people are here. If by any chance Sera loses here—rumors will spread like wildfire."

<b>

"I know that!"

<b>

So Ray knew about it too. The baseless rumors that I only kept up with the Thunder's Trail thanks to my master.

No... perhaps it’s understandable for them to say that about me, at least.

<b>

In fact, if someone else had participated in the B-rank dungeon expedition instead of me, the outcome would have been the same. There are many explorers in this world who are stronger than I am.

Ray's participation might have made the exploration go more smoothly.

<b>

If my master fought alongside the Thunder's Trail, proving his strength would be easy.

Rather, he seems to want to hide his abilities, and he might not care much about the rumors. Besides, if there were any problems, my master would resolve them himself without me worrying. He has that much power.

<b>

"I will show you my victory..."

<b>

I whispered as if speaking to myself.

<b>

This is a match I cannot lose, absolutely cannot lose.

It's not to save someone, nor to protect someone's honor.

<b>

It's a battle to protect my own pride.

<b>

Before I knew it, I was gripping my sword so tightly that I could almost hear the bones creaking.

<b>

Ray, noticing the trembling tip of my sword, walked closer to me with a furrowed brow. Then he spoke in a voice low enough that only I could hear.

<b>

"Seriously... you're so tense. I'll maneuver well enough to make it look like a draw—"

"That's unnecessary!"

<b>

I inadvertently shouted, cutting off Ray's words.

<b>

"The match is about to start—Ray, please step back."

<b>

"But..."

<b>

Even after hearing my words, Ray only wore a difficult expression and did not move away. He must be worried about me, but that kindness feels painful right now.

<b>

The familiar guild master serving as the referee was looking at us with a troubled expression.

And soon, the audience began to murmur.

Voices of dissatisfaction rose against us for not starting the match.

<b>

It was at that moment.

<b>

"Trust me!"

<b>

A loud voice that seemed to crush the murmurs of the audience echoed through the arena.

That voice, which sounded almost like a shout, came from the direction of the VIP seats where the royal family and the Thunder's Trail were seated.

<b>

"Who do you think taught you?"

<b>

There was no mistaking it. I had been hearing it every day lately—my master's voice.

<b>

The audience fell silent all at once.

Both the guild master and Ray turned their gazes toward the source of the voice. The previously restless audience was now stunned by the sheer volume, losing their voices and looking toward him.

And of course, I turned my eyes to the seat where my master was sitting.

<b>

There he was, hiding his face with both hands and writhing in some amusing manner.

Sinn, sitting next to him, was laughing and patting his back. And Suzu and Laika were also laughing heartily. It felt like the atmosphere around that place was different from the rest.

<b>

"—Hehe."

<b>

I felt foolish for being so tense, watching his amusing antics. What on earth is that? Is he imitating a slime?

<b>

"What are you doing?"

<b>

Seriously... thanks to my master, I ended up laughing even though I was in front of my opponent.

<b>

"Is that person SR-dono?"

<b>

With a smirk on his face, Ray asked me.

I didn't understand why my brother had that expression, but the answer to his question was simple.

<b>

"Yes. He is my master, who has received the title of 'Hero' from the kingdom."

<b>

That's right.

He knows the secrets of this world like a god and possesses unparalleled strength; he is my master.

<b>

And I am— the disciple of the hero.

<b>

"My master is strong. He will be fighting against the Thunder's Trail in a party battle later, so Ray, you should learn from his exceptional combat skills."

<b>

"I'm looking forward to that—but before that, let's enjoy the match with Sera. You look like you're in good spirits. Is it thanks to his cheers?"

<b>

"Well, who knows? And—I'm not sure if Ray can enjoy this match with me."

<b>

Indeed, I have been losing to Ray.

But that was before I received training from my master.

<b>

I have become strong thanks to my master.

He told me, "If you can master it, it will be Sera's power," and "Have confidence, hold your head high!"

<b>

"I'm sorry, Ray, but I will win this match. No—"

<b>

I lowered my gaze to the ring on my left hand.

A simple ring with a vibrant green gem, given to me by my master.

<b>

Suppose this ring was not a party item but something given to me personally.

No matter how much money was offered or how luxurious the gems presented, I would never part with this ring. Even if this ring had no effect on enhancing my abilities, my feelings would not change.

<b>

This ring was given to me with my master's thoughts in mind.

Recalling the moment I received the ring warms my heart. My ears also feel hot.

<b>

To meet his expectations, a mere victory would not be enough.

Winning is a given—I must aim for something beyond victory.

<b>

"I will overwhelm you."

<b>

Just like my master proved his strength to the guild master of Raynas, I will overwhelm Ray and demonstrate my current abilities.

<b>

I may not fully believe in my own strength, but my master, whom I trust, believes in me.

Then, I can do it. I will definitely do it.

<b>

<b>

I am the disciple of the hero—SR.
