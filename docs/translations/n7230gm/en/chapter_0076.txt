# 73 A Certain Holiday with Sera

<b>

<b>

<b>

A certain holiday.

<b>

Today, Fenon and Shiri are absent, and it's just me and Sera enjoying our day off.

After indulging in an open-air bath since morning, Sera and I have arrived at our usual B-rank dungeon.

<b>

What? You think today isn't a day off?

That's right, it's a day off. I'm doing what I like because it's a day off.

<b>

"And so, Fenon and I took advantage of the guards' distraction to escape from the royal castle."

<b>

The sand hedgehog, cut from behind by Sera, lets out a pained cry.

<b>

"You two have been quite mischievous... I feel sorry for the guards."

<b>

"I'll have you know I tried to stop it, okay? I thought it would be better to avoid getting scolded. But when Fenon said, 'Oh? Are you planning to defy me?' there was nothing I could do."

<b>

"Hahaha, kids can't react quickly in those situations."

<b>

The magic projectile I launched hits the boss in the stomach.

<b>

"Indeed. In the end, we got caught at the castle gate and were lectured for a long time."

<b>

"I would have loved to see that scene."

<b>

"Please stop, it's embarrassing."

<b>

With a wry smile, Sera slashes the boss's side with her sword. Ah, it's dead.

<b>

As I watch the sand hedgehog dissolve into particles, I put my weapon away in my inventory. No rings dropped. Well, that's the usual.

<b>

<b>

When we exit the dungeon, the sun is beginning to set outside. We could go for a third round if we wanted, but it's a holiday today, and I can't push Sera too hard.

If I say I'm heading to the dungeon, she would definitely follow me.

<b>

The exploration for today is over—so I declared, and we headed home together.

<b>

"You've gotten quite strong over this past year, Sera. I think you could probably conquer a B-rank dungeon solo, right? It might be close, but..."

<b>

"Hahaha, I do want to challenge myself, but just in case something goes wrong, I think I'll wait until I have a bit more confidence."

<b>

Being cautious is a good thing.

Unlike in games, you can't come back to life in this world.

<b>

She glanced back at the B-rank dungeon behind us and then turned her gaze forward again. "Esar is amazing," she murmured.

<b>

"What do you mean?"

<b>

"…Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was just talking to myself. You know, conquering a B-rank dungeon a year ago would have made you a hero, right? Now it seems like the knight order and other explorers can conquer them too, and it's undoubtedly thanks to Esar that this trend has emerged. It's incredible how one person's strength can change the world this much."

<b>

"That's a bit of an exaggeration."

<b>

Even if I hadn't been summoned, someone might have noticed it eventually.

It might have taken some time due to guild regulations, but still.

<b>

"It's not an exaggeration. Thanks to you, hundreds of lives must have already been saved. It might have only been Fenon who was directly involved, though."

<b>

"Not everything is thanks to me."

<b>

I merely shared my knowledge, and the reason other explorers and the knight order can conquer B-rank dungeons is due to their own efforts.

From now on, the level of this world will continue to rise rapidly as if the shackles have been removed. Sooner or later, there will be people reaching level 100 in the third job class without me having to say anything.

<b>

"I hear that the Thunderbolt Trail is currently leveling up in the lower levels of an A-rank dungeon, and they should be able to conquer it soon."

<b>

"That's the number one party in the kingdom for you. …By the way, Esar can conquer an A-rank dungeon—right?"

<b>

"Yeah. I could go now if I wanted to, but I don't want to attract attention, so I'll wait for Thunderbolt Trail to conquer it. Since the public eye is finally shifting away from me, I don't want to do anything that would draw attention to myself."

<b>

"Hahaha... I must say, that's typical of you."

<b>

Sera laughed in disbelief and seemed to be trying to convince herself, saying, "Well, it's Esar after all."

<b>

When I spoke with Thunderbolt Trail through the communication magic tool the other day, they didn't seem particularly stuck and appeared to be progressing smoothly.

If they conquer the A-rank dungeon, an S-rank dungeon will appear, and the public's attention will shift to Thunderbolt Trail.

That way, I can avoid the pointless act of returning without defeating the boss in the A-rank dungeon and focus on leveling up in the S-rank dungeon.

To change to the third job class, I need to conquer at least 50 A-rank dungeons, though.

<b>

<b>

After chatting casually with Sera, we were greeted by soldiers who were looking around the house with "Welcome back!" before heading home. Truly, my house is comforting.

<b>

Sera and I both took off our outerwear and sat on the sofa, exhaling simultaneously.

<b>

And then, I voiced a thought that suddenly came to mind.

<b>

"By the way, I like dungeon exploration, so it's fine for me, but do you think other people want to conquer B-rank dungeons and above?"

<b>

In response to my question, Sera asked, "What do you mean?"

<b>

"Well, you see. The highest level potion, the elixir, can be obtained in a B-rank dungeon, right? Sure, A-rank and S-rank magic stones might be valuable, but most other drops are usually equipment or things that don't directly relate to life—just things to get stronger. If you can become rich just from the earnings of a B-rank dungeon, is there really any point for explorers to aim higher?"

<b>

In the game world, there were people who loved leveling up, enjoyed combat, and wanted to become strong to be admired by others. But here, it's mostly ordinary residents living their lives. It's undeniable that people like me, who think "Leveling up is the best! Dungeons are the best!" are in the minority.

<b>

"That's probably because Esar knows about the drops, right? For other explorers, they wouldn't know what drops might come, so they dive in search of treasure."

<b>

"And what about after I and Thunderbolt Trail conquer it and the drops are revealed?"

<b>

At my question, Sera put her hand on her chin and seemed to be thinking, "Hmm."

<b>

"…Even then, they would still dive into dungeons to get stronger. If those around them become stronger, they have to become even stronger to protect their loved ones. Especially for the knight order."

<b>

"Ah... I see."

<b>

I understand.

Unlike in games, there are likely wars and killings happening regularly. So, becoming strong is necessary for self-defense.

<b>

Sera placed her hands on her knees and slowly stood up from the sofa.

<b>

"Well, as long as Esar continues to get stronger, I will keep diving into dungeons. I want to stand beside you as a woman."

<b>

She probably went to prepare some drinks.

After saying that, she walked toward the kitchen.

<b>

As I watched her back, I tilted my head.

<b>

Hmm? Did she say "as a woman" instead of "as an explorer" for a reason?

I want to interpret it in a way that's convenient for me, but only she knows her true feelings, and I want to avoid getting my hopes up only to be disappointed.

<b>

...But just a little bit, I think I can be happy about it, right?

<b>

<b>

<b>

If they continue to follow me from now on, we will head together to A-rank dungeons—and then to S-rank dungeons.

<b>

Literally, risking our lives.

<b>

These girls will be entrusting their lives to someone like me, whom they've only known for a year.

<b>

I can't keep Fenon's reply on hold forever, and once Thunderbolt Trail conquers the A-rank dungeon, I plan to express my feelings to both of them.

<b>

If this were Japan, I would probably be called "insincere," and more importantly, it would be against the law. But in this world, polygamy is allowed.

The question is how the two will react to my words—but I'll just have to take a chance. If I'm rejected, then it will be what it will be.

<b>

I should consult with Shin about this at least once.
