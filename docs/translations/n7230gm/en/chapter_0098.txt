# 95 Noah, Again

<b>

<b>

<b>

"This is my last selfish request. Esuar."

<b>

Sera said this and leaned her face closer to me.

<b>

Even though my mind was fully engaged in wondering what kind of selfish request she was about to make, her sudden proximity caused my thought process to crash seriously.

<b>

Our noses touched, and I could see Sera's long eyelashes fluttering delicately just a few centimeters away from my eyelids. The particles of the defeated monster danced behind her, creating a fantastical atmosphere.

<b>

Then, I noticed something soft pressed against my lips.

<b>

"---Mmm!?"

<b>

This is a kiss—how long did it take for my confused mind to recognize that? It was too much for my limited capacity brain to handle.

I couldn't even tell if time was flowing; I couldn't be sure if it was seconds or minutes.

<b>

Before I knew it, her hand, which had wrapped around my waist, pulled me closer. However, I had no room to savor the sensation of Sera's body.

After all, I had no experience with kissing. The contact of our membranes was undoubtedly a more urgent situation than a hug.

<b>

Naturally, my awareness focused on my mouth.

A warm, pleasant sensation—someone else's heat was definitely stimulating my lips.

<b>

That heat faded away, as if melting snow.

<b>

"---We'll meet again."

<b>

And then she, too, dissolved into the air and disappeared.

With the best smile, tears streaming down her cheeks, she vanished.

<b>

Alone in the snowy field.

Like a withered tree, I stood still for a while.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

A few minutes after she disappeared from this world, I collapsed backward on the spot. I made full use of the snow cushion and spread out my limbs.

<b>

I didn't fall because I was shocked or fainted from anemia. My consciousness was unfortunately clear.

I was fully aware of the reality that Sera had vanished.

<b>

"I feel like my willpower has been completely drained..."

<b>

A sense of emptiness—would that be the right term?

Something important within me had been lost, and a strong feeling of loss overwhelmed me.

<b>

Feeling an itch on my cheek, I touched it and found it slightly wet.

<b>

"…Did I cry? I didn't even notice."

<b>

I lowered my eyelids and covered my vision with my right arm.

The image of Sera, who had just been in front of me, flickered vaguely in my mind.

<b>

"She was beautiful, Sera."

<b>

Thinking about what kind of face she would make when we met again made me feel gloomy. She would probably have completely forgotten about me and would surely treat me coldly.

<b>

"Ugh... ugh."

<b>

Sobs escaped me. But there was no need to worry about my surroundings anymore. There was no one in this world, so I could cry as much as I wanted without any problem. No matter how much I cried, no one would laugh at me.

<b>

I thought so, but—

<b>

"Existence cannot be—yet there are no traces—? Only those close to him? Is it his influence, no, he has no such power—something—of—"

<b>

Muttering, muttering, muttering.

<b>

I heard a familiar soprano voice from my left ear.

Just when I was indulging in sentimentality—damn brat.

<b>

But well... I had things I needed to do rather than mourn.

<b>

"…How long have you been there? And what are you muttering about?"

<b>

I wiped my tears with my sleeve and turned my face to the side. There stood Noah, whose half-body was still discolored as usual. Despite being a god of creation, she still looked like an elementary school student.

She put her hands together and closed one eye, saying, "Sorry, sorry."

<b>

"Don't worry about it; it's my story. I just got here a moment ago."

<b>

"That's a vague answer."

<b>

"Because it's true."

<b>

If you're going to claim to be a god, act more like one. "Because it's true" doesn't cut it.

Sighing, I sat up and crossed my legs. Then I shot a half-lidded glare at Noah.

<b>

"So, what should I do from here?"

<b>

"I'll explain in detail now. But before that—"

<b>

Noah said this and snapped her fingers without changing her expression.

In an instant, the scenery changed. At the same time, the softness of the snow disappeared, replaced by the sensation of hard ground.

<b>

"—If you're going to do this, at least warn me. It’s surprising."

<b>

A purple sky.

A gray earth.

That was the only scenery that continued endlessly.

<b>

"But since you cleared the S-rank dungeon, the seal on Venom has weakened, and honestly, it's quite tough just to maintain that world."

<b>

"That's not an excuse. If you've caused trouble for others, the first thing you should say is 'I'm sorry.'"

<b>

"I'm technically a god, you know... You don't really think I'm a child, do you?"

<b>

"It doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult."

<b>

"Before that, I'm a god..."

<b>

We went back and forth in an incredibly pointless exchange.

In the end, I managed to get her to say "I'm sorry," so I suppose that’s good enough.

<b>

"The conversation is going off track. So, what exactly is this place? Is it inside a dungeon?"

<b>

I looked around 360 degrees, but no matter which direction I looked, the scenery was the same.

It felt eerie that there were no stars in the sky, yet it remained bright. Just the purple sky was already unsettling.

<b>

"You were the one who derailed the conversation. Hah... this isn't inside a dungeon. Having a hole in a seal is pointless, and since you're the only one left in this world, there's no need for a dungeon. You don't need mountains, rivers, or anything else right now, do you?"

<b>

"…I’m not interested in what’s pointless and what’s necessary, but if there’s no dungeon, how am I supposed to level up?"

<b>

If I were told to train and defeat Venom, I would give up.

<b>

"That's not a problem. …How can I explain it clearly—Venom is still trying to grow, but I'm stopping that. The stagnant evil essence that I hold back is transformed into monsters, which you then defeat, converting it into magical essence. That magical essence serves as an energy source to make you stronger."

<b>

…Hmm.

I don't understand the mechanism, but it seems that I need this magical essence to level up.

<b>

"Can't you directly convert it into magical essence?"

<b>

"That's impossible. I can't convert it into magical essence, and I can't interfere with the transformed monsters either."

<b>

"There are all sorts of restrictions, huh?"

<b>

"That's how it is. I'm glad the conversation is straightforward."

<b>

Noah nodded with a relieved expression.

<b>

According to her words, it seems that monsters can be provided even without a dungeon.

Since the evil essence can only be converted from the excess that leaked from Venom, no matter how many monsters I defeat, I probably can't weaken Venom himself.

It would have been nice if I could fight a Venom weakened to slime level... but that might be a bit boring too.

<b>

Upon asking for more details, it seems that the magical essence obtained from defeating monsters can also be used to create equipment and potions.

It appears that all the drops from the dungeon were made from the evil essence that leaked from Venom. It's complicated to think that I'm getting stronger using the power of the enemy.

<b>

I received various explanations, but in the end, it seems that what I need to do hasn't changed.

<b>

Defeat monsters, level up, and challenge Venom.

Then restore the world to its rightful form and reunite with my companions. No matter how long it takes, or if I myself am not rewarded, I don't mind.

<b>

—Let the days of struggle begin.

<b>

"First, let's acquire all the player bonuses."

<b>

As I muttered this, my mouth unconsciously curled into a smile.
