# A-128 Tension Explosion

<b>

<b>

<b>

About an hour after entering the cave and encountering three goblins, confirming the strength of the monsters.

Although we didn't know the official names of the monsters, we continued our exploration while randomly naming them "Hyper Dango Bug" and "Mojamoja Giant."

<b>

From the moment we encountered the first goblin—no, even before that, once we entered this dungeon prepared by Lady Idea and started fighting monsters, it was clear that they were quite strong.

<b>

That said, the non-boss monsters weren't individually as strong as the bosses of an S-rank dungeon, nor did they have any outstanding traits compared to the rankers of Tempest.

<b>

Furthermore, thanks to Noah, it was revealed that death in this dungeon operates under the same rules as in the game.

So, what does that mean?

<b>

"Hyahaaahhh!"

<b>

"Bad guys, you ain't here!"

<b>

"It's tough to match that energy..."

<b>

Crescent and I were rampaging and racing through the dungeon. Taking advantage of having a guardian like Jade, we were running wild without a care. Our ability to sense presence had lost all meaning, and we simply charged ahead, slaughtering any enemies we found.

<b>

After all, it's been a while since I've felt the same sensation as in the game... and I get to play in a dungeon with someone who has experienced the same Tempest? It would be strange if I didn't get hyped up.

<b>

Probably, Crescent was just going along with my vibe.

<b>

Originally a solo player, I had never explored a dungeon like this in such a friendly manner. Since coming to this world, I had explored with Sera and the others, but I was always in a position to protect them. And I was exploring with the fear that I absolutely couldn't die, including myself.

<b>

While I superficially thought, "It should be fine," somewhere in my heart, I felt that "there mustn't be any accidents."

<b>

But now, that fear has been released.

<b>

Crescent and Jade are strong enough that I don't need to protect them. If left alone, they would win on their own. Together with such people, I can defeat monsters I've never seen before, and they are quite strong.

<b>

I'll say it again, it was strange that I wasn't hyped up until now.

<b>

"Ah, this is fun. Where's the boss?"

<b>

"We've been rampaging so much that it wouldn't be surprising if we killed the boss by passing through."

<b>

"Since no medals have dropped, we haven't encountered a boss-level monster yet."

<b>

After taking a breather, we had that conversation. By the way, my body is currently soaked. Why? Because I jumped into the river out of excitement. I just got wet. Instead of drying off with a towel, I'm moving around to dry myself off.

<b>

I'm in a state where water drips off me like a good-looking man.

<b>

"There's no struggle, but the enemies are at a good level. If I had let my guard down, I might have gotten hurt, and there are hardly any enemies I can take down in one hit."

<b>

"If we could earn money from this, that would be perfect. But I guess that's just wishful thinking."

<b>

"Since we're getting a house, it's like we're earning something, right?"

<b>

"Compared to the selling price of elixirs and potions, it's still a bit lacking."

<b>

That's true. Even though the supply of elixirs has significantly increased and prices have dropped, they still fetch a high price as drops from B-rank dungeons. There must still be a demand for them.

<b>

"That's certainly true. Well, if it's for leveling up like Sera and the others, then it should be fine, right?"

<b>

"Yeah. I've taken all the status bonuses, but there are first and second jobs where I've only taken the status bonuses and left them alone, so I need to max them out to get the skills. It’s probably more efficient than repeatedly going through S-rank dungeons."

<b>

Since the same monsters only exist on the same floor, and it's not efficient compared to the S-rank dungeons we've gone through multiple times, there would be no point in leveling up in this dungeon. Lady Idea has probably thought this through.

<b>

"If we stay too long, Sera and the others will worry, so we should find the boss soon, right? Honestly, I don't remember where this dungeon was located."

<b>

"Me neither."

<b>

"Me neither~"

<b>

Everyone was planning to return via emergency return, so it was all casual. Well, it's kind of like a game, so I think it's fine to be that relaxed.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After a leisurely conversation with Crescent and the others, just ten minutes after starting our exploration—we finally encountered a monster that seemed to be the boss.

<b>

"Okay, Jade loses! Please name it!"

<b>

It was a black monster that looked like a cross between a dragon and a turtle. While dodging the poisonous purple breath the enemy exhaled, we played rock-paper-scissors, and I asked Jade to name this monster.

<b>

"U-umm, how about Dragon Turtle?"

<b>

"That's too uninspired, Princess! There are other similar monsters! Capture more features!"

<b>

While attacking the monster that started spinning rapidly, Crescent said that. By the way, I was trying to attack the rocks on the ceiling to see if they would fall. They didn't budge at all.

<b>

"There's a 'Hyper Dango Bug' that Mika named in another dungeon! In the C-rank dungeon east of Palmour!"

<b>

"Chichichi, that's 'Super Dango Bug.'"

<b>

"They're the same!"

<b>

"No, they're not!"

<b>

What a futile argument. I mean, it's quite carefree to be facing a boss that surpasses an S-rank dungeon. I can't say anything about others, but if Sera saw this, she would probably scold us for our fighting style.

<b>

"Then, how about Ultra Black Dragon Turtle!"

<b>

"Let's go with that."

<b>

I immediately showed my agreement while attacking the enemy to prevent Jade from retracting her suggestion.

<b>

"Sounds good~ It feels like a hasty name that a kindergarten kid would come up with, which is the best!"

<b>

"I don't want to anymore..."

<b>

Named, Ultra Black Dragon Turtle. I can't criticize others, but Jade's naming sense is something else. I want to tell Sera and the others when I get back. I want to report it to the guild and make it the official name.
