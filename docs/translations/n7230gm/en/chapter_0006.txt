# 5 F-Rank Dungeon

<b>

<b>

<b>

Entering the dungeon, I frowned at the sunlight pouring down from the sky and took out a short sword from my inventory.

Inside the dungeon, the time outside seemed irrelevant, as the sun? shone brightly.

<b>

"Was this a grassland type?"

<b>

All F-rank dungeons in this world are about the same size as a soccer field. They come in various types such as grassland, seaside, cave, and ruins.

<b>

At a glance, it looks like a lush green field stretches to the horizon, but upon closer inspection, I could see a barrier shimmering like a soap bubble, reflecting rainbow colors. Neither the monsters nor I could exit beyond that barrier.

<b>

As I gazed at the scenery of the dungeon, a bouncy light blue object approached me, hopping along. A classic of the fantasy world—a slime.

It was about the size of a human head. Semi-transparent, changing shape with each bounce.

<b>

Speaking of which, players who were captivated by the exquisite cuteness of this strange creature had been trying to figure out how to get it out of the dungeon. In the end, it was impossible.

<b>

"—Hmph!"

<b>

With a shout, I kicked the slime like a soccer ball. I was among the players who didn't find this soft-bodied creature particularly cute. There was no mercy.

With a final scream of "Pigyah," the slime flew about ten meters. After bouncing a few times on the ground, it disintegrated into particles and vanished. I held the short sword in my hand, which had served no purpose.

<b>

"Now that I think about it... there's no need to use a weapon against a slime."

<b>

No, in fact, I could probably get by with just kicks for two or three floors. I believe the monsters were like rabbits and caterpillars. Both were about the size of small dogs, right?

<b>

I put the short sword back into my inventory and, while checking my body's sensations, I hunted down all the slimes that had appeared—rather, I kicked them all.

It seemed that one of my concerns, that "the monsters are significantly stronger than in the game," was unfounded.

<b>

I had defeated ten slimes.

<b>

If it were the same as the game, F-rank dungeons should have this number of monsters appearing up to the fifth floor.

And after defeating all the monsters in that floor, a window would appear.

<b>

"Alright, alright, just like the game."

<b>

After the last slime completely vanished, an F-rank magic stone, the reward, appeared. Then, I was presented with a window offering the choices of "Return" and "Proceed to the next floor."

<b>

"Let's wrap this up quickly. F-rank dungeons are like a tutorial."

<b>

Touching "Proceed to the next floor" on the window, light enveloped me. The transfer to the next floor began.

Now, let's continue to verify this game world that has become reality.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

Having exterminated the caterpillar that spits stones on the third floor, I was checking my status before heading to the next floor.

I had defeated a total of 30 monsters, and my level had risen by two to level 3.

<b>

"Hmm. It really doesn't show detailed stats."

<b>

I rested my chin on my hand, pondering.

For the people in this world, it must be quite confusing. If I ever have companions to explore with, I want to teach them in detail. I’ll give them a thorough education.

By the way, based on my knowledge, if I were to display the stats, it would look something like this.

Name: SR

Age: 18

Occupation: Swordsman

Level: 3

STR: F

VIT: F

AGI: G

INT: G

MND: G

Skills: ――

<b>

<b>

STR represents physical attack, VIT represents health and physical defense, AGI represents agility, DEX represents dexterity, INT represents magical attack and magical capacity, and MND represents magical defense.

<b>

Stats like STR are updated every ten levels, so currently, I am in the initial state with no increases. STR and VIT being F is because that is the original stat for a swordsman.

<b>

"There's no point in wishing for what I don't have. For now, I should tighten my focus from the next floor."

<b>

On the fourth floor, monsters the size of small dogs appear. They look like large lizards. The reason I need to tighten my focus is that they cast fire magic.

<b>

That said, the fireballs they spit out are about the size of tennis balls and not very fast. However, my MND is at the minimum value. Since they are just monsters from an F-rank dungeon, they probably won't deal fatal damage, but getting hit would definitely hurt.

<b>

"Surprisingly, that lizard might be just right for regaining my senses. The caterpillar's stones are too weak to provide any tension."

<b>

Even a child throwing stones would likely have more power. They pose no threat.

<b>

<b>

In VRMMO Tempest, my specialty was evasion.

Other top players who played Tempest also vouched that "only SR can do that," and surely it would become my weapon in this world as well.

<b>

On the game's discussion board, a player who witnessed my battles referred to it as "paper evasion" instead of "god evasion." I couldn't help but feel a bit mocked.

<b>

<b>

Fourth floor.

<b>

In a grassland where the expected monsters roamed, I finally took out the short sword from my inventory.

Since I wasn't here to play sports, it was time to engage in some real combat.

<b>

Noticing me, the lizard monster rushed over, flapping its limbs and opening its mouth wide.

<b>

"—Gah!!"

<b>

With its cry, a fireball flew toward my face.

Alright, alright, there are slight differences in appearance, but it's almost the same as the game.

Facing the approaching fire magic, I didn't crouch or dodge to the side; instead, I ran straight toward the fireball.

<b>

Three meters to the fireball—one meter—twenty centimeters.

<b>

Only then did I finally begin to evade. Even then, I just shifted my face slightly. That alone allowed the fireball to pass by me without touching me, the heat from it merely brushing against my cheek.

<b>

"—Hah!"

<b>

With the momentum of my charge, I swung the short sword down onto the lizard's head. With that one strike, the lizard perished—dissolving into particles of light.

<b>

"Hmm... something still feels off. It might be the significant drop from my original stats, but perhaps it's because it's my real body...?"

<b>

When the fireball and my face passed each other, there was a distance of five centimeters between them. It was disheartening enough to make me want to cry.

<b>

<b>

"If this continues, I might not even be able to conquer a B-rank dungeon, let alone a C-rank. I should eliminate any sources of anxiety."

<b>

Using my unique skill as a loner—"Soliloquy"—I began my special training on the fourth floor.

<b>

I practiced evading fireballs and slashing at imaginary enemies with the short sword—training that I continued without regard for time. The monsters in the dungeon don't run out of magical power like we humans do, making them perfect training partners.

<b>

In the end, I cleared the fourth and fifth floors, defeating the boss monster, a wolf, around 2 AM. Just like when I was gaming, when I'm having fun, I tend to lose track of time. The battle against the Overlord Venom is a prime example.

<b>

When I exited the dungeon, the private room set up at the entrance was empty. It seemed everyone had already gone home. I should head back quickly.

<b>

"I need to hurry to the inn and sleep. Tomorrow—or rather, today—I was told to come to the guild at 9."

<b>

I wished they had included an alarm function with the clock. Would Regulus-san be angry if I overslept?

<b>

"By the way, I wonder what happened with my story? I asked for a one-on-one duel, but..."

<b>

I thought a one-on-one would be the quickest way to convince them, but upon reflection, that would make me just a "newbie getting carried away." Especially Regulus-san might think a troublesome person has come.

<b>

For me, it would be great if they concluded that it would be better to crush their confidence once.

<b>

<b>

But the other side probably doesn't think for a second that their confidence will be shattered.
