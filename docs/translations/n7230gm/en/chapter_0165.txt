# A-49 Hieeeah

<b>

The first prince of the Palmoor Kingdom, Niz-kun, and I are set to meet in about two hours—after each of us has had lunch, we will gather at the northern gate of the royal capital.

<b>

The reason for this gap in time is not so much to take a long lunch break, but rather a result of considering the travel time through the city. If I calculate the time needed to take care of business at the guild, I would say I have about thirty minutes to spare for lunch.

I can’t just say to the prince of the kingdom, “Sorry, did you wait?” and expect him to reply, “No, I just got here,” so I can’t afford to be too leisurely. No matter how much I’ve accomplished in another world, I was born and raised in Japan, and it seems that the fundamental aspects of my nature don’t change so easily.

<b>

I remember the way thanks to my game knowledge, so I don’t need a guide, but I can’t explain that, so I head towards the guild in the prepared carriage. Well, there’s also the possibility that the game and this world are different, and the location might have changed recently, so it might be necessary to have someone guide me.

<b>

As I move, I look out the window of the luxurious carriage, observing the people and scenery of the city.

There isn’t a significant difference in the level of development between the countries, and the atmosphere isn’t much different from that of the Lindale Kingdom. This must be due to the close interactions between the nations.

<b>

<b>

“Um, I have the letter from Regulus and the letter from His Majesty Veed—alright, they’re here.”

<b>

Upon arriving in front of the guild and getting off the carriage, I check my belongings. I won’t make the mistake of standing in front of the reception and wondering, “Huh? Where did it go?”

<b>

“Wow… it’s quite clean here.”

<b>

As she observes the guild’s signboard and outer walls, Sera comments.

She is currently wearing the hair accessory magical tool she once had on, and her hair color has changed to dark brown. By the way, I have a small hairpin attached just above my ear, and my hair has turned silver.

<b>

“The size is probably a little smaller than that of the Lindale Kingdom.”

<b>

“Indeed.”

<b>

Fenon then shares her opinion, and Shiri agrees.

Like Sera, they are also disguised to avoid revealing their identities. Noah, who is not participating in the conversation and is subtly tugging at the hem of my clothes, has long hair today, giving her a different vibe than usual.

<b>

Even if people can’t tell who we are, if such beautiful women emerge from a beautiful carriage, the surrounding gazes will naturally gather. There are those who are captivated by the women and others who shoot me looks that could kill.

I can feel the murderous intent through my sensitivity to presence… I’m fine, but if anyone tries to hit on my wives, I’ll need them to quiet down—

<b>

“Now, now, calm down. There’s no way the method you’re thinking of is gentle.”

<b>

A little behind where Sera, Fenon, and Shiri are huddled together talking, Noah and I exchange hushed words.

<b>

“Hey, Noah, did you know? Elixirs can heal missing limbs.”

<b>

“I know that much! Just because Sera and the others are important doesn’t mean you should jump to conclusions!”

<b>

“Just kidding, just kidding. I’ll make cutting off limbs a last resort.”

<b>

“The fact that you’re even considering that is unsettling… And please don’t say where you’d cut off.”

<b>

Hmm… It seems she has read my mind again. She’s slightly lowering her gaze and blushing. Still, for a former god, her reactions are like those of a teenage girl.

<b>

<b>

As I pass through the door of the Explorer Guild, I receive curious glances as a newcomer.

The gazes don’t linger on any one member but seem to observe us evenly. Feeling like a customer-drawing panda, I head straight to the reception without wandering off.

<b>

“Hello. You may have already heard, but I am ASR from the Lindale Kingdom.”

<b>

Speaking quietly so as not to be overheard, I smoothly place two letters on the counter.

The receptionist, a woman who had a startled expression for a moment, then said—

<b>

“We have been informed. I will guide you to a private room, so please wait a moment there. However, the guild master, Wakka, is currently attending to another matter… You may have to wait about five minutes, is that alright?”

<b>

“Ah… um, that’s fine. I’m sorry for barging in without an appointment.”

<b>

“No, no. We appreciate you coming all this way.”

<b>

The possibility of saying “Sorry, did you wait?” to Niz-kun has slightly increased… but that’s probably within an acceptable range. Of course, I wouldn’t have the guts to make such a joke if I were late.

<b>

The receptionist, bowing respectfully, stepped out from behind the counter and began to walk ahead of us.

The explorers behind us, seeing us follow her, murmured things like “Do you know those guys?” and “Just one guy… lucky.” It seems that even with a simple disguise, the explorers in this country don’t know much about us. It wouldn’t be like this in Lindale.

<b>

As I idly ponder this, I follow the woman down the hallway, and just as we’re about to turn a corner, the receptionist suddenly comes to a stop.

<b>

“—Whoa!”

<b>

Perhaps due to my distracted thoughts, I stumbled when she stopped abruptly right in front of me. I almost ended up hugging the receptionist from behind, but I managed to hold back. If I had hugged her, I would have drawn the ire of a few people behind me… that was close.

<b>

“This is Neska-sama. Have you finished your conversation with the guild master?”

<b>

“Yes. It seems that tomorrow, I will be able to join those individuals… I-I must admit, I’m quite nervous about going into a dungeon with someone of such high status, but do you have any methods to calm my nerves, Mei-san…?”

<b>

It seems the receptionist’s name is Mei.

By the way, didn’t this person just call her Neska? It’s the same name as the person I’ll be accompanying tomorrow, but it can’t be a coincidence.

<b>

“Neska-sama is the representative of Palmoor, so I think you can stand a little taller without being nervous.”

<b>

“Is this how I should do it?”

<b>

As she says this, Neska places her hands on her hips and thrusts her chest out. Yeah, I don’t think that’s quite right.

For now, I’ll say she’s between Sera and Shiri. Not that I’ll specify what.

<b>

“In that sense… Ah, no, I think that’s fine… yeah. I think it’s good.”

<b>

With an air of having grown tired of explaining, Mei affirms Neska’s actions.

<b>

“Is that so! I feel like my heart has lightened a bit!—Ah, I’m sorry for stopping you. You were in the middle of work, weren’t you?”

<b>

As she says this, Neska shifts her body slightly to the side and looks at us standing behind Mei. She starts with me, glances at each of us, and then tilts her head in confusion.

<b>

“...Hmm? I don’t recognize your faces. Is this your first time in the royal capital—”

<b>

As she begins to say this, her gaze returns to me, her eyes widen, and her mouth freezes. Then,

<b>

“――――Hie――Hie, hie, hieeeah!”

<b>

Neska lets out a sound that resembles a scream.
