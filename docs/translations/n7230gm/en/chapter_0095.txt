# 92 The Taste of Tears

<b>

This is a story from Sera's perspective.

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Leave it to me."

<b>

With a smile that anyone could tell was forced, Esuar said.

Yet, even if he could only manage such a poor expression, I respect him.

<b>

If I were in his position, I wouldn't be able to lift the corners of my mouth at all.

I would likely curl up, shut myself in, and not be able to eat, wanting to talk to no one. There would be a good chance I might even consider ending my own life.

<b>

So, it's amazing that he can create a smile.

<b>

I want to be of help to him, even just a little—want to be a source of strength.

Even if I weren't in love with Esuar like I am, if someone spoke to me in such a trembling voice, on the verge of tears, I would want to lend a hand.

<b>

However, I cannot do that.

If I trust his words more than 'myself,' then no one in the world can help him.

<b>

I will soon disappear from this world, just like my friend whom I have no memory of.

<b>

"Hey, Esuar."

<b>

"Hm? What's up?"

<b>

He easily defeats monsters from an S-rank dungeon as if he were playing with a puppy.

I am also holding a sword, but I have no time to swing it, only on guard. Even if there were an opportunity, I am unsure if I could fight properly with my current feelings.

<b>

"Could you tell me about our meeting, about the days you've spent until now?"

<b>

"…I don't mind, but is it really fun to listen to?"

<b>

"It's not about whether it's fun or not; I want to know. The true past."

<b>

I do have some memories now.

However, there are many parts that feel clearly wrong or unclear. If I think too much, I might get confused and lose my mind, so I try not to think about it as much as possible, but it's evident that something is unnatural.

<b>

"I see," he said, nodding slightly while still facing away from me, and began to speak about the past in a gentle tone, as if reading a fairy tale.

<b>

From our meeting to the present.

<b>

What he spoke of matched my memories in some parts perfectly, while there were also parts that differed slightly, and some I had no knowledge of at all.

<b>

Whether we were resting after clearing the first floor, during the battle against the monsters on the second floor, or in the subsequent breaks, he continued to share a past I did not know.

<b>

He caught up to the present when we had finished defeating all the monsters on the third floor. It must have taken about five hours of talking.

<b>

"Thank you, Esuar."

<b>

"Don't mention it. I enjoyed reminiscing a bit too."

<b>

Indeed, he looked genuinely happy while talking about the past. Although, it was only recent history.

<b>

I—no, the wooden necklace I made with the First Princess is being held tightly against his chest. The gloves he wears were a gift from a maid named Siri, if I remember correctly.

<b>

<b>

The countdown timer continued, and even after finishing the story of the past, we kept talking.

Sitting cross-legged on a mat Esuar had pulled from his inventory, we faced each other.

<b>

"Hahaha! That makes it sound like I'm the fool here."

<b>

"No, it's not 'like' that…"

<b>

"Hm?"

<b>

I couldn't immediately grasp the meaning of Esuar's words and tilted my head.

Seeing my reaction, he began to rummage through his inventory in a fluster.

<b>

"—Oh, right! By the way, aren't you hungry? I have sandwiches."

<b>

"Oh, I hadn't thought about eating. Then I'll take you up on that offer."

<b>

"Sure thing."

<b>

Esuar said that and handed me a bottle of water and a sandwich. He then took out a similar item from his inventory and ate it.

<b>

"Is this going to be… the last time I eat with you?"

<b>

I hadn't intended to say it out loud, but I found myself murmuring those words.

<b>

"It won't be the last. Once I defeat Venom, we'll meet again. We'll restart from the beginning in a new world."

<b>

With his eyebrows furrowed, he smiled. Naturally, I ended up with a similar expression.

<b>

"Make sure to find me. If I lose my memory, it will be hard for me to find you."

<b>

"Of course. I'll find a way to rebuild relationships with everyone—Fenon, Siri, and the Thunder Trail. They're all important companions. And you, Sera, don't think I won't treat you just because you're a commoner."

<b>

"Hahaha! If I were to neglect you, then you can defeat me in a mock battle again. That way, I'm sure I could talk to you a lot once more."

<b>

"Are you going to start saying 'it's an attack by the jaw' again?"

<b>

With a grin, Esuar said.

Unfortunately, that memory still lingers in me. I wish that past would disappear along with everything else. "Please forget that," I said, bowing my head.

<b>

"I'm just joking. Well, if I raise my explorer rank, I should be able to contact Fenon, Siri, and others. If I end up saving Fenon's life again, we might be able to return to a similar relationship, but if not, it might be a bit difficult to get close again."

<b>

"That's not true!"

<b>

I unintentionally shouted with a voice that echoed all around.

Surprised by my sudden loud voice, Esuar looked at me with wide eyes.

<b>

"I think it's understandable for you to feel weak. Surely, only you can truly understand your heart right now."

<b>

While I want to understand Esuar's heart, it must be many times more painful than I can imagine.

Even if he becomes the savior of the world at the cost of his life, he will be forgotten by everyone and must live alone, carrying his sorrow.

<b>

"It must be painful and difficult. There’s nothing I can do for you now. But let me say this."

<b>

To him, who fears a future of loneliness, I want to say.

It may be an irresponsible statement, but I want to convey this feeling.

<b>

"Everything will be alright."

<b>

There’s no need to worry, I say.

Surely, even in the new world where we are reborn, as long as I can find you— 

<b>

"Losing my memory is sad, but you will remember me. So please, tell me about the past again, just like you did earlier."

<b>

No matter how many times this world repeats, no matter how many times I lose my memory, it will be alright.

Even if it is dozens, hundreds, or thousands of times—a staggering number.

<b>

"As long as I can talk to you, absolutely—"

<b>

I will fall in love with Esuar's character, Esuar's way of life, and Esuar's smiling face over and over again. In every future, without fail.

<b>

"I will fall in love with you, no matter how many times."

<b>

Finally, I was able to convey my feelings.

My first confession in life had a slightly salty taste of tears.
