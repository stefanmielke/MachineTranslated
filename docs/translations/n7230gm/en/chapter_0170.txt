# A-54 At the B-Rank Dungeon

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Since this is your first dungeon, make sure to stay alert. Well, it might be a waste of worry for you guys."

<b>

We completed the registration in front of the dungeon and were walking towards the transfer circle. During this, I called out to Noah and Sera, who were walking at the front.

<b>

"Noah seems to lack a sense of danger, and Sera looks like she might mess up at a crucial moment."

<b>

I nostalgically recalled the first B-rank dungeon I explored. Man, I was so flustered back then. It felt like being hit by a speeding car. Not that I've ever seen such a scene.

<b>

"You worry too much, big brother. It's fine here; we can have fun while we're at it, especially compared to A-rank or S-rank."

<b>

"Yeah. Since that incident, I haven't sustained any major injuries and I've been careful enough... So please don't bring it up too often. It's embarrassing now."

<b>

Noah responded with a smile, while Sera had a slightly sulky expression.

Of course, I'm worried, but given their current status, even if they took a decent hit, it wouldn't lead to a fatal injury right away. That's why I have no objections to letting the two of them head into an unexperienced dungeon together.

<b>

"It seems like no one is worried about us. I guess it's because we have someone with the title of Overlord here, right?"

<b>

"Haha, well, I have confidence that I won't lose to anyone."

<b>

"As expected of you."

<b>

It seems that Niz-kun's escort is waiting outside and is already not present here. It's just the five of us from ASR, along with Niz-kun and a serious-looking royal guard.

<b>

The royal guard speaks little and only utters words if we engage them first. They give off a very professional vibe.

<b>

<b>

After seeing off Sera and Noah, who headed into the dungeon first, we also stepped onto the transfer magic circle. I set my license card into the stone pillar, and the transfer began.

<b>

Niz-kun looked a bit nervous.

Next to him, the royal guard was tensing up. Perhaps they were imagining a scenario where they would risk their life to protect the prince, like saying, "Leave it to me! Please step back, Your Highness!"

<b>

Well, it's unlikely that such a situation would arise.

<b>

<b>

The B-rank dungeon closest to the capital of Palmour is a wasteland stage. Like grassland-type and desert-type dungeons, it has the characteristic of being easy to spot enemies due to good visibility, but also easy for enemies to spot you.

<b>

In other words, if you approach with barely adequate stats, the likelihood of being surrounded in a prolonged battle is troublesome, but if you challenge it with high stats, it becomes a good hunting ground.

<b>

"I was too focused on Esuar-kun, but... isn't the Lindale Kingdom too special? The princess and the maid... aren't they too strong?"

<b>

"They're a bit special. I've been training them for quite a while, and our country has been quick to spread knowledge about professions."

<b>

Regarding training, it mainly involved leveling up. Of course, I taught them some combat knowledge, but I'm not very good at teaching... Only Sera seems to fully understand.

<b>

"I wonder if that explains it... Well, if they received direct training from the Overlord, I guess that makes sense?"

<b>

"I haven't always been the Overlord, though—hey!"

<b>

In the middle of our conversation, I dashed forward and struck down an enemy. The tiger-like monster's head flew off and vanished into particles.

<b>

"Well done, Esuar-san!"

<b>

"Haha, thanks, Fenon. Your timing and aim with magic were perfect too. Shiri's shooting was flawless."

<b>

"Thank you very much!"

<b>

The two who were a bit away from where Niz-kun and I were standing expressed their gratitude with big smiles.

They found a new enemy and started walking towards it. The rest of us men followed after them.

<b>

"We're still on the second layer, but you're not nervous anymore, right? We've leveled up quite a bit, so as you can see, we're relaxed. There's almost no chance of Niz-kun and the others getting into danger... but, you know..."

<b>

"Uh? I mean, I'm not nervous, but... what do you mean?"

<b>

Niz-kun raised a questioning brow at my hesitating words.

<b>

"Well, your dad told you something like 'go see the threats to our country,' right? After watching our battles, do you understand the strength—or rather, the fear—of the enemies?"

<b>

"...Now that you mention it, it feels like it's actually fading away."

<b>

"Right?"

<b>

Our strength should be at a level that can't be explained just by having high levels.

It might be hard to understand since the damage amounts aren't clearly displayed as numbers, but I would be troubled if Niz-kun misunderstood that "with high levels, dungeons can be cleared so easily."

<b>

Since nothing has been announced to the public yet, I can't carelessly talk about status bonuses... but it's been quite a while since the secondary derived jobs were announced, and I think there are people who have noticed, even if it hasn't been widely publicized. Especially among active explorers.

<b>

Maybe it's time to officially announce the status bonuses in Lindale Kingdom regarding the "Lightning's Path."

And for now, in this country—

<b>

"Niz-kun, after we finish this dungeon, I'll show you my list of professions. After that, just wait for the announcement from Lindale Kingdom."

<b>

"?? I don't quite understand, but is that related to the threats of the dungeon? Or is it related to that skill of yours that no one has seen?"

<b>

The skill Niz-kun is referring to is probably the one I showcased during the battle with the "Moon" party in Lindale's arena.

For now, I decided to dodge the question with a casual "Who knows?"

<b>

"At the very least, it should prevent any misunderstandings about the difficulty of B-rank dungeons. I think."

<b>

"Haha, that's a rather irresponsible statement. Well, as you said, I'll wait for the announcement. No one in this world seems capable of prying it out of you."

<b>

Saying that, Niz-kun laughed in exasperation. From that smile, he didn't give off the aura of an unapproachable royal, but rather seemed like he was smiling at a close friend.
