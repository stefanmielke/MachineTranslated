# A-9 The Correct Answer is Thirteen People

<b>

<b>

If a complete stranger were to see this tragic scene, would there be anyone who could immediately answer who the criminal is?

If there were someone who could answer with certainty, they would likely just be blinded by the beauty of the girls.

The words reaching my ears while I waited in the entrance hall were so horrific that I couldn't help but think that way.

<b>

From all over the building,

<b>

"I am innocent! This guy stole the apple――Ubuoo"

<b>

"I needed the medicine to help my sick sister――Gebooh"

<b>

"My pregnant wife――Ahfun"

<b>

I heard such deep, painful cries, and then, gradually, the number of voices decreased, ending with groans.

In their place, the cute voices of the women became clearer.

<b>

"I did it! That's five!"

<b>

"Ugh, well done, Phenon. I'm still at three..."

<b>

"...There are still chances. If I snipe from a distance with a bow――"

<b>

The men tried to weave explanations, but not a single hunter was willing to listen.

Even someone who didn't know the situation would realize that it was the men who were doing something wrong if they thought carefully about what they were saying.

However, one side was desperately trying to communicate, while the other side was happily defeating their opponents without even trying to listen.

<b>

Thanks to Noah, it has been revealed that "everyone is a criminal," and it seems like they are managing their strength well, so there doesn't seem to be a need for scolding... but it's a bit scary.

<b>

"I might not have a turn after all..."

<b>

I was trying to stay alert, but it seemed that there was no worry about the girls being in danger.

If the people from the royal castle found out that Phenon and the others were doing something so dangerous, they might get angry, but as long as I made up some excuse about "accidentally getting caught up in an incident," it should be fine.

<b>

As I was thinking about such things, I heard a voice from the entrance of the inn saying, "I wonder about that."

When I turned around, there was Noah, arms crossed and eyebrows furrowed.

<b>

"Phenon and the others' skills are already well-known among most of the citizens, starting with the King of Lindale. I don't think you need to worry that much."

<b>

"You were bored too, huh?"

<b>

"You're with your brother, right?"

<b>

"Well, yeah... But still, Phenon and the others have gotten really strong. It's not just their levels; they seem to have gotten used to the situation."

<b>

It seems that during the year I was away, they had not only leveled up in the dungeon but also gained a lot of practical training. In fact, in this peaceful country, they might have been accumulating stress from not having opportunities to showcase their abilities.

<b>

"It must be your brother's influence. After all, your husband is a combat maniac who loves dungeons."

<b>

"St-stop calling him husband, it's embarrassing!"

<b>

"Hahaha, you're blushing! Your face is all red, big brother."

<b>

"Y-you little brat!"

<b>

I grabbed Noah's head, who was laughing and pointing at me. She was saying "It hurts, it hurts," but her expression was one of joy. Should I squeeze a little harder? Oh?

<b>

As we exchanged complaints and engaged in a friendly sibling quarrel, the door at the entrance of the inn slowly creaked open.

<b>

"Um, you are the ASR members I met earlier, right? What is this commotion about? And those people over there who are collapsed with their eyes rolled back...?"

<b>

The knights who had just handed over the man in the white shirt appeared, making a clattering sound. There were two of them.

After they stared wide-eyed at the men tied up with ropes, they flinched at the sounds of screams coming from above and below, as well as the cheerful voice of Siri saying, "That's eight now!"

<b>

"Uh, um, what is the situation here?"

<b>

"Ahaha..."

<b>

While pondering what to answer, Noah and I exchanged forced smiles while still in our embrace.

<b>

<b>

After that, Noah and I provided a false explanation that we "happened to discover" the situation, and one of the knights went to call for backup.

<b>

"...Do you need reinforcements?"

<b>

The knight asked cautiously, as if trying to gauge our reaction.

<b>

It was clear that we didn't need any.

<b>

Even now, the entrance hall was filled with cheerful voices like "That's fifteen now!" "Sixteen! No, was it seventeen? It might be eighteen!" "Sera-san has thirteen people!" Instead, if anyone approached them now, even if it was a knight, they might become prey.

<b>

"I don't think it's necessary. As you know, they are strong. It would be helpful if your companions could come and take these guys away."

<b>

"Of course... By the way, the man you handed over earlier was muttering something strange during the interrogation."

<b>

"Something strange?"

<b>

Could it be that he liked the way he was tied up and wanted to share it...?

<b>

"Yes. He kept saying things like 'I was attacked invisibly' and 'What I'm thinking is being exposed'—it sounded delusional."

<b>

Not at all. It was a very serious matter.

<b>

The knight didn't seem to be suspicious of us; it appeared he was just making small talk to pass the time.

<b>

"That's quite a terrible delusion. He might need to atone for his sins while also receiving some mental healing."

<b>

Sorry about that, man in the white shirt.

<b>

"Right? The invisible attack must be from Sera-san's phantom sword or something..."

<b>

"That's right. By the way, did he say anything else?"

<b>

Before I could respond, Noah jumped into the conversation.

She seemed curious about what the thief had told the knights.

<b>

We had been talking without any pretense in front of that thief... Of course, I hadn't mentioned anything about player bonuses or that I had been reincarnated.

<b>

"...Well, there is something, but... it's quite rude to ASR-san and the others."

<b>

Oh.

<b>

I wondered if it was something insulting towards me or the women, but it seemed to be a bit different.

Noah seemed to have already understood through her mind-reading ability, and there was no need to hear it directly from the knights here, but she conveyed to me through eye contact, "Why not ask?"

<b>

Feeling a bad premonition, I decided to ask the knights about the content.

<b>

"Well, he kept rambling, 'Men are wearing a mask! That guy is the culprit who did that incomprehensible attack!' and even started asking for his release in exchange for information."

<b>

That's really troublesome, the knight said, shrugging his shoulders.

<b>

Well, words from a criminal aren't worth trusting.

<b>

No matter how much that guy made a fuss, it wouldn't lead to an investigation into me. I hadn't done anything wrong.

The members of ASR, starting with Noah, understood that, which is why they had been able to speak freely.

<b>

When I officially marry Phenon and the others, the knights will probably realize that the thief's words were true. But for now, I want to live freely for a while longer.

<b>

"Haha, I'm not that great of a person. I'm just a handyman."

<b>

In response to my words, the knight laughed and said jokingly, "But you are receiving guidance from the members of Thunderbolt's Trail, aren't you?"

<b>

For now, that's fine.

<b>

But eventually, when the time comes to have my abilities recognized by those around me, it would be better to solo clear an S-rank dungeon and defeat Thunderbolt's Trail on the public stage.

<b>

Of course, when that time comes, I won't fight with handicaps like before; I'll go all out—with the Emperor class.
