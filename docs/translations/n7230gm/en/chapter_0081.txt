# 78 Yukarimusubi

<b>

<b>

<b>

The surprise party that was planned without my knowledge can be said to have successfully astonished its target.

The target in question was genuinely surprised――or so they say.

<b>

A feeling of happiness at being celebrated.

A feeling of embarrassment at unexpectedly becoming the main character.

A feeling of guilt for taking everyone’s time.

<b>

Various emotions surged, but nothing surpassed the joy. It was an event unimaginable during my time on Earth.

<b>

The lively conversations of the Thunderbolt's crew and my party members.

<b>

Of course, I, the main character, am also partaking in the conversation, but just watching everyone laugh and enjoy their meal brings me joy. The dishes prepared by Shiri were all luxurious and rare foods, unlike anything I usually see, contributing to the extraordinary atmosphere.

<b>

“――Mmm!”

<b>

Shin, with a piece of chicken in his mouth, claps his hands. It seems he remembered something.

Despite the presence of title holders, a countess, and even royalty, the dining scene is utterly lacking in manners, but I really like this atmosphere where everyone has let their guard down.

He mumbles something while moving some dishes on the table to create space.

<b>

“Shin, that’s really bad manners.”

<b>

“Exactly. We have Lady Phenon here, after all…”

<b>

The women of Thunderbolt’s crew admonish him. Shin, looking a bit embarrassed, chews and swallows the meat, places the bone on the plate, and mutters, “Sorry.”

Ha, you’re getting scolded.

As I watch the downcast Shin with a grin, Phenon, who is elegantly enjoying her meal, calls out to him.

<b>

“You don’t have to worry about manners. There are only explorers here… Besides, SR doesn’t like stiff meals, right?”

<b>

“Hmm, well, that’s true. It’s a hassle.”

<b>

“Right!”

<b>

Phenon beams with a bright smile.

She must be happy to have guessed my opinion, but I can’t believe she can make such a face over something so trivial.

<b>

More importantly, this steak is delicious. What kind of meat is this?

As I close my eyes and focus on the taste on my tongue, I feel a tap on my shoulder.

<b>

“Sorry to interrupt your bliss, SR. This is a gift from us.”

<b>

Perhaps because he was scolded by the women, Shin speaks with a slightly clouded expression. He pulls out potions from his inventory and starts lining them up on the table.

Clink, clink, clink――he carefully arranges each bottle of potion.

<b>

Ten――twenty――thirty――.

<b>

That’s a lot!! How many does he plan to bring out!?

<b>

“Uh, we have ten elixirs and fifty superior potions. The more gift-like items are probably prepared by the other members, so we brought practical items. I thought you might be running low on elixirs since you haven’t been diving into the B-rank dungeons in the royal capital. The superior potions are just a bonus.”

<b>

“That’s a lot… but it’s helpful.”

<b>

As Shin said, elixirs can only be obtained in the dungeons of the royal capital, so for me, based in Renus, it’s quite a hassle to go get them.

I’m not engaging in any dangerous fights that require using elixirs, but having a stockpile is always better.

<b>

“Is it really okay to receive this much?”

<b>

I direct my gaze to the female members other than Shin to ask.

Suzu and Laika both nod.

<b>

“I’m currently diving into A-rank dungeons, but for a while, I was just defeating that cyclops. I also sell elixirs to His Majesty, and to be honest, I have plenty. If you want some, I can sell them anytime.”

<b>

“Haha, that’s helpful.”

<b>

Since they probably aren’t fighting in a way that consumes elixirs either, they likely have no opportunity to use them. Elixirs are useful as insurance, but they are just that—insurance. They are rarely used.

<b>

That said, as someone responsible for the lives of my party members, I want to have as many of those items as possible.

I will never let them die. At least, not while I’m alive.

It’s best to meet death from a happy old age, not from injury or illness.

<b>

As I chew on my salad and reaffirm my resolve, Shiri comes over to me.

<b>

“Next up is my turn.”

<b>

Saying that, she pulls out from her inventory――gloves? No, that’s not it.

<b>

“These are gloves preferred by swordsmen. They’re made of a thin, strong material, so I don’t think they’ll get in the way.”

<b>

Black fingerless gloves wrapped with a light blue ribbon.

There weren’t any such equipment in the game, and my palms didn’t get calloused like they do now. When my calluses burst, I would apply potions to seal the wounds, but the hardened skin wouldn’t return to normal.

For someone like me, these gloves are a very welcome item.

<b>

“Can I try them on?”

<b>

“Of course!”

<b>

After receiving her permission, I carefully untie the ribbon and put the gloves on both hands.

<b>

Oh… these look cool.

My long-suppressed inner middle schooler is being stimulated.

<b>

They fit snugly against my skin, and just as Shiri said, they don’t get in the way at all. I take out my sword from my inventory and grip it, but the feel is no different from usual, so it seems it won’t affect combat. Even if it did, I would still use them.

<b>

“I know you’re happy, but don’t swing around sharp objects here, okay?”

<b>

“I-I know.”

<b>

That was close. I almost thought about practicing my swings.

As I hurriedly put the sword and gloves back into my inventory and thanked Shiri, she smiled and replied, “Yes.”

I almost found myself falling for her, but I remind myself that such reckless romance would be bad, and I manage to avoid that. It was truly close.

<b>

“Lastly, it’s from me and Phenon. We made it together, so don’t lose it.”

<b>

Trying to hide her embarrassment, Sera speaks quickly and bluntly. It’s clear she’s blushing from her red ears, but… let’s pretend I didn’t notice.

<b>

On the hand that Sera extends toward me is a wooden disc about five centimeters in diameter――and a leather cord connected to it.

The disc has a flower pattern carved into it, but it’s not a high-quality piece made by a craftsman; it has a handmade warmth to it.

<b>

I cautiously pick up the wooden object as if I were handling glasswork.

Considering its construction, it seems to be an amulet to hang around the neck?

<b>

“Did you and Phenon carve this?”

<b>

“Yes! I carved this part! The slightly rough part over here is Sera’s work.”

<b>

“N-No, SR! That part was just a slip of the hand――. Th-This part! The bent petal was Phenon’s doing.”

<b>

“It can’t be helped if I sneezed!”

<b>

They start bickering playfully.

That said, it doesn’t feel like they’re really fighting; their exchange seems fun, so it looks fine to leave them be.

I’m not sure if they can hear me, but I go ahead and say “thank you” to both of them.

<b>

“That’s a flower called Yukarimusubi. Its roots crawl underground and can extend for dozens of meters, connecting with other Yukarimusubi. So that flower symbolizes that even if we are far apart, our hearts are connected.”

<b>

Suzu says while peering at my hand.

It seems she noticed that I didn’t know what kind of flower it was. It’s a name of a flower I’ve never heard of on Earth.

As I gaze at the flower while listening to Suzu’s explanation, Phenon leans in closer.

<b>

“Of course! I have no intention of leaving you!”

<b>

“The roots of Yukarimusubi are sturdy. It also has the meaning of ‘never letting go.’”

<b>

Following Phenon, Sera proudly puffs out her chest as she says this.

<b>

Sera… I hate to burst your bubble while you’re showing off your knowledge, but you’re giving me a flower that has the meaning of “never letting go,” you know? You should be a bit embarrassed.

<b>

As I think this, Laika points it out to Sera with a grin. She freezes like a toy with dead batteries.

<b>

After moving her mouth in a fluster, Sera’s face quickly turns as red as a ripe tomato. Then she dashes off to the restroom.

<b>

<b>

I’m not the only one who laughed at Sera’s retreating figure, am I?
