# 104 Shirokō

<b>

<b>

<b>

The short sword I used, named Shōren. In the game Tempest, it belonged to the category of "Demon Blade."

<b>

The reason I used Shōren was not because it was the strongest weapon. Weapons come in various types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, so some users might find Shōren to be "difficult to use due to its short reach."

<b>

As for the shortcomings of Shōren, first and foremost is its reach, which is shorter compared to regular swords or katanas.

Additionally, the sword itself has low durability, so if it takes a strong impact to the side, it can lead to disastrous consequences.

In the game, it could be repaired by taking it to a blacksmith, but becoming unusable during combat was one of its fatal flaws.

<b>

Regarding the two points above, they can still be managed.

If a player is skilled in handling swords or katanas, they can effectively evade enemy attacks, and the short reach might not bother them at all.

<b>

The biggest flaw, and also the greatest strength—that is the fact that it is a "Demon Blade."

<b>

"Noah, is this pace okay for you?"

<b>

I called out to the creator god, who was likely listening somewhere during the battle.

Then, without any delay, a response came directly to my head.

<b>

"I'm fine. Every time you attack Venom, I'm converting the evil energy into magical energy, so you'll actually be recovering your health and magic to the point of having a surplus. But be careful."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

I replied shortly and once again slid the blade of Shōren against Venom's leg, which I had already struck countless times. I dodged the enemy's tentacles and magic with a backstep while firing magic, then closed in again to slash the same part.

<b>

"The regeneration speed hasn't changed—huh. It seems I can take him down faster than when I defeated Venom in Tempest."

<b>

As usual, I was enjoying the battle with Venom while muttering to myself.

However, just because I was enjoying it didn't mean I was slacking off. The timing of my blinks had to be consciously adjusted, making it a very intense fight. That's why it was fun.

<b>

Tentacles approaching like they were stabbing—tentacles attacking like whips. I dodged them, sometimes slashing, and at other times, I diverted their trajectory with gravity magic.

<b>

As for the attacks from Venom, if one is not surrounded by enemies like I am now, a skilled player could evade them.

Even if they weren't players, I'm sure someone like Sera or Shin could handle a leg or two of Venom without any issues.

<b>

Among the players in Tempest, there were some who could endure solo. Still, there were only a handful of them.

<b>

So why was it said that defeating Venom alone was "impossible"?

It was simply because Venom possessed an incredible regeneration ability.

<b>

As for how fast that regeneration was, it was such that even the total assault from the top party in this world, known as the Thunderbolt's Trajectory, would be outpaced by Venom's regeneration ability.

In other words, no matter how many hours, days, or years they continued to attack, they wouldn't be able to defeat Venom, let alone leave a mark.

<b>

One must continuously deal damage that exceeds Venom's regeneration speed while responding to all attacks from its legs—this is why it was said that defeating Venom alone was impossible.

<b>

Well, it seems I managed to do it.

<b>

"Shōren really is amazing."

<b>

I muttered while taking in the white light glowing from Venom's wounds.

This weapon, which some people might detest, is my best partner, especially in battles against Venom.

<b>

The ability that I believe makes Shōren the strongest is called "Shirokō." True to its name, which means "white brilliance," the parts cut by Shōren glow with a white light.

Of course, it doesn't just end with "Wow, that's beautiful"; it has a proper meaning.

<b>

The glowing part lasts for only three seconds.

During those three seconds, the amount of magical damage that part receives is tripled.

<b>

This ability cannot stack if you attack continuously within the three seconds; it will overwrite the previous effect, but even with that drawback, the benefits are more than enough.

<b>

To gain that benefit, one needs the Demon King's skill—the effect of the one who governs magic. This skill increases the effects of all magical skills by 20% and halves the amount of magic used, making it an excellent match for Shōren.

<b>

While the effect of Shōren is not a skill, so it doesn't get the 20% boost, this short sword consumes magic power with each slash, thus halving the amount of magic used.

<b>

And as can be inferred from the fact that it consumes magic, attacks with Shōren are classified as "magical damage."

<b>

The one who governs magic—body enhancement—Shōren—and the Demon King, a high INT class that engages in ultra-close combat while being a magic class—this is my perfected combat style.

<b>

To realize this, one must properly acquire player bonuses from classes other than magic, possess the skill to accurately target the parts marked by Shōren, and have extremely high reflexes.

<b>

It seems that several players who tried to mimic my style faced Venom with exactly the same equipment, but according to rumors, they didn't last a minute. My condolences.

<b>

"Hey Noah, so far it doesn't seem much different from Tempest—if anything, it feels weaker."

<b>

It might just be a slight difference in sensation between virtual and real. Venom's movements feel slower than they did in the game.

<b>

"The Venom in the Tempest game moved just a bit faster than in reality, so your feeling is correct. But don't let your guard down. It's entirely possible that it will use magic you've never seen before."

<b>

"That sounds troublesome..."

<b>

"Be careful."

<b>

"Yeah, yeah."

<b>

I must defeat this creature safely—and surely.

I need to take it down without falling into a critical situation, just like I did when I defeated Venom in Tempest.

<b>

Even so.

Even knowing that the fate of the world is at stake, I can't help but hope, deep down, that Venom is evolving.

<b>

"Is it because I'm a battle maniac, like they said?"

<b>

I laughed derisively and slashed with Shōren. Perhaps the accumulated damage had reached its limit, as Venom's leg crumbled like dirt.

<b>

About an hour has passed since the battle began—huh. The pace is not much different from the game.

<b>

Just because one leg is down doesn't mean the enemy's attacks will lessen. On the contrary, the attacks from the enemy increase.

<b>

"Stay focused."

<b>

Defeat is not an option.

For the sake of saving the world, to meet Sera and the others again—and for my own pride.
