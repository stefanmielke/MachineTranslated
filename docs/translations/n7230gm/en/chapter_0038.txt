# 36 Future Appearance

<b>

<b>

<b>

Amidst the commotion, Mr. Regulus appeared, walking over with heavy footsteps, grabbing the collar of the man who had been bothering me, and began to extract information while he was suspended in mid-air.

<b>

In the meantime, the explorers who had been jeering from around began to quietly slip away from the scene.

<b>

What remained were me, Sera, and Mr. Regulus, along with the now teary-eyed man hanging in the air. Additionally, the townspeople who were not explorers were watching us from a distance, curious about what was happening.

<b>

After hearing most of the situation, Mr. Regulus, looking irritated, tossed the man onto the roadside and apologized to me and Sera before leading us to the guild.

<b>

The nameless explorer fled the scene in a hurry, as if escaping from a hungry beast. He must have been quite scared of Mr. Regulus. The townspeople laughed as they watched the fleeing explorer.

<b>

Since it was the first time I had seen Mr. Regulus so angry, I didn't have the luxury to laugh at the explorer. I could only stare blankly at the unfolding events.

<b>

Then, while being the center of attention, we entered the guild through the back entrance instead of the crowded front entrance.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

We arrived at the usual private room. It had been this soundproof private room since we talked before conquering the B-rank dungeon and during meetings.

<b>

"I'm sorry. We make sure to properly educate the explorers who use our guild to avoid such incidents."

<b>

Sera and I sat side by side, while Mr. Regulus sat on the opposite sofa.

On the table were the usual unchanging tea snacks and tea, along with coffee.

When I protested to Mr. Regulus that "I prefer coffee," my request was easily granted. I should have said it sooner.

<b>

"I didn't recognize those faces much, but did those people come from another town?"

<b>

"Probably. The royal capital has a concentration of dungeons, and it's the most suitable place for leveling up new professions."

<b>

Indeed, Mr. Regulus was right.

After all, from F-rank dungeons to B-rank dungeons, they are within walking distance.

If I had reincarnated in a town other than the royal capital, I would have moved to the royal capital first.

<b>

"I understand that, but... why were they flocking to the guild? Shouldn't they be heading to an inn or a dungeon?"

<b>

When I asked this, Mr. Regulus gave me a sidelong glance.

<b>

"Are you the one to say that, Esuar? We decided together to issue permits at the guild, didn't we?"

<b>

The "permit" Mr. Regulus was referring to is something necessary for lower-ranked professions to delve into dungeons other than F-rank, separate from the explorer license.

I thought it would be better to issue the permits in advance rather than confirm them at the reception in front of the dungeons...

<b>

"Yes, but that can be issued at any guild in any town, right?"

<b>

"Well, yes. If you look at the explorer license, the exploration history is clear at a glance, and you can see the level by looking at the status. Issuing the permit itself should be easy."

<b>

"Then why the guild in the royal capital?"

<b>

I don't understand.

<b>

If they want to delve into the dungeons of the royal capital, they could issue the permit in their own town before coming. It’s obvious that trying to issue it in the crowded royal capital would lead to congestion.

<b>

Mr. Regulus let out a big sigh in response to my question.

Then, in a serious tone, he said.

<b>

"...The guilds in other towns are much smaller than this one. They were probably as crowded as this guild yesterday. So rather than waiting to issue permits, they likely thought it would be better to go to the royal capital first and secure an inn."

<b>

"...What a nuisance."

<b>

Sera, who had been silently listening to our conversation, furrowed her brow at Mr. Regulus's words.

<b>

In our case, we only need to show a sealed letter without needing a permit, so it's easy for us, but perhaps because we were subjected to verbal abuse, I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about the act itself. Sera probably felt the same way.

<b>

"I'm sorry too, Sera. Even though the identity of explorers doesn't matter, that was a bit excessive."

<b>

At Mr. Regulus's words, Sera shook her head.

<b>

"The guild master doesn't need to apologize for that. Besides, when I decided to act as an explorer, I was prepared to accept this much."

<b>

Oh... Sera, that's kind of cool.

Mr. Regulus also murmured, seemingly impressed, "I see."

<b>

After taking a sip of tea, he continued the conversation.

<b>

"I have a quick way to silence those guys."

<b>

With a sudden change from his earlier troubled expression, Mr. Regulus said with a cheerful face. I had a feeling that this might lead to something troublesome.

<b>

While I was grimacing, Sera asked without hesitation, "What is that?"

<b>

"In a month from now, a martial arts tournament will be held in this royal capital to showcase new professions. However, only the knights who have already started transitioning to new professions will participate."

<b>

Oh... so they are going to hold such an event.

<b>

Even in games, PvP events were held from time to time, but I never thought it would happen in reality now.

However, I couldn't see the connection in the conversation.

<b>

"If it's only the knights, then doesn't that have nothing to do with us?"

<b>

After all, we are explorers, not knights.

<b>

In response to my question, Mr. Regulus prefaced his response with, "If you two were ordinary explorers," and then began to explain.

<b>

"The 'Lightning Trail,' which was announced as the discoverer of the derived advanced profession, will be fighting against the winners of the martial arts tournament's party battles. As for the individual battles, that hasn't been decided yet, but... how about it? Would either of you like to fight against the winners? There will be plenty of spectators, so it's the perfect opportunity to showcase your skills."

<b>

I see.

<b>

So, we who have conquered the B-rank dungeon will participate in the martial arts tournament as special guests.

If we can defeat the strong warriors who have risen through the ranks of the knights, those foolish explorers will have no choice but to fall silent. I'm fine with it, but I want Sera to apologize on her knees.

<b>

However, it was mentioned that it would be one of us, and I would prefer to decline.

<b>

I wouldn't mind a mock battle with Sera at the guild, but doing it in front of a large audience like an event could lead to troublesome situations later.

<b>

That said, it would probably be more certain for me to participate in order to win, but I wonder how Sera feels about it? If she absolutely doesn't want to participate, I wouldn't mind fighting while downplaying my abilities.

<b>

As I thought about this and turned my gaze to Sera, she happened to be looking this way as well. Our eyes met.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Esuar, but could you let me participate?"

<b>

With a serious look in her eyes, she said that.

<b>

Coming from Sera, I honestly expected her to say something like, “Esuar has the skill, so she should be the one to enter.” …Seems like I still don’t fully understand her after all.

<b>

"Of course, I don't mind. Do you like events like this?"

<b>

"I'm not particularly fond of them, but..."

<b>

Sera said that and then lowered her gaze.

She seemed like she wanted to say something, but the words didn't come out easily.

<b>

I wondered if I should say something to her—just as I was thinking this,

<b>

"Is it okay if Sera participates? If so, we can proceed with the arrangements on our end."

<b>

Mr. Regulus entered the conversation at just the right moment.

Despite his physique and facial features, he is someone who can read the room.

<b>

"Yes, please do."

<b>

"Alright, understood. ...Esuar, just take it easy."

<b>

For some reason, Mr. Regulus looked at me, who wasn't planning to participate, and said with a wry smile.

Really... what an insightful guild master.

<b>

<b>

When I was playing Tempest, top players competed with all stat bonuses obtained, showcasing their skills.

From my perspective, the inhabitants of this world haven't even reached the starting line yet. After all, the foundation hasn't been established.

<b>

The inhabitants of this world will eventually reach the third job and will come to realize the existence of stat bonuses without being taught. By that time, they will finally understand how powerless they truly were.

<b>

That future appearance will likely be embodied by Sera at the martial arts tournament in a month.
