# A-111 Planning

<b>

<b>

<b>

If that's decided, it's time to take action.

<b>

Although my parents' revival gives off a sense of being an afterthought, it's true that both are important to me.

<b>

However, while I can simply move forward with excitement regarding the new dungeon, meeting my parents makes me a bit nervous, or something like that...

In any case, it's a complex feeling.

<b>

A change of subject.

<b>

Currently, the S-rank dungeons in the three countries of Lindale, Palmour, and Rezel have been cleared.

If we clear the S-rank dungeons in the remaining three countries of Feima, Insen, and Niket, we will have successfully conquered all dungeons.

<b>

This time, unlike Tempest, the Demon King Castle won't appear; instead, Lady Idea will prepare something new for us.

<b>

"Do Crescent and Jade have any preferences on where to go?"

<b>

"Hmm... I think I'd prefer Niket among these. It's close to Lindale."

<b>

"I'd go with Insen. It’ll be good practice for multiple versus one."

<b>

"I see."

<b>

In that case... since the S-rank dungeons in Insen and Niket are close, would it be better for the two of them to clear each country together rather than separately?

<b>

Even though the S-rank dungeons may be easy for them, it's still true that they are adjacent to death.

<b>

When I tried to convey this without hurting their pride, I was told I was "overly worried" and "like a guardian." What's wrong with that?

<b>

"Hehe, but I don't want to worry Esuar, so we'll go together. That's okay with you, right, Mika?"

<b>

"I guess it can't be helped. If I worry too much and Esuar can't move, that would be sad, so we'll do that."

<b>

Jade smiled gently, and Crescent laughed teasingly.

If just being laughed at can help me avoid one source of stress, that's a bargain. With two of them, the chances of something going wrong are unlikely.

<b>

After all, they were at the top of Tempest.

<b>

Since I decided to leave Niket and Insen to Crescent and Jade, our ASR headed towards the remaining Feima Kingdom.

<b>

I let Crescent and the others choose first because I planned to clear the rest when I had time anyway—besides, I have no particular strengths or weaknesses, and everything seems similar.

<b>

Still, each country has its own characteristics.

<b>

Niket is known for its agriculture and vast lands, while Insen is known for its fishing and has more dungeons than other countries.

<b>

And in Feima, where I'm headed, gambling is popular.

<b>

There were things like predicting the outcomes between players, and there were places like casinos. However, the knowledge I have is based solely on games, so I don't know how similar the real thing is.

<b>

Niket, Insen, and Feima might not even resemble the countries I know.

<b>

So, I asked Sera about it—apparently, while gambling is popular, the betting format I'm familiar with doesn't exist.

<b>

Instead, there are competitions of skill.

<b>

"Wow... I wonder what that's like."

<b>

Leaning back against the living room sofa, I ponder.

<b>

What kind of streets are there? What kind of explorers are there? How is it different from Tempest?

<b>

"I hear there's something like archery target practice. There seem to be various other things, but if it's Esuar, you'll definitely win."

<b>

Sera spoke proudly as if it were about herself. It's a bit embarrassing.

<b>

"No, I think I'll pass. If Sera and the others participate, I'll cheer them on."

<b>

The difference in our stats is too great, and it feels like cheating. If such things exist, I'll leave it to my party members.

<b>

Well, I don't even know if they will participate, and I don't know if it's held regularly or if it's always going on.

<b>

I'm sure if I really wanted to know, I could get information from somewhere, but I decided not to pry too much. I thought it could wait until we got there.

<b>

"Well, I don't plan to stay long this time, so let's clear it quickly and head back. To see the new dungeon and meet my parents."

<b>

It’s easier to be reincarnated at home than to be called while traveling.

If I told them this is my current home, my dad and mom would be surprised.

<b>

As for the fact that I'm married to a princess and a countess, they might faint.

<b>

...But I have a feeling they might accept it surprisingly easily. They are my parents, after all.
