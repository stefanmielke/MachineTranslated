# 0 The Overlord Venom

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

I watched as that massive body transformed into fine particles and disappeared, feeling as if it were someone else's affair.

<b>

"........Finally over."

<b>

The boss of the SS rank dungeon.

In other words, I successfully soloed the final boss of this game, the Overlord Venom.

<b>

It felt both short and long—no, it was definitely long. I was exhausted.

<b>

The VRMMO "Tempest."

<b>

This battle was one that over a million players had given up on due to its extreme difficulty.

<b>

After more than ten hours of combat, I finally accomplished what was said to be "impossible for any human."

Now I could become the legendary fourth job, "Overlord."

<b>

Don't underestimate the power of a NEET.

<b>

I didn't let out a triumphant shout, nor did I tremble with joy. All that escaped me was a deep, deep sigh.

<b>

The inside of the Overlord's castle, the final stage, was filled with silence.

<b>

<b>

My parents died in a car accident. The shock made it difficult for me to perform at work, leading to my resignation.

<b>

It was not a pleasant way to end my job.

I was yelled at by my boss and received nagging comments from colleagues about "increasing work" and "being weak-hearted."

Would anyone normally say such heartless words to someone who lost their parents? It's unimaginable.

I think of them as demons or monsters disguised in human skin.

<b>

Having quit my job, I was too afraid of hearing such things again to consider changing careers.

<b>

Fortunately, I had the money my parents left behind and my own savings.

While depleting those savings, I spent my days immersed in games, continuing to turn my back on reality. Before I knew it, I was 33 years old.

<b>

"I really liked this game..."

<b>

I had defeated the final boss.

<b>

A sense of loss washed over me, like finishing the last bite of my favorite food.

<b>

It was then.

<b>

"Why is a window appearing?"

<b>

After the Overlord Venom vanished without a trace, that pale blue screen appeared.

<b>

A window with choices only appears when clearing a floor in the dungeon.

Each time a floor is cleared, you can choose to return to the dungeon or proceed to the next floor.

<b>

In other words, after defeating the final boss, there should be no options since there is nowhere to go. The norm is to return, but...

<b>

"Reincarnation... what does that mean?"

<b>

The window that appeared before me displayed the choices of "Return" and "Reincarnation." In the upper right corner of the options was a countdown timer.

<b>

9 minutes and 24 seconds remaining.

<b>

"Is it something like a strong and new game?"

<b>

Curiosity began to stir within me at the unusual window.

However, I felt that if I chose reincarnation, all the various job levels I had raised would be wiped out. In fact, it was definitely going to be that way. Reincarnation in games usually works like that.

<b>

"Hmm..."

<b>

I pondered, pondered, and pondered.

<b>

Before I knew it, the countdown timer had dropped below three minutes.

<b>

"After all, as a gamer, I can't not choose 'Reincarnation.'"

<b>

Resolutely, I touched the reincarnation window.

<b>

Then, the pale blue window instantly turned bright red, and a warning-like message appeared. A crackling sound like electricity echoed.

<b>

<b>

That 1—All job levels will be reset.

<b>

That 2—All items in possession will be lost.

<b>

That 3—Avatar and character name will be carried over.

<b>

That 4—You cannot return to the original world.

<b>

<b>

After those statements, the choices of "Return" and "Reincarnation" appeared once more.

<b>

I understood points 1 to 3.

Point 2 was quite regrettable for me, but if I accepted such harsh conditions, I could expect some rewards in return.

However, what about point 4? What does that mean?

<b>

"Returning to the original world...? Does that mean I can't cancel?"

<b>

There should be a better way to phrase that...

<b>

Hmm, I don't get it.

<b>

"Anyway, I never intended to cancel, so it's fine."

<b>

I touched the "Reincarnation" window anyway. Then—

<b>

"Wha-what's happening!?"

<b>

The moment I touched the window, a red-black current-like substance wrapped around my arm. Elbow, shoulder, neck—like a snake tightening around its prey, that current enveloped my body.

<b>

"What an amazing effect... it's incredibly real—"

<b>

—I wanted to continue, but suddenly my body became paralyzed and I couldn't move. I couldn't utter the words I wanted to say.

<b>

Is it lag? Should I log out for a moment—

<b>

Just as I began to think that, a particularly loud "crack!" echoed. With that piercing sound, my consciousness fell into darkness.

<b>

<b>

<b>

☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆

<b>

<b>

<b>

It's unusually bright.

<b>

As I opened my eyes slightly, I was met with sparkling light. I couldn't help but furrow my brow.

<b>

It's too bright. Wait, why am I sleeping?

...Huh? What was I doing in the first place?

<b>

I remember something strange happened after defeating the Overlord Venom—oh, right. Reincarnation, I chose the reincarnation option.

<b>

I tightly closed my eyes and stretched my back. A yawn escaped me.

<b>

<b>

"The hero has appeared!!"

<b>

<b>

"—Shut up."

<b>

I couldn't help but mutter that and put my hand to my ear.

Huh? What did they just say? Who? What’s going on?

<b>

Rubbing my eyes, I managed to lift my eyelids.

<b>

The first thing that came into view was a luxurious chandelier radiating bright light. Next were the elaborately decorated walls and the blue sky visible through the window.

<b>

Huh? Where am I, really?

<b>

As I sluggishly sat up, I realized I was in the royal castle of the greatest nation in the VRMMO Tempest—the Lindell Kingdom, surrounded by the king, queen, prime minister, and royal guards. They all seemed to be rejoicing.

<b>

"......The royal castle?"

<b>

Did I start in the royal castle after choosing reincarnation? What is this situation when I just woke up—huh?

<b>

"......I thought I just woke up—?"

<b>

Impossible. That is absolutely impossible.

<b>

If you lose consciousness while playing a dive-type VR game, the forced logout function should activate. Of course, it's impossible to sleep in the game.

<b>

What on earth is going on?

<b>

"Are you feeling unwell, Hero?"

<b>

Turning my gaze toward the voice, I saw the prime minister of the Lindell Kingdom. His name is Dino, if I recall correctly. I've never been spoken to by him since I started the game.

<b>

Ignoring his words, I concentrated and tried to summon the menu window in my mind. The logout option was nowhere to be found.

<b>

Various pieces of information raced through my head.

<b>

Losing consciousness in the game.

The strangely realistic atmosphere of the prime minister speaking to me.

The menu window without a logout button.

<b>

I spread both my palms wide and stared at them intently.

Veins, wrinkles, sensations—all too real—no, it was reality itself.

<b>

"Could it be—I've 'reincarnated' into the game world...?"

<b>

I uttered such an absurd notion.

I held my head and muttered "impossible, impossible" repeatedly. Someone was shaking my shoulder and calling out to me, but it didn't register at all.

<b>

And finally, overwhelmed by confusion, I vomited right there.
