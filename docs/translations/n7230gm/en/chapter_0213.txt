# A-96 Kingdom of Rezel

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After arriving in the capital of the Kingdom of Rezel, we all went to the royal castle to meet His Majesty the King.

There was no request made of us, nor any restrictions placed; we were simply told to enjoy this country freely.

<b>

However, if we were to delve into an S-rank dungeon, it would be helpful if we could receive that information―― it felt like the king was maintaining his dignity while also adopting a somewhat humble demeanor.

I felt that this was not directed specifically at Lindell, but rather an evaluation of our abilities. In any case, it was more appreciated than being treated with high-handedness.

<b>

Then, guided by the second princess Katariya, we were shown to our accommodations. Although it was called an inn, it was actually a guest room within the royal castle, and we, the party from the Kingdom of Lindell, were treated entirely as honored guests.

It would be one thing if it were just me and Crescent, but with Fenon around, it couldn’t be helped. Well, the atmosphere is relatively relaxed, so it shouldn’t be too suffocating.

<b>

After memorizing our place of residence, we promptly set out into the city.

<b>

Fenon and Sera seemed to be talking with the second princess Katariya, and of course, Shiri joined them.

I don’t know what will happen starting tomorrow, but Fenon mentioned it had been a long time since they last met. There must be a lot to catch up on. I wonder if Sera was making sure not to leave Fenon out?

<b>

Conversely, I came to the town to ensure that Crescent and Jade wouldn’t feel awkward, but there isn’t much difference from the Kingdom of Lindell.

There are slight differences in the number of people and fashion issues, but it’s not enough to be bothersome.

<b>

"Shall we head to the guild for now? Or do you want to explore the town?"

<b>

The four of us—me, Noah, Crescent, and Jade—arrived at a bustling area. We traveled by carriage to the noble district, but from there, we walked. We also declined any guards.

<b>

"I'll follow Esuar's decision."

<b>

Jade said this as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

She could express her opinions freely instead of being so obedient.

<b>

"I want to go to that ice cream shop!"

<b>

You’re free in your own way. Well, that makes it easier for me.

<b>

"Big brother, I want to eat ice cream too."

<b>

"Don’t suddenly act like a little sister out of nowhere."

<b>

Crescent aside, Noah looks like a fifth grader, and Jade is around 150 centimeters tall, so she’s on the smaller side for her age. I feel like I’m babysitting.

<b>

We entered the shop, bought soft serve ice cream, and sat down on the terrace to take a break.

The shop itself had a café-like design and sold quite a variety of drinks.

While there were no electronic devices, there were various magical tools similar to them. This area seems to be the same for any country. Once there are windows displayed in mid-air, I think it’s pointless to worry about the details.

<b>

"Even if we clear the S-rank dungeon, just going there and back would be too bland. Noah might not like it, but I’d like to at least greet the Vinzett siblings."

<b>

To be honest, if we rushed to finish everything, our interaction with the Vinzett siblings and the exploration of the S-rank dungeon would be done in a day.

<b>

It would be fine to do a light round for weapons and armor, but the rare drop here is the white lotus I already have. Jade, who shares the same combat style as me, already possesses it, so there’s no profit in it.

Well, I think it wouldn’t hurt to have it for someone else to use.

<b>

"Arnold… I’m not good with that."

<b>

Noah, holding the soft serve ice cream in one hand, rested his chin on the table and complained. Don’t refer to nobles from other countries as "that."

Even if they are gods, it seems that dealing with a lolicon inflicts some mental damage.

When I explained the situation to Crescent and Jade, they both let out dry laughs.

<b>

"But Esuar is kind of the same, right?"

<b>

"Hey, don’t say things that sound bad! I’m normal!"

<b>

I do acknowledge Noah to some extent, but this guy has a much higher mental age than us. It’s like a legal lolicon situation.

<b>

"But, Esuar, you’re originally in your thirties, right? Isn’t it true that there are many people around you who are much younger?"

<b>

"I think liking younger people is different from being a lolicon, Mika."

<b>

Jade sighed and offered a lifeline. Thank you.

<b>

"Huh? Ah, that’s true. So, does that mean Esuar likes younger people?"

<b>

For some reason, the conversation took a strange turn. Why is it about my age preference?

But now that I think about it, I guess I do like younger people―― I haven’t really thought deeply about it.

<b>

"That’s terrible! Big brother is excluding me!"

<b>

"You’re my little sister, so you’re below me."

<b>

"That’s just a setting."

<b>

"You shouldn’t say that yourself…"

<b>

It’s good that there are no other customers around, but this isn’t a conversation for outside.
