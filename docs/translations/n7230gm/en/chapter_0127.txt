# A-13 Confession

<b>

<b>

<b>

We didn't want to imitate Arnold and aim for the ground headfirst, so we quietly used the stairs to exit normally.

<b>

I have no intention of making the same mistake as him, but there are red-haired women who tend to mess up during important moments, and I also don't want to make too much of a fuss.

<b>

We hurried through the unusually deserted guild and arrived at the scene of the commotion, where Regulus was already trying to persuade Arnold.

The carriage carrying Shin and the others continued moving forward without stopping, but some of the spectators were glancing over at us.

<b>

The knights who had been entangled with Arnold bowed their heads toward the guild master, who was reflecting the sunlight beautifully, as if to say, "Look at this hair!" and returned to their posts.

<b>

"Right now, we are in the middle of a parade, so this is troublesome. I will convey Lord Arnold's feelings to the Thunderbolt's Trail."

<b>

Regulus said with a troubled smile, speaking as if to calm a child.

Although Arnold seems to be around twenty years old, to Regulus, he probably still appears to be a child. Well, his actions are more childish than his appearance.

<b>

"Is it really that bad? Just three minutes would be fine."

<b>

"I believe they will respond properly if we communicate with them."

<b>

"Hmm... a light mock battle wouldn't be a problem."

<b>

"…Right now, that's difficult."

<b>

Aren't we unnecessary? It seems like it's about to be resolved.

It seems Regulus could handle it alone, and judging by Arnold's words and expressions, there doesn't seem to be any sign of him going wild. He seems to be quite reasonable.

<b>

We were watching from a distance where we could hear the voices, and in the end, we just observed as Arnold was calmed down by Regulus and taken to the guild.

The commotion seems to be settling down, and I was thinking that chasing after the parade might be an option when,

<b>

"Huh?"

<b>

Just before the guild door closed, Regulus, who had tried to enter the building after Arnold, gestured to us in order of "beckoning" and "apology."

<b>

"It seems he wants to ask something."

<b>

Sera said, resting her chin on her hand, expressing her thoughts as she saw it. I think so too.

<b>

Now then, what on earth is Regulus trying to make us do?

For a few seconds, we stared at each other with question marks floating above our heads.

<b>

<b>

We were informed by the guild receptionist to return to the third-floor room where we had been watching the parade, so we quietly waited, predicting what kind of story would come our way.

Regulus has been quite helpful since before the collapse, and unless it's an overly troublesome matter, I intend to accept it. After all, he lent us this room.

<b>

About fifteen minutes later, Regulus finally appeared. It seems I see him with a tired expression more often than not.

He let out a big sigh and plopped down on the empty sofa. It seems he has no intention of maintaining appearances in front of us.

<b>

"I'm sorry for stopping you."

<b>

"No, I was able to see Shin and the others, and I didn't have any pressing matters to attend to—so, what is the matter?"

<b>

When I asked, Regulus scratched his head and opened his mouth apologetically.

<b>

"That person’s name is Arnold Vinzett—he is the third son of a count family. He is also one of the representatives of the Rezell Kingdom who participated in the International Martial Arts Tournament."

<b>

Oh, so he really did participate in the martial arts tournament.

<b>

"It seems he came all the way to the Lindell Kingdom alone because he wants to have a rematch with the Thunderbolt's Trail. Even if we are to meet the Thunderbolt's Trail, I have to take care of this guy until then."

<b>

Regulus seemed to be annoyed at having extra work piled on him and muttered in a complaining tone. He introduced him politely, but then referred to him as "this guy," revealing his frustration.

<b>

Upon listening closely, it seems he wants to delve into a B-rank dungeon where he can obtain elixirs.

<b>

Wanting to go to a dungeon rather than sightseeing in the city—perhaps we might get along well.

<b>

"It's difficult to leave it to the explorers around here, and there aren't many high-level individuals among the nobility either."

<b>

After hearing the story, Sera nodded as if she understood.

<b>

"So that's why we were called," said Fenon.

These two are undoubtedly top-class explorers in the noble society—probably the first and second best.

<b>

It seems that, not just in the Lindell Kingdom, but worldwide, "explorers' status doesn't matter" has become common knowledge, yet it is likely Regulus's sentiment to want to deal with nobility with nobility for the sake of friendly relations with other countries. Though having royalty involved feels a bit excessive.

<b>

"I also want to see how other countries' explorers measure up, so that's fine with me."

<b>

I checked the women's opinions, and everyone reluctantly indicated their agreement, as if to say it couldn't be helped.

<b>

"That's good, it helps."

<b>

Regulus let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

After that, we held a light meeting with the six of us, and for the time being, Regulus headed to the room where Arnold was waiting.

<b>

This time, Siri and Fenon stayed behind.

The princess seemed a bit dissatisfied, but since only five people can enter the dungeon, it couldn't be helped.

<b>

Having the first princess accompany us feels a bit excessive, and since Noah has mind-reading abilities, I want her to accompany us as a precaution.

Fenon and Siri cannot be separated due to their relationship, and Sera is in a similar position as a child of the same count family.

<b>

This was the result of various discussions, but while Fenon said, "Understood," she was puffing her cheeks.

<b>

We decided that while we delve into the dungeon, they would make contact with the Thunderbolt's Trail and take separate actions.

I can only hope that it ends up being just a dungeon exploration.

<b>

<b>

The three of us—me, Sera, and Noah—were guided by Regulus and headed nervously to the adjacent room where Arnold was waiting. However,

<b>

"What a refined beauty! Your beauty cannot be expressed in my clumsy words! Ah... your eyes are far more beautiful than the brilliance of jewels—comparing them to jewels feels presumptuous."

<b>

As soon as we entered the room, Arnold stood up from the sofa, knelt before us, and respectfully took the hand of a woman. The other two seemed not to be in his line of sight.

<b>

"Could you please tell me your name?"

<b>

As if it were a once-in-a-lifetime request, Arnold directed his earnest gaze toward my companion.

<b>

Caught off guard by such an unexpected development, I could only stand there dumbfounded.

<b>

Sera opened her mouth like a fish out of water, unable to make a sound.

Noah, with a strained face, glanced sideways at me as if to check my reaction.

<b>

Even with such looks, I had no idea what to do.

I've lived for nearly forty years, but I've never encountered a situation like this. In other words, I don't know how to handle it.

<b>

Even I, who could do nothing, understood one thing.

<b>

"My name is Noah."

<b>

—This guy is a lolicon!
