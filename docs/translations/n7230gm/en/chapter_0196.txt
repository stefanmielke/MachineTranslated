# A-79 Unclean!

<b>

<b>

Crescent and I performed a beautiful dogeza side by side in front of Shin and the others.

Well, if I said something like "I want to fight the strongest people in this country" after beating up those 'strongest people,' there was no other choice but to do so.

<b>

Originally, the field where the Cyclops was supposed to appear was filled with an awkward atmosphere, so I quickly chose to return. I decided to discuss how Crescent would spend her time from now on.

<b>

For some reason, we came out of the dungeon with six people, which left the receptionist looking puzzled, but when we asked her to "please pretend you didn't see anything," she nodded vigorously in agreement. Seeing this kind of reaction made me realize again that we are indeed famous.

<b>

"For now, we have more than enough money, so it's fine if we just laze around, but if Crescent dives into the dungeon, she could become rich in no time."

<b>

"That's true... From what I heard earlier, it seems like we haven't discovered all the drop items, right? Especially the S-rank ones. If we can get an elixir every day, we could live a luxurious life."

<b>

That's right. Even though the overall level of this world is rising, it's still developing. The trading price of elixirs is still quite high.

<b>

However, it's obvious that the price will eventually drop, so if we're going to earn, it should be now—though even without forcing it, Crescent is sure to become a billionaire. If she participated in betting matches, she could probably earn infinitely.

<b>

"You can come to the house we're living in until you settle down, but... how about you, Sera?"

<b>

When I asked Sera, who was walking next to me, she closed her eyes as if thinking for a moment before speaking.

<b>

"...That would be best. Even though Crescent is strong in battle, she must feel insecure since she just arrived in this world. She should act together with her fellow countrywoman, Sera. B-but! The bedroom is off-limits!"

<b>

"Ahahaha! It's fine! I definitely won't sneak into a married person's bed!"

<b>

"I-I see. Then Fenon probably won't complain."

<b>

"? --Who is this Fenon?"

<b>

Crescent tilted her head in confusion, alternating her gaze between me and Sera. Sera, receiving a questioning look, asked me, "Haven't you talked about Fenon yet?"

<b>

...Ugh, the topic has finally come up.

<b>

I had deliberately avoided mentioning it because I thought she would be put off if she heard about it, given that she grew up in Japan...

<b>

"Ah, that's right. It's about the princess we saved with the elixir earlier."

<b>

"? Why is that princess mentioning SR's relationships? The one who's married is Sera, right?"

<b>

That's true. It makes sense. If I were in Crescent's position, hearing that while still holding onto Japanese values, I would also have question marks floating in my mind.

<b>

"...Actually, I'm also married to Fenon."

<b>

"--Huh? W-what!? Married to a princess!? Are you two-timing!? SR, are you a harem guy!?"

<b>

"Don't say such malicious things! They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do! I have the means!"

<b>

"Wow! This person has become defensive! That's the lowest!"

<b>

"SR is not the lowest!"

<b>

"Is that support fire from the unexpected wife!? What do you think, Laika and Suzu!? It's unclean, right!?"

<b>

"Huh? Isn't it normal? For a man like SR, it's not strange to have more than ten women. After all, he's the strongest in the world, right?"

<b>

"Rather, it's too few right now. Well, I feel like there might be two more soon..."

<b>

Following Sera, the women from the Thunderbolt trajectory also supported me. I'm grateful, but Suzu—let's not speak about that last comment since it's still vague.

<b>

Crescent, under attack from the three of them, looked back at Shin, the last bastion, but perhaps sensing from Shin's visuals that he was popular, she let out a sigh as if giving up.

<b>

"I feel kind of disappointed."

<b>

"Maybe they think you should just explode."

<b>

"Why explode!?"

<b>

Well, in Japan, there's a saying that goes "real couples should explode." Just the fact that I'm in a party with two women is a giveaway. As for whether these girls will actually get married in the future, I have no idea.

<b>

"Hahaha... In this world, I'm the odd one out, so I guess I have to get used to it. But, Sera, weren't you a noble? If a princess and a noble are wives, does that mean the 'two' Suzu mentioned earlier are also high-status people? I'm starting to feel scared about going to SR's house..."

<b>

...Hmm.

<b>

It would be easy to say that Shiri is "Fenon's exclusive maid," but what about Noah's status... is it really a matter of status?

<b>

That brat seems like she would casually say she's a former god with a vibe of "I'm a former noble."

I could keep it hidden, but since her existence is essential to discussing my past in this world, I can't just ignore it. If I were to lie, I'd have to say Noah is dead or something, which wouldn't be good. I simply don't want to do that.

<b>

"...I'll introduce her when we meet."

<b>

For now, I said that and abandoned the explanation for this moment.

If Crescent never meets them for the rest of her life, there might be a possibility that I won't have to explain... right?
