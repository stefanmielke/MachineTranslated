# 79 The Pseudo-Malefactor

<b>

<b>

The enjoyable party, filled with drinking and dancing, continued late into the night.

<b>

This time, no one drowned in alcohol, and I did not have to find myself in a situation where I had to take care of some drunken fool. Whether that is fortunate or unfortunate, let us leave it to the gods to decide.

Everyone, regardless of status, cooperated to clean up the dishes and tables, welcoming the change of date in their respective rooms.

<b>

It was truly a fun day.

I hope the other six, besides myself, can fall asleep with the feeling of having had a 'great time.'

<b>

“—I’m so loved.”

<b>

Lying on my back in bed, I held up the charm engraved with Yukarimusubi towards the ceiling. Of course, my fingers were adorned with fingerless gloves.

If someone were to see this scene, they might tease me, saying, “Are you that happy?” but that is exactly the case, so I have no excuse. I must hide it quickly if I hear a knock.

<b>

“Hmm-hmm-hmm.”

<b>

I was in such a good mood that I unconsciously hummed a tune.

Since coming to this world, it has been nothing but fun.

<b>

I was indeed flustered when Phenon was threatened by illness, but now it feels like just another event.

<b>

“Obtain the elixir before the time limit!”—like a quest.

<b>

…My thought process is completely like that of when I’m playing a game. I thought I had understood long ago that this is reality.

<b>

“Recognizing a world with status as reality is a high hurdle for someone like me, a modern Japanese person.”

<b>

However, I never know when I might let my guard down and die while in a playful mood. What decreases from being scratched is not HP, but the blood flowing through my body.

<b>

And of course, the dead do not come back to life. This is reality.

<b>

“Maybe I shouldn’t challenge the SS rank dungeon…”

<b>

The greatest challenge in VRMMO Tempest, where the Overlord Venom appears.

This SS rank dungeon is different from other dungeons, lacking layers and featuring a castle as its stage.

Inside that Overlord's castle, only Venom, radiating an overwhelming presence, stands alone.

<b>

However, its difficulty is on a different dimension compared to the one rank lower, the S rank dungeon.

<b>

“If I happen to die, I would feel sorry for Sera and the others.”

<b>

I have only been able to defeat Overlord Venom alone once. After all, I came to this world right after defeating him.

And that victory was built upon thousands of defeats.

<b>

Regrettably, my win rate against Venom is likely below 0.1 percent.

<b>

But I have no intention of losing.

I am confident I will win. After all, I am the man who has reached the summit.

<b>

However, if I die, that will be the end.

<b>

“If I say I’m going to challenge it, Sera will definitely get angry. Phenon will probably have some unfounded confidence like, ‘You’ll be fine, Esuar!’”

<b>

I tried to imitate the voice of the tomboy princess in a falsetto and chuckled to myself. I laughed at how little I resembled her.

<b>

I really can’t do it.

I can’t imagine leaving this world behind without those two.

<b>

If I were to become engaged to them—and if I were to have children—

<b>

“The ones left behind would have it rough.”

<b>

I whispered in a voice as if to convince myself.

<b>

“Esuar will surely resent me.”

<b>

In the mirror reflecting the world, I see Esuar looking lovingly at the gifts from the party members. He touches the charm engraved with Yukarimusubi with a gentle hand, as if caressing a baby's cheek.

<b>

“I’m truly sorry.”

<b>

I am fully aware that this is not something that can be resolved with an apology. Even so, I bowed my head towards the mirror reflecting him.

<b>

Of course, Esuar cannot see me, so there is no reaction. The act of bowing my head is merely my own self-satisfaction.

<b>

“...I wonder if he’ll be okay.”

<b>

Can his mind endure the hellish future that awaits him?

It will likely be impossible for him to think normally.

I must intervene and somehow help him maintain his sanity. If I don’t, no one will be saved. No one will be rescued. No one will be rewarded.

<b>

“If I were in his position, I would undoubtedly hate him to the point of wanting to kill him.”

<b>

To take everything away. And to do so methodically.

Even though I thought of it myself, I can’t help but say that I lack an ethical perspective.

<b>

Moreover, even if Esuar manages to destroy Venom as I expect, all I can offer him is at most the right to be completely reborn.

Unlike the creator god of Earth, I am not that great of a god. I can only lament my lack of power.

<b>

“I’m really sorry.”

<b>

I uttered the words of apology once more.

I have no intention of apologizing when I face him. So, I bow my head as much as I want now.

I plan to face Esuar as an ‘evil’ so that I won’t be told, “If you’re going to apologize, don’t do it from the start.” I made that resolve long ago.

<b>

To keep the contract I made with the creator god of Earth, I had no choice but to do this. To prevent him from thinking, “I want to go back to Earth,” it was unavoidable. To make him risk his life to kill Venom, I had to take away something precious from him.

<b>

…But that’s just an excuse.

<b>

The truth is, I only want to be saved, yet I’m trying to justify my plan with sophistry. It’s a disgusting thought process.

<b>

The god of Earth, who cherishes his children, must be furious.

Surely that creator god sees through my thoughts as well.

<b>

“I’m counting on you.”

<b>

Soon, the residents of the world I created—the Thunderbolt’s Trace—will conquer the A rank dungeon. In other words, a hole will be opened in Venom’s seal, and the world will visibly begin to collapse.

I, who have been robbed of power by the overly powerful Venom, cannot resist.

<b>

His ‘precious’ is breaking.

<b>

But I believe in him.

I believe in Esuar’s strength more than Sera = Bernot.

I believe he will overcome this world without salvation and save this world.

<b>

A ‘Eye’ compatible individual, found in about one in five billion.

And the only and greatest challenge—an existence capable of defeating Venom ‘alone.’

<b>

<b>

It can only be him—yes, I am convinced of that.
