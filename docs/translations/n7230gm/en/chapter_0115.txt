# A-1 I Became an Older Brother

Thank you for waiting a long time.

I was busy preparing and refreshing myself, doing various things ┏○ Thank you.

The after story starts now!

<b>

~ From the first international martial arts tournament winner interview ~

<b>

<b>

"Now, finally, I would like to ask the members of 'Thunderbolt's Trail'! You have won the first-ever tournament held jointly by six countries—please share your current feelings!"

<b>

"Of course I'm happy. But well, for now, we're the only party that has conquered an A-rank dungeon, so I think it's a natural result."

<b>

"That's right. Since we are the discoverers of the derived secondary and tertiary jobs, it would be embarrassing if we lost here."

<b>

"I see... As expected of the party that received the title of 'Pioneer' from the Lindell royal family. So, does that mean the tournament felt a bit unsatisfying for you all?"

<b>

"Hey, hey, don't say things that would provoke the other participants who lost."

<b>

"Hahaha, my apologies for that. So, Lady Laika, how was this tournament for you?"

<b>

"Me? I had fun."

<b>

"Hmm, hmm, do you have any other thoughts?"

<b>

"Well... As Suzu said earlier, we are definitely above the other participants in terms of class and level, so I felt a bit like we were cheating."

<b>

"Ah, I can understand that feeling too."

<b>

"Same here."

<b>

"? I thought the classes chosen by everyone in this tournament weren't much different from the other participants..."

<b>

"Ah, well, that's true..."

<b>

"That aside, isn't it customary to ask about future goals in situations like this? Let's talk about that instead of levels."

<b>

"That's right! Please share your future plans as you have truly become the 'strongest in the world'! I'm sure the audience is also curious about it."

<b>

"The strongest... huh... I don't intend to be that, but for now, we will conquer the newly appeared S-rank dungeon."

<b>

"――――Wow, what an enthusiastic cheer. It seems many people have high expectations for the members of Thunderbolt's Trail. How confident are you?"

<b>

"Of course, I am confident. Just like with the A-rank dungeon, we will be the first to conquer the S-rank dungeon."

<b>

"That's right. It's frustrating to keep losing. I want to level up quickly."

<b>

"――Huh!? W-wait a moment!! Is there someone stronger than the members of Thunderbolt's Trail!? Is it someone from the Lindell Kingdom!?"

<b>

"Eh――Ah!?"

<b>

"This is a major scoop! I can't imagine a rival who could keep up with the overwhelming victory of Lord Shin! What is their name!?"

<b>

"(Ah, ah, I won't take responsibility if I get scolded. Laika, I’ll report to SR just in case.)"

<b>

"(That seems like a good idea. That person was finally happy to not stand out... Seriously. If I report Shin's blunder, I might have to endure some harsh training again.)"

<b>

"(Yes, yes. No doubt about it.)"

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"――Achoo!"

<b>

"Are you okay, SR? You don't seem to be feeling unwell."

<b>

"I'm fine, fine. My nose just suddenly got itchy."

<b>

I wonder if someone is talking about me.

<b>

Well, most of the people who know me are here right now, so that's unlikely.

The members of Thunderbolt's Trail are probably busy with the international tournament right now, so they wouldn't have time to talk about me.

Regulus seems to be busy with work now that the S-rank dungeon has appeared.

<b>

"Maybe Shin let something slip without thinking?"

<b>

Noah, sitting next to me with her hand over her mouth, laughs. She has really started to show a good expression.

I mean, she should stop reading people's minds without permission.

<b>

Currently, in this familiar living room, there are four of us: me, Noah, and Sera and Fenon, while Shiri is in the kitchen preparing new tea and coffee.

<b>

"If it were Shin, he might accidentally say something... Well, if he did, I’d send him to charge into an A-rank dungeon alone."

<b>

"Hahaha, that would be tough for him right now."

<b>

"That's why it's good."

<b>

<b>

About a month has passed since we defeated Venom and peace returned to the world. In other words, it has been a month since I fully reincarnated into this world.

<b>

There have been various changes, regardless of the fact that the noja loli, Lady Idea, has taken over the management of this world.

<b>

One major change is that my notoriety has become nonexistent, making it difficult for me to marry Fenon.

Sera has now been given the title of 'Sword Princess' and holds a status far beyond that of a typical count's daughter.

<b>

Neither Sera nor Fenon, including myself, are in a hurry to say "Marriage! Marriage! Let's get married right now!" We are planning to steadily build our foundation.

<b>

Currently, only Noah and I are staying in this house, while Fenon and the others are building a new house in the city of Reinas and spending their nights there.

<b>

However, considering Fenon's high status, that alone is not enough. It’s difficult to spend time in the same space during the day as just a common villager. In other words, a reason is needed.

<b>

If my gender were the same as theirs, I wouldn't need to go through such tricks...

<b>

"I've already gotten used to it. Onii-chan♪"

<b>

Why are you so happy? You're technically a goddess. Besides, there's no need to say that even inside the house.

<b>

"It's practice, practice. It's better to unify it regularly so I don't accidentally call you 'SR-kun' outside, right?"

<b>

Ugh... You have a point.

<b>

Now, Noah, who is a member of Sera's party.

I am in a position as Noah's brother, which is why I have been allowed by the Lindell royal family and the Bernot count family.

<b>

It would have been fine if it were just Sera, but that’s still not enough for Fenon. After all, she is a princess.

So, I had Regulus and Thunderbolt's Trail explain to Dino that "SR is not a problem," and finally, I can relax like this.

<b>

If it were to be revealed that we are not actually siblings... No, I shouldn't think about it. The thought of execution is too scary.

<b>

As I let out a deep sigh, the two people sitting across the table from me were staring at me with clearly sulky expressions.

<b>

"Noah, don't you think you're a bit too close to SR-san?"

<b>

I thought so too, but Fenon... that smile is really scary, so please stop.

<b>

"That's right! He is our—h-h-husband, you know!"

<b>

Sera, if your ears are turning bright red, you don't have to say it. It's making me embarrassed too.

<b>

"But we haven't officially married yet, right? I have officially become his sister, so isn't it normal?"

<b>

"“Ugh... That's true.””

<b>

"No, that's not it! It's not that I've officially become a sister! Sera and Fenon, don't accept this flimsy setup!"

<b>

"Y-You're right!"

<b>

"That was a blind spot!"

<b>

The two of them change their expressions and tones of voice rapidly.

It's amusing to watch, but since I'm involved, I can't just sit back and enjoy the show.

<b>

Now, how should I resolve this somewhat tense atmosphere?

As I began to think while sweating profusely, the goddess in a maid outfit descended.

<b>

"Thank you for waiting! —Everyone, what were you talking about? It seemed lively!"

<b>

Approaching the table with a tray holding cups of tea and coffee, she exudes a soft and fluffy atmosphere.

It feels like Shiri's arrival has softened the air in this entire space. Truly a goddess!

<b>

...As I was thinking that,

<b>

"Wow... Onii-chan calls Shiri 'goddess' in his heart. Yet he often calls me 'brat' as the former creator god."

<b>

With Noah's words, the atmosphere instantly froze.

One shy upward glance and three glaring looks.

<b>

The only one who seems to support me, Shiri, placed a teacup in front of me, saying, "I-I brought coffee!" while her voice cracked. But this is tea.

<b>

"Hahaha..."

<b>

For now, I laugh it off.

It's peaceful that people can enjoy love and romance without suddenly disappearing. Yes, peaceful.

<b>

<b>

The gazes are very painful, but it is peaceful nonetheless.
