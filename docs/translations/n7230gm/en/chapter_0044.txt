# 42 Three-way?

<b>

<b>

<b>

The letter I received from Regulus-san had a line that said, "Please go easy on me," but wouldn't that line alone be enough to prove his abilities?

<b>

His real brother—someone who seems to be a trustworthy figure, having taken on the role of Guild Master in the royal capital. His words should carry enough weight.

<b>

I thought so, but,

<b>

"…I am the Guild Master responsible for the lives of the explorers. We cannot afford any accidents, so let me confirm this with my own eyes."

<b>

After much deliberation, it seems that Lailes-san decided to have a mock battle with me.

Although we don't look much alike, his personality seems to be hot-blooded like his brother's.

<b>

"Understood. What kind of match will it be?"

<b>

"How about a best-of-ten match? If I win even once, we can forget about this discussion. In other words, I won't grant you permission to enter the dungeon."

<b>

"What!? That's outrageous!"

<b>

Upon hearing the conditions Lailes-san stated, Shiri-san couldn't help but exclaim.

<b>

"That's right. It really is outrageous—what he said about 'facing a B-rank dungeon monster alone.' It should be difficult unless you can easily defeat something like that, like I can."

<b>

He said this while sending me a glance to gauge my reaction.

<b>

Hmm, I don't see any problem on my end.

If the highest level reached is the third layer of a B-rank dungeon, then his abilities are likely below those of Shin and the others, so winning should be easy.

<b>

What I'm thinking about isn't the win or loss, but how to win.

<b>

Just winning isn't enough.

It's not like I need to do it, but if I'm told to overwhelm him, then I'll do just that—perhaps it's pride as someone who has reigned at the top.

<b>

"Alright. Shall we do it now?"

<b>

Objectively speaking, I think I am currently filled with fighting spirit. I must have a fierce look in my eyes.

It's different from leveling up—it's like the feeling I had when I fought the Cyclops for the princess in the B-rank dungeon.

I was called 'crazy' by the Lightning Trail, but—indeed, I might be a battle maniac.

<b>

"No, no, wait a minute. I'm just waking up, and I have work piling up due to the new job and rule changes. How about around 3 PM?"

<b>

"………………"

<b>

"Don't give me such a resentful look."

<b>

"………………"

<b>

"I'm actually hurrying, you know?"

<b>

"……………… Fine."

<b>

Reluctantly, with a truly reluctant response, Lailes-san let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"I'm glad you could come to an agreement. You all just arrived in this city, right? By the time you have lunch and stroll around, it'll be around 4 PM."

<b>

"It's 3 PM."

<b>

"—Was that not good? Alright, I'll have everything ready by 3 PM."

<b>

"Thank you."

<b>

I bowed my head and expressed my gratitude.

<b>

From Lailes-san's perspective, we must seem like bothersome people who suddenly showed up while he was taking a nap, demanding special treatment. Moreover, we brought along the first princess and even a letter from a duke's family.

It's truly a case of pushing through with power. Please don't take it the wrong way.

<b>

The big sigh I heard as I exited the room was surely an unconscious one. The four of us chose to ignore it and left the Explorer's Guild.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hmm… Is it really okay to casually stroll around the city?"

<b>

After leaving the guild, I asked Fenon-san.

Of course, I didn't use her name to avoid drawing attention to her as a princess.

Before we left the private room in the guild, Fenon-san and Sera had already disguised themselves with magical tools.

<b>

Although not as crowded as around the guild, it was still bustling, as expected of a commercial city. The atmosphere is quite different from the town I knew when I was playing the game.

The layout of the town is almost the same, but the materials and types of buildings are all unfamiliar to me in Reinas.

<b>

"There's no problem. I haven't been able to come recently due to illness, but I've often disguised myself to go out into the city since long ago."

<b>

I glanced at Shiri-san, asking with my eyes, "Is that so?" She nodded with a wry smile. She seems to be having a tough time.

<b>

"What about Sera?"

<b>

"I used to come shopping with my father and—my brother often. This place has items not found in the royal capital, and there are also hidden gems. Well, that's a story from the past."

<b>

"Hmm… Is your brother referring to Rei-san?"

<b>

"Why does Esaar know that? I don't recall mentioning it."

<b>

"I heard it from Shin. When I asked if there were any other strong people in this country, your name came up."

<b>

As I answered, Sera murmured, "I see," with a wry smile.

<b>

While I was having such a conversation with Sera, the spirited princess took my right hand. The unfamiliar soft sensation made my body tense up instantly.

<b>

"W-What’s wrong?"

<b>

"If we're going to talk, let's do it while sightseeing in the city. I'll guide you."

<b>

That's not what I meant. Even if you come on that strong, I'm not used to women, so it's a bit troubling!

<b>

Moreover, while it's fine when it's just the two of us, Shiri-san and Sera are also here.

Please consider how it feels to be on the side of watching you two getting all lovey-dovey!

<b>

I thought that, but,

<b>

"Sera, hold my left hand."

<b>

To my surprise, Fenon-san tried to have my other hand held by my friend. What is this? Is she suggesting a three-way relationship?

<b>

It's not good to be suddenly grabbed like that; I hurriedly wiped the sweat from my left hand on my pants.

—However, Sera did not take my hand.

<b>

"My hands are rough, so I'll pass."

<b>

Saying that with a wry smile, Fenon-san observed her friend as if watching for a reaction.

I felt a bit rejected. Not that I confessed or anything.

<b>

"Then what about Shiri?"

<b>

"Me!? N-No, that's too much for me."

<b>

The beautiful maid, not wearing her maid outfit, waved her hands in front of her face. That simple gesture looks so adorable just because she does it.

<b>

"You've held my hand before."

<b>

"That's because Fenon-sama quickly goes somewhere—"

<b>

"Hmm. So you say that."

<b>

"—N-No! It's because I was anxious, so I asked to hold your hand!"

<b>

"I'm just joking."

<b>

Seeing Shiri-san flustered, Fenon-san chuckled.

<b>

Princess… Those with power shouldn't make light-hearted jokes.

Look at her. Sweat of a different kind is flowing from her forehead.

<b>

Shiri-san had a much more composed demeanor when she was in the royal castle, but perhaps this is her true self?

Maybe she’s gradually letting her guard down around me and Sera.

Whether that's a good change or a bad one, I don't know.

<b>

<b>

With a gentle expression, Sera looks at us as we hold hands.

<b>

Shiri-san lets out a sigh of relief while streaming cold sweat.

<b>

Fenon-san smiles happily, tightly gripping my hand.

<b>

And while I watch these three with a wry smile.

<b>

<b>

Well then, shall we casually explore the city of Reinas until 3 PM?

Depending on how you look at it, it might seem like a date, but if I were to call this a date, I would surely fall into hell.

After all, I'm surrounded by such beautiful women and lovely girls, so it can't be helped.

<b>

Imagining a future where I bow my head to King Enma and apologize, "I'm sorry for having a three-way relationship," I was led by Fenon-san and began to walk through the commercial city of Reinas.
