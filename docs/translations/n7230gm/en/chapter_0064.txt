Chapter Three, Opening!!

<b>

Looking back, I had known it long ago.

<b>

From the very day I was reborn, I knew that this world was broken.

<b>

However, because I couldn't recognize it as "broken," I had not realized it until now.

<b>

――I couldn't notice it until it was too late.

<b>

I couldn't realize it until the day I lost someone important.

<b>

A month has passed since the martial arts tournament ended.

Our nameless party continues to visit C-rank dungeons, using the doghouse of the royal castle as our base. The purpose is to help Fenon get accustomed to dungeons and to gauge Shiri's skills.

<b>

I was enjoying the interaction with the three of them while providing guidance based on my experience.

<b>

As a result, our levels have been steadily rising, and the three of them—Sera, Shiri, and Fenon—have each raised their secondary classes to level 30 and have obtained player bonuses.

In my case, I have been diving into B-rank dungeons in between, allowing me to raise the levels of my heavy knight and sage to 30.

<b>

Currently, I am a magic archer.

My level is low, but thanks to the player bonus, my stats are vastly different compared to when I first came to this world.

<b>

☆Status☆

<b>

Name: SR

Age: 18

Occupation: Magic Archer

Level: 7

STR: D

VIT: D

AGI: E

DEX: D

INT: D

MND: F

Skills: Stealth, Projectile Magic

<b>

Stealth is a skill of archers, and projectile magic is a skill of mages.

Well, I still spend my days slicing enemies with the red sword given to me by Duke Drag, without using my skills.

<b>

"Lord SR, do you have any plans for tomorrow?"

<b>

After dinner, Fenon suddenly said.

Shiri insisted, "This is my job!" and was cleaning up the dishes for four all by herself.

I felt a bit guilty, but since she was getting paid for this, I decided to just thank her instead of taking her job.

<b>

Tomorrow is a day off for our party activities, so I had planned to lounge around at home and head to the dungeon as soon as I got bored...

<b>

"I don't have any specific plans. Why do you ask?"

<b>

"It's not a big deal, but my father wants to talk to you, Lord SR, and he has cleared his schedule for tomorrow."

<b>

Your father—it's His Majesty! That's a big deal!

Moreover, if he has cleared his schedule just to talk to me, there's no way I can refuse as an ordinary citizen. Wait, am I not an ordinary citizen because I have a title? I still don't quite understand that part.

<b>

"I'll go! I'll definitely go! I will be honored to attend!"

<b>

I responded with unnecessary enthusiasm. I hope they forgive me for being a bit loud.

<b>

"Thank you. My father will surely be pleased."

<b>

Fenon smiled brightly.

Her original features are nothing short of magnificent, and her smile is incredibly charming. It makes me doubt if I really am liked by such a cute girl.

<b>

From what I've heard, His Majesty summoned me to hear my opinions on the progress of dungeon exploration and future plans.

<b>

Wouldn't it have been fine to just ask me about the Thunderbolt Trail? I wonder if His Majesty thinks I have greatly contributed to conquering B-rank dungeons? Even if Lord Dino hasn't leaked our circumstances, it wouldn't be surprising if His Majesty, who summoned me, has noticed.

<b>

"Um, SR?"

<b>

"Hm? What is it?"

<b>

This time, Sera called out to me, hesitantly and somewhat awkwardly.

<b>

"Actually, my father also wants to talk to you. I'll let you know the date later, so please take care of it then."

<b>

Following His Majesty, now it's Count's turn...

Though his position is weaker than the king or duke, he is still a noble. Naturally, I feel nervous.

<b>

"That's fine, but... do you know what the matter is?"

<b>

When I asked, she frowned as if troubled.

<b>

"I've told him that I'm staying here, and he mentioned wanting to thank you regarding the tax exemption in the Bernault territory, but to be honest, I'm not sure. He hasn't particularly reached out to Shin and the others who conquered the B-rank dungeon with us."

<b>

"Hmm... I wonder what it could be? Maybe he wants to check if his daughter is being courted by any strange bugs?"

<b>

"SR is not a bug! He is a proper human!"

<b>

Well, I am human! But that's not what I meant!

<b>

"Isn't he just worried about whether you're getting involved with some weird guy? Parents worry, you know."

<b>

"Is that so? I-I-I don't have any such intentions, but if that were the case, with SR, it should be fine. After all, he has the endorsement of Fenon and His Majesty."

<b>

You sound like a broken tin toy. You're overreacting to a hypothetical situation.

<b>

Watching my friend, who has gone a bit crazy, I chuckled as Fenon affirmed, "That's right."

<b>

"If there are any complaints about Lord SR, even if it's the Count—"

<b>

"Please spare me from that."

<b>

"Hehe—just kidding."

<b>

Sera looked exasperated, while Fenon laughed happily.

That's scary. What on earth was she about to say?

<b>

Sera is probably used to these kinds of exchanges. She mentioned that they've known each other since childhood.

Look at Shiri and me. We're sweating bullets, intimidated by the power of royalty.

<b>

In a whisper, I leaned closer to Shiri, who was cleaning the dishes.

<b>

"When it comes to power, it's hard for us to interject, isn't it?"

<b>

She shrank her neck as if tickled, looked into my eyes, and then gave me a puzzled expression. Then, she smiled and said,

<b>

"Lord SR, you are also a power holder like Sera and the others, you know? Please be aware of that."

<b>

Behind her gentle face, a dark side peeked through. I felt as if she was subtly telling me, "Don't compare yourself to us." I'm sorry.

<b>

<b>

They returned to their respective homes, and I was left alone in the spacious house. It was a design that allowed me to fully savor loneliness. It could be written as "heartbroken design."

<b>

"The timing is just right."

<b>

Lying on the bed, I recalled the conversations I had with the two today.

Originally, I had planned to greet His Majesty and Count Bernault while making "a certain request."

<b>

I don't intend to say, "Please give me your daughter!"

<b>

Since I had been able to teach Fenon and Shiri to some extent, I wanted to move my base closer to the B-rank dungeon where the status-up rings drop—specifically, to the city of Renus.

<b>

Since I plan to stay for a long time, I decided to buy a house. Whether to look for an empty house or build one from scratch is undecided, but relocating my base is a certainty.

<b>

In other words, the plan is to take Fenon, Sera, and Shiri out of the royal capital and live together.

Since Shiri serves Fenon, there shouldn't be any issues regarding her, but I want to get the parents' approval for the princesses so that it doesn't become a problem later.

<b>

If it's not possible, we might end up living in separate houses, but it would be less stressful to live together than to meet up every day.

If their houses are nearby, it wouldn't be a problem, but there isn't much benefit to living separately in another town.

<b>

"I wonder what kind of house would be good... yawn."

<b>

A hinoki bath would be nice... I wonder if hinoki exists in this world? Well, I wouldn't mind any similar wood.

<b>

I also want a wooden deck.

I want to relax while sipping coffee in a rocking chair.

<b>

I have plenty of money, and even if I run short, selling elixirs should solve the problem.

Whether I live with them or not, if I want to fulfill various requests, it seems better to build from scratch.

<b>

I'm looking forward to it.
