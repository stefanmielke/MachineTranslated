# A-14 Arnold-Vinzet

<b>

<b>

<b>

Noah, who lives in this world, has an overwhelmingly high mental age compared to others. She doesn't tell her exact age, but it wouldn't be surprising if she had lived for billions of years. After all, she's a god.

<b>

However, despite her inner self, she looks like a late elementary school student, and recently her behavior has become more childlike.

I won't say it to her face, but her appearance is beautifully arranged, as she can create it freely, and if she were to attend an elementary school on Earth, she would surely have been quite popular.

Noah with a backpack—surprisingly fitting.

<b>

That aside.

<b>

Sera and I managed to calm Arnold, whose eyes were heart-shaped, and had him sit on the sofa placed in the center of the room. We sat on the opposite sofa, with Sera in the center.

When I glanced at Noah, she still wore a bitter expression. Apparently, he is not her type.

<b>

"So, I heard you want to go to a B-rank dungeon?"

<b>

After each of us briefly introduced ourselves, Sera spoke as if the earlier events had never happened. I also wanted to pretend I hadn't seen anything. It seemed like a hassle.

<b>

Arnold, addressed by Sera, shifted his gaze from Noah and faced us. His eyes were no longer heart-shaped.

<b>

"That's correct. I actually wanted to have a rematch with the Thunderbolt's Trail, but it seems there isn't enough time. The Rezel Kingdom has also been greatly helped by the Elixir of the Lindel Kingdom, so I definitely want to obtain it by my own power. ...That said, I heard from the guild master that a capable party would guide me—"

<b>

I never expected it would be ASR—he said, wearing a pleased smile.

Whether he heard about us from the international tournament or knew beforehand is unclear, but it seems he is aware of us.

<b>

"I also know about Esuar. I heard you have been trained by the Thunderbolt's Trail."

<b>

It seems he even knew about me.

Even if he couldn't match my face and name, I'm the only man in the ASR party, so it must be easy to figure out.

<b>

"Well, that's true. I can't compete with the female members of my party, but I'm doing my best."

<b>

"Well, it's just that the opponent is tough."

<b>

Saying that, Arnold laughed amicably.

He doesn't seem like a bad guy after all. He doesn't give off much of a noble vibe and speaks in a friendly manner.

<b>

He continued speaking while keeping his gaze on me.

<b>

"Right now, I am here not as a noble of the Rezel Kingdom, but as an explorer. There's no need for formal language."

<b>

"Just no charges of disrespect later, okay?"

<b>

"Hahaha! I won't say that. I've never punished anyone in my life. Besides, if I act like a noble, I might be forced to inherit the family estate. I'll leave the troublesome matters to my older brothers."

<b>

Is that a problem unique to nobles?

It seems that there are women who become heads of households in this world, so perhaps Sera has faced similar issues... Thinking that, I glanced at Sera beside me, and she was just stifling a yawn, making a very strange face.

I'll pretend I didn't see that.

<b>

"If that's the case... understood. Nice to meet you, Arnold."

<b>

"Yes, likewise, I look forward to working with you."

<b>

Saying that, we firmly shook hands—but then Arnold's movements suddenly stopped.

He looked at my hand that he was gripping, then at my face—and then back at my hand.

<b>

"It seems you've undergone tremendous training. I heard you were the support role of the party, but... it seems you truly are a member of the second-best party of the Lindel Kingdom."

<b>

? ...Ah, he judged by my calluses. Even though I heal with Heal, my hands have become quite tough from being crushed multiple times.

<b>

"Anyone who swings a sword would have hands like this."

<b>

"Hmph, let's leave it at that."

<b>

Whether we leave it at that or not, I think anyone handling a sword would end up like this... but whatever. The only difference between me and others is that I repeatedly crushed and healed my hands in a relatively short period, but I wonder if someone who understands would notice that. I don't know.

<b>

After finishing the handshake with me, Arnold turned his body toward Noah. His mouth had a serious atmosphere, but his eyes instantly switched to heart shapes.

<b>

"I, of course, knew about Lady Noah. However, I didn't expect her to be such a beautiful person... It is an honor to meet you."

<b>

"Wh-why am I the only one being addressed formally? Talk to me like you do with my brother and Sera!"

<b>

Not liking being treated specially, Noah said with a strained voice while laughing.

Arnold, who was addressed like that by his beloved, tilted his head and asked, "Brother?" Apparently, he didn't know about the sibling setting.

<b>

"Noah is my sister."

<b>

Though she's a fake.

Arnold's eyes widened, and his mouth dropped open.

<b>

"What!? Is that so!? If that's the case, you should have told me, brother-in-law!"

<b>

"Who the hell is 'brother-in-law'! I'll knock you out!"

<b>

"I will make Lady Noah happy!"

<b>

"Shut up, you lolicon!"

<b>

I don't know if this will get through to him, but I just had to shout it out.

—However, judging by the puzzled expressions of Sera and Arnold, they probably didn't understand. Well, it doesn't really matter if they don't.

<b>

Speaking of which, I hadn't heard a clear opinion from Noah herself, but I wonder how she feels about it? If Noah is interested, I would support her—thinking that, I looked at Noah over Sera's shoulder, and she was glaring at me with a sharp gaze. She seemed quite angry.

<b>

Why is she glaring at me?

<b>

When I questioned in my mind, Noah sniffed and turned her head away.

I think there was something in my thoughts that she didn't like, but I have no idea what it was.

<b>

It feels uncomfortable to leave it like this, so I might ask her about it once the Arnold situation settles down.
