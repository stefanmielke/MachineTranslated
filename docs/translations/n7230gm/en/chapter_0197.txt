# A-80 Self-Proclaimed Little Sister Appears

<b>

<b>

<b>

After returning to the royal capital with Crescent and reuniting with Fenon and Shiri at the party house, Crescent, who had been relatively normal with Sera, seemed to feel quite differently now that she was in front of a princess, acting both nervous and polite.

<b>

It seemed that Shin and the others from the Thunder's Trajectory sensed the fatigue from the battle with Crescent and the atmosphere of trouble, and they parted ways in front of the party house, heading somewhere else. They said, "We have things to do, haha," but there was definitely no such thing. They just ran away.

<b>

Then, Noah appeared in the living room wearing a childish nightcap, and when I explained to Crescent that she was the former goddess of this world,

<b>

"Fuh, she's totally normal! A completely ordinary little girl from any angle!"

<b>

"Well, she may look that way, but as I mentioned, I'm the former goddess and your big brother's little sister!"

<b>

"............"

<b>

I was met with a look of disdain. Her eyes seemed to say that not only was there a harem, but she also had such tastes.

<b>

"No, no, this brat is just saying whatever—well, it's not just that, but that's the setting!"

<b>

"This person just started talking about settings... My impression of Esuar is heading in a bad direction."

<b>

"Stop looking at me like that right now! I can't make it public that she's a goddess, so for now, she’s just registered here! And it was her who brought it up!"

<b>

"This goddess said she wanted to be a little sister, huh..."

<b>

"That's right. I'm not at fault here."

<b>

As I explained this, Sera, Fenon, and Shiri nodded in agreement, but Noah had a look on her face as if she had found an interesting toy, alternating her gaze between me and Crescent.

<b>

"I've been watching you all fight from the outside the whole time. I didn't see every little detail, but I definitely kept an eye on Crescent-chan, who was ranked first individually, even when she wasn't fighting."

<b>

Noah added, "Well, the one I watched the most was your big brother," but Crescent froze with a strained smile. I could clearly see the blood draining from her face.

<b>

"W-was that, um, also about what was happening outside of Tempest?"

<b>

Crescent asked Noah, looking nervous. The brat's response was a teasing, "Of course!"

<b>

"Ahh! It's over! My life is over! I'll kill this goddess and die too!"

<b>

"Hey, hey, calm down. Why are you panicking so much? I know about my past as a shut-in NEET, but I don't plan to die over it. It's my second life, so I have to cherish it."

<b>

You could also say I'm being defiant.

<b>

"That's not it! It's not like that!"

<b>

"Crescent-chan really admires her big brother, and after he disappeared, she was crying under the covers, you know? And then she secretly—"

<b>

"Stop! No more! In fact, even before that is off-limits!"

<b>

It felt like the master-servant relationship had been established in an instant, but more than that, I was curious about the part where Crescent cried after I disappeared from Tempest. Even though we hadn't talked much, did she feel lonely as a long-time gaming partner? I didn't quite understand the meaning of the last part.

<b>

Seeing Crescent in shock, Shiri smiled gently and said, "I'll prepare some tea," heading towards the kitchen. If it were Shin, I would definitely think, "He ran away!" but since it's Shiri, it was probably a hundred percent kind-hearted action.

<b>

Then, Fenon, her master and companion, bridged the gap.

<b>

"Crescent-san, you've known Esuar-san for a while, right?"

<b>

"Y-yes. Th-that's true, but... did I offend you?"

<b>

She wasn't speaking well, and her manner of speaking had become quite confused. Well, it might be understandable since she was suddenly thrown in front of the imperial family. As for Noah, she was so far beyond Crescent's imagination that it seemed to make her feel more at ease.

<b>

Fenon gently reassured her, "You don't have to worry about it in public," but the one being told that was so flustered it was embarrassing to watch.

I guess I have to step in since I'm the one who has known her the longest.

<b>

"For now, Crescent just got here and is probably confused, so you want some time alone, right? You can use the bath, so go relax there. If you have any questions, just ask me whenever."

<b>

"Whenever!? You don't mean you plan to take a bath together, do you!? That's sexual harassment! I knew it! Esuar-san is a harem guy! I know it! Bringing me home and saying, 'Go take a shower,' is a signal for that!"

<b>

"That's not it, you idiot."

<b>

She really is someone whose thoughts can easily run wild.

Well, compared to Fenon, Sera, and Shiri, I can interact with her in a similar way to Noah, so it makes me feel a bit more at ease.
