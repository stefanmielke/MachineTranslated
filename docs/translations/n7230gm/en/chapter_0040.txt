# 38 Journey

<b>

<b>

<b>

There is a level above 80――Upon hearing those words, Shin and the others were momentarily stunned before leaning forward and questioning, "What does that mean!?"

<b>

Since revealing the answer right away would be boring, I said, "After the martial arts tournament," to deflect, and sent them home.

I am aware that I did something a bit mean. I do not regret it. If you want to blame someone, blame this world.

<b>

After that, around noon, Fenon-san and Shiri-san appeared.

<b>

Fenon-san was wearing a black knee-length skirt and a gray Y-shirt. Her hair was dyed pitch black by a magical tool and tied into a single bun at the nape of her neck. Considering her usual appearance, the overall color scheme was completely opposite.

As Sera said, I also thought that with this, she wouldn't be recognized as a princess.

<b>

And the beautiful maid, Shiri-san.

She was not wearing her usual maid outfit, but black hot pants and a T-shirt that was short enough to show her belly, with a black jacket over it.

<b>

The firm, pure white thighs that were not visible when she was in her maid outfit were somewhat criminal. In the sense that looking at them would make me feel like a criminal.

<b>

Unlike Fenon-san, her outfit, compared to the color of the maid uniform she used to wear, was not much different from her usual style. However, the genre of clothing was so different that it felt like a completely different atmosphere.

She transformed from a cute impression to that of a cool adult woman.

<b>

After that, Sera, whose outfit was the same as usual but whose hair color had changed to dark brown, also arrived, and all the members were gathered. We boarded the carriage that Shiri-san had arranged for us and departed from the royal capital.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"It was late for Sera. I had the impression that she always came early."

<b>

"I came after confirming with the guild master about the martial arts tournament. I apologize for making you wait."

<b>

"Even so, it was earlier than the scheduled time. So you don’t need to apologize; thank you for your hard work."

<b>

<b>

The carriage that Shiri-san prepared was not shabby, but it was simple enough that one would not think it was for nobles or royalty. Perhaps if it were too flashy, they would realize we were upper-class nobles.

<b>

That said, the carriage itself seemed quite sturdy, and the horse pulling it had a coat that reflected the sunlight, giving an elegant impression. The coachman was likely also someone related to the royal castle.

<b>

Inside the carriage, there was enough space for about ten people to sit, with soft cushions laid out.

Sera and I were sitting next to each other, while Fenon-san and Shiri-san were sitting across from us.

<b>

Since we were progressing along a well-maintained highway, the shaking inside the carriage was minimal and hardly noticeable unless one paid attention.

<b>

Sera suddenly took out an envelope from her inventory, pinched it between her index and middle fingers so that everyone could see, and said,

<b>

"I received a letter when I went to the guild. It was said to be for my brother."

<b>

"Brother...? That’s fine, but... is he acquainted with Sera?"

<b>

Even if I was suddenly told to give it to her brother, it would be difficult to search for him without knowing his face or name.

As I tilted my head in confusion, Shiri-san answered as if to supplement.

<b>

"Regulus-san's brother――Lailes-san is the guild master of the Explorer Guild, Leinas branch."

<b>

"Oh... both brothers are guild masters, that's impressive."

<b>

"Both possess charisma and skill to lead others. It seems their reputation is good as well."

<b>

"I heard that the guild master's brother has also reached the third level of a B-rank dungeon."

<b>

Now that I think about it, Regulus-san said he reached the same level too.

Wasn't he a level 80 heavy knight? Perhaps he was in the same party as Lailes-san. If so, Lailes-san must be an attacker class?

<b>

Speaking of which, about the B-rank dungeon――,

<b>

"Is it true that the B-rank dungeon in Leinas is sealed? I want to go there."

<b>

According to the story of the Thunderbolt's Trail, it was said, "It should be fine," but I couldn't shake off the anxiety with just those words. I really hope this long journey won't be in vain.

When I asked Sera, she smiled slyly, just like Shin and the others.

<b>

"I've heard that Duke Margus has sealed it――but it should be no problem for Esuar."

<b>

Why is it no problem? That's why I'm asking.

<b>

"I think so too. After all, it’s Lord Esuar."

<b>

Following Sera, even Fenon-san said such things.

Princess... that doesn't answer anything, you know?

<b>

Perhaps because I was pouting, Fenon-san elegantly chuckled and added more words.

<b>

"As a hint, currently, Duke Margus is facing a certain problem. And Lord Esuar should be able to solve that problem quite easily."

<b>

"If I solve that problem, will they allow me to delve into the B-rank dungeon?"

<b>

"Yes, Duke Margus is a man of his word. If you ask Lord Esuar, I believe he will grant permission without hesitation."

<b>

"......I see."

<b>

In the end, the same vague feelings remained as when I talked with Shin and the others.

I hope it’s fine, but I feel completely unsatisfied! I even think it would have been better not to ask!

<b>

"You mentioned before that you were going to level up in a B-rank dungeon, but will it be fine in the Leinas dungeon as well?"

<b>

Perhaps feeling pity for me being teased, Shiri-san gently changed the topic. Is she an angel?

I fixed my gaze on her face to avoid looking at her thighs and replied in a calm tone. I felt like Fenon-san's gaze had sharpened, but it must be my imagination.

<b>

"To be honest, I wanted to stock up on a few more elixirs, but since it’s not urgent, the Leinas dungeon will be fine. The types of monsters will change, but the difficulty is the same."

<b>

"I will support you with my bow!"

<b>

I appreciate the sentiment, but that’s impossible.

<b>

"Shiri-san will be going in at level 1 of a lower class, so you won't be able to deal damage against the monsters in the B-rank dungeon."

<b>

"Y-You're right... I'll make sure not to be a hindrance."

<b>

"You'll have your chance to shine eventually, so until then, please rest well."

<b>

"Lord Esuar! I will do my best to be of help someday!"

<b>

"Yes. I expect the same from Fenon-san――and of course from Sera as well."

<b>

Saying that, I turned my gaze to the side.

However, she was staring blankly ahead with unfocused eyes, and there was no sign of her responding to my voice.

<b>

"Sera?"

<b>

When I called out again, she replied, "Ah, yeah... that's right," in a way that made it hard to tell if she was listening or not, and gave a vague smile.

<b>

I wonder if she was lost in thought? Perhaps about family issues?

I thought it might get a little better once we left the royal capital... but it hasn’t changed much.

<b>

<b>

After that, we spent our time playing cards that Shiri-san had brought and enjoying the scenery outside until we arrived in Leinas.

<b>

By the way, Fenon-san was incredibly strong at Old Maid.

<b>

She was maneuvering in a way that allowed me to win, and whenever I had the Old Maid, she would quickly take it from me and pass it to Shiri-san. In the end, it turned into a situation where Shiri-san and Sera took turns losing. Does she have some kind of clairvoyance?

<b>

Shiri-san continued to lose and ended up in a half-crying state, while Sera was comparing herself to Shiri, saying, "I'm stronger than her." It seemed to have lifted her spirits a bit, which was good.

<b>

It's just between us, but I found Shiri-san's tearful expression to be cute.

<b>

We arrived in the city of Leinas just before sunset.

<b>

There was a moment when I wanted to comment on how the guard at the entrance bowed so low that it looked like he was doing a standing forward bend, but other than that, we were able to enter without any issues.

<b>

Fenon-san said, "There’s a good inn," and guided us through the city, so we followed her.

<b>

"Here it is."

<b>

Fenon-san said that and turned around, smiling at me.

<b>

Yeah. It definitely looks like a very nice inn. There must be a fluffy bed, and the rooms are probably unnecessarily spacious.

It seems to be located in the center of the city, and it’s likely the most luxurious and largest building in town.

<b>

<b>

Isn’t this the duke's residence?
