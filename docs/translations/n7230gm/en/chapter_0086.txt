# 83 The Crumbling World

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Just let me be alone for a bit."

<b>

After telling Sera, who looked sad with her brows furrowed, that, I locked myself in my room. The quiet sound of the door closing seemed to express our current feelings.

<b>

The bed, the room's light, the walls, the floor—nothing has changed.

I let out a sigh of relief in secret at the fact that things have "not changed." I collapsed onto the bed in a relaxed state, resting my cheek on the pillow and turning my face to the side.

<b>

There is no hunger, no sleepiness, no sadness. This world is already covered in darkness.

<b>

"Please wake me from this dream..."

<b>

The clear thought denied the words I spoke. This is not a dream—it's not.

<b>

Before entering the room, I named acquaintances one by one to Sera in the living room and asked her if she knew them. The result—so far, the only ones confirmed to have disappeared from this world are Phenon and Shiri.

The Thunderbolt's Trail, Regulus, Lyleus, Duke Margus—she knew all of them.

<b>

However,

<b>

"Even though the countries have disappeared, no one seems to notice..."

<b>

There were other things that had disappeared besides them.

That is, five countries excluding the Lindale Kingdom.

Before I knew it, it had become the case that only the Lindale Kingdom existed in this world. Moreover, it seems that the land itself has disappeared and turned into the sea, so the actual number of people who have vanished must be countless.

<b>

I learned this fact when I told Sera, "Phenon’s engagement with other countries has been annulled—" and she informed me that there were no other countries.

Because everyone is acting naturally, it has become difficult to discern what is abnormal and what is normal.

<b>

They just disappeared.

<b>

They didn't die from an incurable disease, nor were they killed by an assassin somewhere, nor were they kidnapped by a secret organization, nor did they go missing like in a divine abduction.

<b>

They disappeared. Their existence completely vanished.

<b>

Even though I might never see Phenon and the others again, I can't express my emotions well, and I can't even cry. Surely, my heart still cannot fully accept this mysterious phenomenon.

Isn't "dazed and confused" exactly what describes my current situation?

<b>

As I exhaled deeply, I recalled the situation when that mysterious ringing in my ears occurred.

<b>

And then I remembered something very important.

A child's voice.

<b>

"—That damn kid..."

<b>

I don't know if they are truly a "kid," but the voice's owner had said.

<b>

"Defeat Venom. Then everything will return to normal"—or so.

<b>

That kid surely knows about this world. After all, they mentioned the name Venom, which no one should know, clearly indicating something is not normal.

They knew that Phenon would disappear, that Shiri would disappear, that the countries would disappear. That's why I think they used the words "return to normal."

<b>

If that's the case.

<b>

"It means I need to defeat Venom."

<b>

Is that damn kid the one who made Phenon and the others disappear, threatening me? Or is it someone else who is destroying this world, and that child is giving me advice?

<b>

...I don't know.

<b>

"Either way, this situation is bad. Of course, I want to return Phenon and the others to normal as soon as possible, but Sera and the others might go crazy too."

<b>

I muttered with a sigh, as if trying to convince myself.

<b>

It seems that the memories of those who have disappeared (though I've only confirmed with Sera) have been forcibly altered, leaving parts missing from their memories and inconsistent histories lingering in their minds.

<b>

For example, the wooden necklace carved with the Yukarimusubi flower that I received from Phenon and Sera.

<b>

When I showed it to Sera, she said, "I carved it all," but she tilted her head while looking down at the part that Phenon had carved.

There might have been parts that she didn't remember or that were different from her own carving style. I quickly retrieved it, fearing that pursuing it would confuse Sera, but it eliminated the possibility that "only I had memories implanted."

<b>

Phenon and Shiri did not live in my delusional world; they undoubtedly existed in this world. Just knowing that is enough.

<b>

Then I should act to restore the correct world.

Even if the method is something as ridiculously difficult as defeating Venom—I've accomplished it once before, so it's not impossible.

<b>

"I'll clear the A-rank dungeon 50 times, then change to a third job before tackling the S-rank dungeon."

<b>

As quickly as possible. I will bring Phenon and the others back to this world. I will retrieve that smile.

<b>

It will be difficult for the residents of this world, who are unaware of what they have lost, to understand my feelings right now. Of course, Sera is the same.

That's why I must accomplish this alone. Above all, I can't take my important people into a fight that is too dangerous. I don't want to take them with me.

<b>

After all, I am a solo player, and I'm used to solitude. There is no problem.

<b>

Just as I turned off the room's light, Sera asked in a trembling voice from beyond the door, "Aren't you hungry?" If I'm not mistaken, she is worried about me.

However, since I wasn't hungry and had no desire to eat with anyone, I replied, "I'm going to sleep now," and I crawled into bed.

<b>

"…I'm sorry."

<b>

I curled up in bed, hugging my knees, apologizing to Sera, who had been considerate.

<b>

I believe that the mysterious phenomenon was triggered by the Thunderbolt's Trail clearing the A-rank dungeon. So, until I clear the S-rank dungeon, it shouldn't worsen any further.

<b>

Such a naive thought was easily shattered the next morning.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I'm going to stay in the A-rank dungeon for a while to change to a third job. Are you coming, Sera?"

<b>

The breakfast table felt a bit lonely with half the residents gone. I guess I'm the only one feeling this loneliness.

<b>

In response to my question, Sera started to speak with an apologetic expression, "Actually..."

<b>

"Last night, someone from the guild visited from the royal capital. It seems the guild master there wants to hear detailed information about Esuar. Surely, he understands that you are the one who knows the most about the current situation."

<b>

Last night means—did someone visit after I went to sleep? Upon closer inspection, Sera's face seemed to show a bit of fatigue. Perhaps she had been dealing with things in my place until late at night.

<b>

"Regulus, huh. I wish he would come here."

<b>

I cursed that bald man in my heart while expressing my dissatisfaction without hiding it.

Normally, Sera would respond with a wry smile, saying, "Don't make that face." But today was different.

<b>

She looked very sad, trembling as she wove her words.

<b>

"...I'm sorry. That name 'Regulus' is the first time I've heard it..."

<b>

What words can I use to express my feelings when I heard her words?

<b>

I had confirmed Regulus's name with Sera last night. Yet, she claims not to know that name.

<b>

"…Haha, hahaha..."

<b>

I could only laugh at this point.

<b>

It’s broken. This world has completely broken.

<b>

In other words, the collapse triggered by clearing the A-rank dungeon is still ongoing. Even Sera, who is right in front of me, could disappear at this very moment—such is the situation. I understood that.

<b>

I leaned my elbows on the table and buried my head in my hands. I gripped my head tightly, as if it might creak from the pressure.

Sera was saying something, but I couldn't comprehend what she was saying. Various pieces of information and emotions were swirling in my mind.

<b>

<b>

I don't understand. I don't want this. Why did this happen? Return Phenon and the others. Where has my daily life disappeared to—.

<b>

<b>

That day, I neither met the unknown guild master nor headed to the A-rank dungeon, but instead locked myself in my room.

<b>

And without any sleepiness, I crawled into bed, simply wishing to wake up from this dream.
