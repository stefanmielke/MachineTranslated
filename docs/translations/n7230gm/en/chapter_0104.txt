# 101 Preparation Complete

<b>

<b>

<b>

About a month after acquiring the White Lotus.

<b>

I successfully defeated 10,000 monsters within a period that was roughly as expected. I might have exceeded 30 days slightly, but in this world where there are no mornings, afternoons, or nights, I think it's acceptable to consider it a margin of error.

<b>

The performance of the White Lotus was undoubtedly the same as in the game.

<b>

I had heard about it from Noah, but I couldn't be sure until I fought myself. I was uncertain whether I could truly recreate the battle from that time.

<b>

However, after 30 days of combat, that anxiety completely vanished.

I can fight just like I did on the day I defeated Venom—no, I think I can fight even better. It's been several years since I left Earth—though I enjoyed my life in this world, I certainly didn't stagnate.

<b>

<b>

By the way.

<b>

I had gathered all the weapons, armor, and stats necessary for the battle against Venom. I also had enough high-level potions and elixirs in my inventory for recovery.

There were no issues with combat using the White Lotus, and I had completed the energy replenishment that Noah needed—meaning the only remaining mission was to defeat Venom, the root cause of it all.

<b>

I took my time to sleep as much as I wanted for the final touches and spent what would likely be my last tea time with Noah. I sipped coffee from my cup and placed it on the table.

<b>

"You said it was far above, but how far is it to Venom?"

<b>

According to Noah, the battlefield this time is not inside a dungeon. It's in the sky.

<b>

"If you keep climbing the spiral staircase for 24 hours, you should arrive."

<b>

"That's high."

<b>

To minimize the impact of the destruction god Venom on this planet, he is sealed away in a distant location. It seems I don't have to worry about thin air making it hard to move my body, but climbing a spiral staircase for 24 hours would definitely be a height that would make anyone nervous, even if they don't have acrophobia.

<b>

"Even if you happen to lose, as I said before, you won't completely die. Since half of your soul remains, you'll be able to resume your life on Earth."

<b>

"…I remember that. But why are you worrying about losing now—you're unusually weak-minded today."

<b>

"Haha—maybe Venom is breaking my emotions too."

<b>

Even though she is a creator god, it seems she can't make a smile very well.

She is probably trying to ease my tension, but with more than half of her face discolored, she is actually broken. Does she think I would laugh at that?

<b>

Since the atmosphere was getting a bit dark, I attempted to change the subject.

<b>

"What is the creator god of Earth like?"

<b>

I had heard a little about it from Noah before.

If I remember correctly—it was when I asked her, "Can't you borrow the power of another god?"

<b>

By the way, the answer to that question was "NO." Gods are basically non-interfering with other worlds, and the only exception recognized is the "soul exchange" that I have actually experienced.

The energy required for that soul transfer is paid by the receiving side. It's like Noah purchased my soul from the god of Earth.

<b>

"Hmm… I haven't talked about anything other than what's necessary, but… they firmly said, 'I respect the will of Rokudo Shuuichi.' If you had a personality that didn't want to spend time in this world, the soul transfer probably wouldn't have been permitted."

<b>

For now, it seems that the creator god is definitely kind.

<b>

"Also, if I were to translate it into your language, the ending would be something like 'no ja.'"

<b>

"That information was absolutely unnecessary."

<b>

If in human form, I think she would definitely have a loli figure. I actually hope so.

As if she read my mind, Noah laughed happily, "Ahahahaha."

<b>

"Once the battle with Venom is over, you'll meet her. Even if your soul decays in this world, it will return to Earth—and if you defeat Venom, the remaining soul will come here."

<b>

"That's… nerve-wracking."

<b>

"You don't seem to be nervous around me… even though I'm technically a creator god."

<b>

"You're just a brat. By the way, the fact that Noah uses the phrase 'we will meet' means there is some sort of hierarchy, right?"

<b>

Is the world of gods actually a strict vertical society?

<b>

"Of course there is. The longer a creator god has been around or the stronger they are, the higher their position. To explain the power relationship between me and the creator god of Earth in terms of status, there's a difference of about C rank to SS rank."

<b>

The no ja loli was incredibly strong. Well, it's not like it's been decided she's a loli, but still.

<b>

"I'm technically a mid-tier creator god, but the creator god of Earth has an overwhelmingly strong power. Naturally, I feel humbled."

<b>

"Wow…"

<b>

It's somehow pleasing to know that the god of the planet I was born on is amazing. I probably won't have much interaction with her, but if I actually meet her, should I bow down?

<b>

"Have you never thought about bowing down to me?"

<b>

………………Huh?

<b>

"Could you please not tilt your head in confusion from the bottom of your heart?!"

<b>

Noah protested while tapping the table with her small hands. She looked like a child throwing a tantrum.

<b>

While our first meeting was terrible and I haven't completely forgiven what Noah has done, I tend to be more positive about her methods.

<b>

To protect her world, she chose to sacrifice just one person.

<b>

I don't know if there was no other way, but if I were forced to make that choice, I think I would choose the same as Noah. I would sacrifice one heart from another world to protect countless lives in my own world.

It's a scale too large to imagine clearly, but it's not about right or wrong; it's just something that had to be done.

<b>

And the only victim created from that was—me.

To hit the odds far lower than winning the lottery's first prize—was I lucky or unlucky? It's hard to judge.

If I hadn't been caught up in the troubles of this world, I wouldn't have met Sera and the others in the first place.

<b>

Leaning my elbows on the table, I looked at Noah with a grin.

<b>

"You made me a sacrifice. Shouldn't you overlook my tone and attitude a bit? Come on—brat."

<b>

When I said that, Noah let out a big sigh and then muttered, as if she had given up, "I guess there's no helping it."

The way she said it made her look somewhat happy, but was that just my imagination?
