# 88 The Meaning of Being Summoned

<b>

<b>

<b>

I had a dream.

<b>

It was a dream of when my friends threw a surprise first anniversary celebration for me.

Even now, more than a month later, I can vividly recall that time, which was perhaps the peak of my life.

However, in the dream, there were no signs of Phenon, Shiri, or Laika, who should have been there, and it was a party with just the four of us.

<b>

I could see myself holding a glass and happily talking with Shin. Suzu and Sera were also engaged in conversation while eating. No one seemed to notice this strange scene, which felt eerie to me.

<b>

I shouted from above them.

"This is wrong."

"Don't act like you're having fun when the three who disappeared are still gone—when the world is falling apart."

<b>

However, they showed no reaction. My voice did not reach them.

Eventually, Suzu disappeared as if dissolving into the air. Next, Shin, and then Sera vanished, leaving me alone in the living room.

<b>

The one holding the glass, me, turned to look at me.

That figure, resembling me, laughed mockingly and, despite looking up at me, spoke with a condescending gaze.

<b>

"In the end, no one could be saved."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…What a terrible dream."

<b>

I opened my eyes with a snap while still lying on the bed, directing my gaze toward the window. Light was streaming into the room through the gap in the curtains.

<b>

"I must have cried myself to sleep… What am I doing at my age? Did the three bring me here?"

<b>

I sluggishly got out of bed and opened the curtains. Judging by the state of the sky, it seemed to be morning. Even though I had accumulated various fatigue, had I really slept for a whole day?

<b>

Outside the window, I could still see the dungeon and the soldiers.

It seemed like their numbers were gradually decreasing; was that a misunderstanding, or were they reducing personnel, or perhaps—had they disappeared?

<b>

"…This broken world should end soon."

<b>

I murmured while pressing my forehead against the window glass.

<b>

It's too painful to realize that my memories have been altered and that my friends have disappeared. Depending on how you look at it, it might be sadder than me, who recognizes that they vanished right before my eyes.

<b>

"I don't want to see Sera and the others like that anymore…"

<b>

The Sera I had interacted with since the A-rank dungeon was cleared, I could no longer tell if she was the same person I once knew.

I can't bear to see my friends, who have had their history distorted and their memories erased, with a calm face.

<b>

"That said, ending it with my own hands is also…"

<b>

I suspect that clearing the S-rank dungeon might lead to further collapse of the world.

At that time, Sera and the others who are still in this world would likely disappear as well.

In other words, clearing the S-rank dungeon is like pulling the trigger of a gun aimed at them.

<b>

It's not that I would actually kill someone, but still, hesitation arises.

<b>

As I let out a deep sigh, fogging up the window glass, I heard a familiar knock.

"I'll come in," I replied with a lack of enthusiasm, and Sera slowly opened the door and entered the room.

<b>

"I heard some noise, so I thought you might be awake. Have you recovered a bit from your fatigue?"

<b>

"Yeah, it seems I was more tired than I thought. You three brought me here, right? Thanks."

<b>

I hadn't even noticed that I was being carried. I must have been in a deep sleep.

<b>

"Don't worry about it. Shin and Suzu are relaxing in the living room, so after you wash your face, let's all have breakfast together. You haven't eaten all day, so you must be hungry, right? Should I make something gentle on the stomach?"

<b>

"No, I can eat normally—thank you."

<b>

"Alright, I'll be preparing breakfast, so wait a bit."

<b>

"Got it."

<b>

With that, the conversation ended, and Sera left the room.

Even though my memories have been altered, Sera's personality remained the same kind Sera as before.

If only she had become a completely different person, I could head toward the S-rank dungeon without hesitation.

<b>

"I should properly ask for their opinions too."

<b>

Is it better to be unaware, or is it better to know?

No, neither seems to be happy, but I think they would at least listen to my concerns. Besides, Sera continues to keep her promise with me. Therefore, I don't want to betray her. I shouldn't.

Since they have gathered here, I might as well talk to the three of them over a meal.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Alright! Then I'll deliver the finishing blow to the boss! Let's end this world with my own hands!"

<b>

"Don't say such ominous things… We're only disappearing until Esuar defeats that Venom or whatever, right?"

<b>

"Now that you mention it, that's true."

<b>

"Seriously… So, leave such an important role to me, a man."

<b>

"Be quiet, you sleepyhead. Are you still in a dream? When it comes to the boss of an S-rank dungeon, it's clear that they are a formidable enemy. What if you die before disappearing? I think it's more suitable for me, who can attack from a distance with magic."

<b>

This was the result of our discussion. Why are they competing for such an unpleasant role? Do they secretly harbor a desire for slaughter deep down? Or rather,

<b>

"No one doubts what I say. It's strange to say this after saying it myself, but I think it's a story that's hard to believe."

<b>

After washing my face, I went to the dining room for breakfast, where Sera, Shin, and Suzu were already seated, waiting for me.

While eating, I spoke as if I were confessing, sharing what had happened until now and what was to come.

If this memory alteration continues, someday you all might not be the you I know.

To solve this problem, it seems necessary to move forward—specifically, to clear the S-rank dungeon.

And as a result, you will likely disappear.

<b>

Despite the serious nature of the conversation, my friends' expressions were not dark. In fact, they looked bright.

<b>

"I promised to trust you!"

<b>

"I've been helped by you so much, so I'm relieved to finally have a chance to repay you."

<b>

"Thank you for consulting with us. We're comrades, so there's no need for you to shoulder this alone."

<b>

Even though I had cried so much last night, their warm words almost made me tear up again.

They are truly… truly kind comrades. I feel unworthy of them.

<b>

"Thank you, it helps to hear you say that."

<b>

"It's fine. In the end, it seems like the important parts will be left to you alone. That Venom guy, is he really strong?"

<b>

They didn't ask why I knew about Venom, just like when I spoke about my job's secrets. They probably understand that I won't answer.

<b>

"He's strong. It's not that he's unbeatable, but… honestly, I can't say for sure that we can definitely defeat him."

<b>

"If it's impossible for Esuar, then anyone who challenges him will lose, so if that happens, it's best to give up gracefully. We don't intend to ask for the impossible. When we became explorers, we were prepared to die."

<b>

"Of course, I don't think for a moment that you will lose."

<b>

"Exactly."

<b>

These guys… are they too positive? Even though they might disappear, they're being overly optimistic.

<b>

As I wondered about their attitudes, Shin opened his mouth and said, "By the way."

<b>

"You probably don't know because you're always holed up in dungeons, but because of the memory confusion, chaos is breaking out everywhere, and apparently, some people have suddenly started screaming. So I also think, like you said, that this world is broken. And it needs to be resolved quickly."

<b>

I see.

So that's why they are being unusually proactive.

<b>

"…You realize you’re entrusting your lives to me, right? Are you all okay with that?"

<b>

"Because it's you we're entrusting our lives to. Besides, just because we clear the S-rank dungeon doesn't mean we will definitely disappear, right?"

<b>

Saying that, Shin flashed a smile, showing his teeth.

Normally, I would be jealous and think, "This handsome guy!" but right now, that expression looks reassuring.

<b>

However, I feel bad for him encouraging me, but I can't believe that Shin and the others will remain.

<b>

Now I understand.

I was summoned to this world not to save Phenon, but to restore this world.

<b>

<b>

And I must defeat Venom alone.
