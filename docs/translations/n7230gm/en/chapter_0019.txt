# 18 The Competitive Man

<b>

<b>

"Honestly, if you're a three-person party at that level and still lingering around the third floor, even with one status bonus, it's going to be difficult to clear it. Even if Serah joins, the risk of casualties is quite high."

<b>

<b>

In response to my statement, as expected, Shin furrowed his brow.

<b>

"You're speaking from quite a high ground to the top explorer of this country."

<b>

He said, casting a light glare. Suzune and Laika didn't say anything, but their expressions showed discontent.

The one who countered was Serah.

<b>

"The fact is, he's strong."

<b>

She, sitting next to me, had an unusually serious expression. The only one who has fought alongside me in this world is Serah. She would know my strength the best. Still, it felt more like a playful sense.

<b>

"What? You're really backing SR, huh? Could it be that rumor was true? That you lost in a mock battle?"

<b>

There were plenty of spectators, so it's not surprising that he knows about the mock battle. Serah seems to be famous.

<b>

"Yeah, it's true. I lost to SR without being able to put up a fight."

<b>

With a slight puff of her chest, Serah replied.

No, Serah. Why are you saying that so proudly? That's not something to boast about.

<b>

"…You seem to have some skill, but considering the status bonus I just heard about, isn't there not much difference between your abilities and SR's? If that's the case, and you looked down on us—then this guy needs to experience a bit of pain."

<b>

With his arms crossed, Shin pointed at me with his chin.

<b>

As for me, hearing that made me only smile wryly. Because Shin is misunderstanding. I had no player bonuses at that time.

While I was thinking about how to correct his mistake, Serah spoke up first.

<b>

"Shin. I lost about ten days ago. SR now is different."

<b>

"—Hah. What can you do in just ten days?"

<b>

I think you can do quite a bit in ten days. Not that I would say it out loud.

<b>

"You might not believe it, but… he, SR, was in an unselected job state until the day before our mock battle. The mock battle happened when he was simply at level 5 of a low-tier job."

<b>

When Serah said that, his gaze turned to me with suspicion.

<b>

"Impossible. Are you sure you're not being deceived?"

<b>

"I'm not being deceived."

<b>

Shin and Serah glared at each other. What are you two fighting for? This isn't the time for that.

<b>

In fact, the conversation has strayed too far… I should correct the course around here.

<b>

"I'm sorry for the way I said it. But you understand that clearing it is difficult, right?"

<b>

After lightly bowing my head, I asked the Thunderbolt Trail. They seemed to think my point was valid, as they all fell silent.

<b>

Challenging a B-rank dungeon with their statuses is reckless to begin with. However, they compensate for that with skill and are attacking the dungeon. The title of the kingdom's number one isn't just for show.

If they continue to raise their statuses steadily, they might reach my level.

<b>

"So what do you want us to do? You say we can do it and then say we can't; it's confusing."

<b>

Suzune and Laika nodded at his statement.

They're right. I guess I was being a bit roundabout.

<b>

"It's about role division."

<b>

"…Role division?"

<b>

Shin repeated my words with a puzzled expression.

<b>

"Yes. I want Thunderbolt Trail and Serah to clear layers 1 to 5 of the B-rank dungeon. Even if clearing all of them is difficult, that should be possible."

<b>

"…What about the boss?"

<b>

"I'll handle it."

<b>

"By yourself?"

<b>

"Yes. I'm not good at party combat. It's easier for me to fight alone."

<b>

I could clear layers 1 to 5 and leave the boss to the fully prepared Thunderbolt Trail and Serah, but in that case, I would be in a useless state, and if something happened to them, I wouldn't be able to respond. That wouldn't be a very good gamble.

<b>

Shin was staring deeply into my eyes. Suzune and Laika were doing the same.

Eventually, Shin let out a deep sigh.

<b>

"…Fine, I'm tired of thinking."

<b>

Shin said that and scratched his head.

He often does this messy hair-scratching motion; it must be a habit of his.

<b>

"Let's assume everything SR said is true. You're stronger than any of us, and you can defeat the boss alone. But—there's no clear goal. You suddenly appeared, giving us valuable information, and you want to save the princess? That's not it, is it? There must be a more straightforward, self-serving reason."

<b>

With a different atmosphere than before, he questioned me.

If I answer incorrectly here, they won't cooperate. I felt that intuitively.

While I genuinely want to save the princess, if I say that, he won't be satisfied. I need to give another reason.

<b>

…Hmm.

<b>

How would they react if I answered my true feelings?

Should I just cover it up and string together some pretty words?

No, that's impossible. I'm not good at lying.

<b>

"—I hate losing."

<b>

"Eh? What did you say?"

<b>

Since it was something I didn't want to say, I ended up speaking in a small voice, and it seemed my words didn't reach Shin.

This time, I spoke clearly and raised my voice.

<b>

"So, I hate losing!"

<b>

Like Shin, I was also tired of thinking.

Whatever happens, happens. Throw away any sense of shame!

<b>

"You hate losing?"

<b>

"Yes, that's right. The idea of me losing in this world—it's ridiculous. It doesn't matter if it's against a person or a situation. Of course, I want to save the princess's life, but I can't forgive myself for not being able to save her. I shouldn't be able to give up over such a minor setback… No way. If I have to run away and live comfortably, I'd rather die. Especially if it's about clearing a B-rank dungeon? —Hah! That's impossible. Even if everything is taken from me, I have no intention of falling!"

<b>

As I finished speaking, the room fell silent.

<b>

…Phew. I felt relieved after saying what I wanted to say.

The last part got a bit heated and ended up sounding a bit broken, but it's too late for that. Besides, I feel like I said some unnecessary things, but let's just say it's my imagination.

<b>

Ignoring the five who didn't move at all, I downed the remaining tea in my cup in one go. I couldn't taste or smell anything.

<b>

The first to move was Suzune.

<b>

"—Puh."

<b>

She looked down, her body trembling slightly.

<b>

"I wanted you to say something like, 'I want to save the princess with all my heart,' even if it was a lie."

<b>

Serah said with a wry smile.

After that, she resolved it herself by saying, "Well, as long as I can save her, anything is fine," and reached for a cookie.

<b>

Regulus sighed deeply while resting his head on the table, and Laika looked at me with a smirk. Shin, like Suzune, was looking down, trembling.

<b>

"—Kukuku. What did I think you were going to say? Just a sore loser, huh?"

<b>

"That's what I said at the beginning. I hate losing."

<b>

"You did say that."

<b>

Saying that, he trembled again. It seemed he was trying to hold back laughter. If you look closely, Suzune also seemed to be laughing.

<b>

Having my heartfelt speech laughed at, I felt the uncomfortable air, and Shin said, wiping the corners of his eyes with his fingers, "I get it."

<b>

"We were stuck and at our wits' end anyway. We'll ride this muddy boat or whatever."

<b>

"You can think of it as a luxury cruise."

<b>

It's not the Titanic!

<b>

At my statement, Shin chuckled again.

Seriously… even his way of laughing is handsome. If I get the chance, I should try to imitate it.

<b>

"We're going to make Serah and the others our supporting characters. We can't afford to lose."

<b>

"Of course. Everyone, please enjoy watching my combat at your leisure."

<b>

Feeling relieved that everything had settled down, I smiled and told Shin that.

<b>

I've almost perfectly understood how to move my body with this status. While it's not as good as when I fought the Demon King Venom, I should be able to move close to that level.

<b>

I suppose I should show them what a fight from someone at the top looks like.

<b>

By the way, Regulus.

Even though he should be the one in the highest position, he's almost like air.

<b>
