# 86 The Former NEET Shouldering the Fate of the World

<b>

Chapter 4, starting now!!

This is the part where all the mysteries are revealed!

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

An A-rank dungeon near my house.

<b>

The drops from this jungle-type dungeon are armor and shields. For the people of this world, who didn't even know about the existence of S-rank dungeons, this would be quite powerful equipment, but for me, who specializes in evasion, they are nothing but items that hinder my movement. Honestly, I don't need them.

<b>

The equipment I wore when I defeated Venom in the world of Tempest was all drops from S-rank dungeons. Moreover, the drop rate is quite low, just like with rings.

<b>

"I wonder what will happen next..."

<b>

In this uncertain situation, my mind is gradually becoming exhausted.

I don't even know what the cause is, what the criteria are, or how it's breaking down. Since I can't confirm the answers, thinking about it is probably pointless.

<b>

Currently, I am trudging through the forest on the third layer of the A-rank dungeon, searching for the presence of monsters.

Finally on my 15th round.

I think it's been about six or seven days since I started traversing the A-rank dungeon.

<b>

Time outside doesn't matter in the dungeon; there are dungeons with constant blue skies and dungeons where stars twinkle forever. The A-rank dungeon I am currently diving into is always in twilight.

<b>

I will keep moving as long as my stamina lasts, and when I reach my limit, I will return to my empty house to sleep. Regarding the entrance time rules of the dungeon, I silenced the guards by showing them a dagger with the royal crest. Power is convenient.

<b>

I am getting more sleep now than when I was trying to obtain the elixir to save Phanon. However, my internal clock is going haywire, and I am in a pretty tough mental state.

<b>

"I wonder if Sera is still in this world..."

<b>

What about the Thunderbolt's Trail? What about Mr. Riles? What about the Duke?

<b>

I could find out immediately by checking with the guards around my house, but I'm too scared to do so.

Sera, who disappeared leaving a note saying she was going to meet the Thunderbolt's Trail, is she still safe? Every time I confirm that her shoes are not at the entrance of my house, I feel like I'm being crushed by anxiety.

<b>

But it's better not to know. It's much better not to know whether she disappeared than to understand that she did.

<b>

"I need to shut out information."

<b>

Just as I muttered that, I spotted a large black lizard ahead in my path.

Its body length is about four meters, I think? With a mouth that could easily swallow a human head and claws as thick as my arms, if attacked by those claws, I would be afflicted with paralysis poison that hinders my movement for several minutes. That said, if I don't get hit, there’s no problem at all. It's a monster so insignificant that I've forgotten its name and its drops are nothing special.

<b>

I readjust my grip on the red sword in my right hand and proceed without hesitation.

Noticing the sound of crunching leaves and twigs underfoot, the monster turned to face me.

At first, it approached sluggishly, but as it got closer, it gradually picked up speed and charged at me.

<b>

"Ha... If only I could concentrate on the battle, I wouldn't have to think about anything else."

<b>

I slashed at the monster's front leg while dodging it, activating the sage's skill "Body Enhancement" as I spun in place. Without losing momentum, I beheaded the large lizard. The monster vanished into particles without resistance.

<b>

Even though my profession is a magic-based sage, I was able to take down the enemy in one hit thanks to the "Strength Ring" I wore on my finger and the "Body Enhancement" skill. At the moment of attack, my STR increases by two stages.

The body enhancement skill that continuously absorbs magical power also consumes little magic when used only at necessary moments, making it the best cost-performance option.

<b>

I continue to trudge along, searching for monsters.

<b>

"Will I defeat Venom first, or will all of humanity besides me disappear first? Well, it's definitely the latter."

<b>

It will take at least four years to prepare my stats to solo defeat Venom, even at a conservative estimate. If the world continues to break down at this pace, there will be nothing left in this world.

<b>

"The question is, what will disappear and what will remain?"

<b>

Muttering to myself, I quickly take down the large lizard I encountered again in a matter of seconds.

<b>

"I, who am not affected by this anomaly, will probably remain. And likely, the dungeon will remain too."

<b>

Despite other countries disappearing, the S-rank dungeon that was supposed to appear there has emerged around my house. In other words, the dungeon will not disappear.

...In fact, if the dungeon were to disappear, I would lose my means of leveling up, and my hopes of defeating Venom would vanish entirely, so I can only believe that the dungeon will remain. There's no point in thinking about what would happen if the dungeon disappeared.

<b>

"A world where only the dungeon and I remain... sounds too terrible."

<b>

What kind of hell would that be? I'm not a machine for hunting monsters.

But if that were to happen...

<b>

"If defeating Venom would return the world to normal, then I have no choice but to do it."

<b>

Imagining a future where I endlessly defeat monsters alone, I let out a sigh.

If this world were to disappear along with me, then it would be what it would be. There's no way to resist it.

<b>

However, considering what that mysterious voice said, I probably have a chance to defeat Venom. Otherwise, they wouldn't have said, "Please defeat Venom."

To defeat the Overlord Venom, I need to have all the stat bonuses. In other words, I can think that I have some time until I acquire those stats.

<b>

"That said, I don't think I have the luxury of taking it easy."

<b>

Ultimately, the profession that will challenge Venom—the Demon King—will obviously need to be leveled up to 100, and the other classes, such as the Saints, Spirit Archers, and Sword Saints, will also need to be leveled up to 90 to obtain stat bonuses.

Additionally, the three professions required for the Demon King's job change—Heavy Knight, Sage, and Mage—can still use their skills even after changing jobs to Demon King, so they must be leveled up to 80 to acquire those skills.

The skills that can only be obtained at level 80 are all powerful.

<b>

But.

<b>

"The most important thing is my skill..."

<b>

Tempest has fewer professions and skills compared to other games.

That's why it was a game where significant differences arose from the player's technique.

<b>

In any case, if I turn on the system assist, it will support my sword swings and body movements, but all the top players of Tempest played in a completely manual way.

No matter how logical the system assist's movements are, to top players like me, they seemed to be saying, "Please counterattack" or "Please dodge" with their monotonous attacks.

It might be sufficient for monsters in an A-rank dungeon, but such half-hearted attacks won't work against S-rank dungeon bosses or other players.

<b>

Of course, not against Overlord Venom.

<b>

"Just regaining the self I had when playing Tempest isn't enough—I need to become stronger."

<b>

Back then, the premise was that "you can resurrect even if you die," which allowed for aggressive battles.

<b>

But now it's different.

<b>

My life is at stake, and if I lose to Venom, this world will surely "end" in the literal sense. No one will be resurrected, no one will be saved, and no one will remain.

<b>

"Hahaha... shouldering the fate of the world is really like being a hero. But I'm not; I'm just an ordinary NEET. This burden is too heavy, it's foolish. Wouldn't it have been better to call in a trained Self-Defense Force instead of me?"

<b>

Despite feeling self-destructive, I continue to take down each monster reliably.

Before I even think about how to defeat the monsters, my body instinctively slaughters them.

<b>

"Well—there's no point in wishing for what I don't have. Besides, no matter how trained a person is, in this world of swords and magic—especially with this 'eye' I have, it's not easy to find someone stronger than me."

<b>

I actually want to say, "Go ahead and find one." To whom? I don't know.

<b>

"If I defeat Venom, then Phanon and Sera—wait, no, that's not good. I should avoid setting up flags."

<b>

Muttering to myself, I continued deeper into the jungle.

Through the endless twilight.
