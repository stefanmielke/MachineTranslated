# 49 To the Royal Capital

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day before the martial arts tournament.

Today is a travel day with no dungeon exploration.

<b>

I had already said my goodbyes to those who took care of me, like Mr. Riles and the receptionist who acted as the referee during the mock battles, and all that remains is the duke's family. I am fully prepared for departure.

<b>

"Thank you for taking care of me for a month. I believe I will be coming back soon, but when I do, I plan to rent a different house, so please don't worry."

<b>

Lord Drag and Butler Lorenz came to see me off all the way to the entrance of the town.

Even though I said it was enough in front of the house, Lord Drag insisted, bowing his head and saying, "At least let me do this," so I had no choice.

Initially, he had said he would send me all the way to the royal capital, so we ended up making mutual concessions.

I parted ways with his wife and daughters in front of the house, and it would have been nice if Lord Drag and the others had matched that.

<b>

"I am the one who should be grateful. I truly apologize for the matter of the medicine—and thank you."

<b>

Despite the eyes of those around us, Lord Drag bowed his head.

Please stop, as the townspeople are murmuring.

<b>

"If Lord SR wishes, you are welcome to come anytime. We will welcome you."

<b>

He raised his face and extended his right hand to me.

Unlike a month ago, that hand is not a fake but a real one with warmth.

<b>

"Finally, we can truly shake hands."

<b>

"Thanks to you, Lord SR. I vow to never forget this debt for my lifetime."

<b>

The nobles I meet tend to be quite humble. They are all quick to bow their heads.

I want to question whether it's okay for those in power to be like that, but I feel like I have done enough to warrant it, so I will refrain from pursuing it further. The townspeople were also watching curiously from a distance, so it must not be something that happens often.

<b>

I grasped Lord Drag's warm hand and said to the two of them, "Let's meet again."

<b>

<b>

<b>

We left the town of Renus in the morning and, like on the way here, we were jostled in the carriage.

There were no events like being attacked by thieves or rescuing a beautiful girl from monsters. In this world, monsters do not spawn outside dungeons, after all.

<b>

The seating in the carriage is the same as on the way here, with Sera next to me and Fenon and Shiri sitting across from us. I feel like Sera is keeping a bit of distance from me, but I don't feel the need to point it out, so I decided not to worry about it.

Sera has a skillful ring on her left middle finger, and she occasionally caresses it lovingly.

<b>

"Once the martial arts tournament is over, I want Fenon and the others to shine as well. Let's start with some practice in a C-rank dungeon."

<b>

Initially, I had planned to operate in a C-rank dungeon for a while, but since Sera has shown unexpected growth, I decided to change my plans.

I have decided to make the main battlefield for this party a B-rank dungeon.

<b>

Once we are accustomed to combat in the C-rank dungeon of the royal capital, I plan to gather rings while leveling up in the B-rank dungeon of Renus.

<b>

"It's finally happening... I might hold you back at first, but please take care of me."

<b>

"I-I will do my best too!"

<b>

Fenon clenched her fist with determination, and Shiri nodded vigorously.

<b>

They have been quite idle lately, so it's only natural that they are filled with motivation.

<b>

Although they haven't directly defeated monsters, their statuses have been steadily increasing as planned. Of course, both Sera and I have also become stronger.

<b>

Fenon is a heavy knight and a barrier mage.

Sera is a martial swordsman and a divine archer.

And I have raised the levels of my mighty and heavy knight classes to 30 each, earning two player bonuses.

<b>

Unlike us, Shiri started leveling her primary class, so her pace is a bit slower compared to the others. While she has raised her magic archer to level 30, her next class, the mage, has not yet reached level 30.

Eventually, this discrepancy should become negligible, so there's no need to worry about it for now.

<b>

"For now, let's finish the martial arts tournament first—I'm counting on you, Sera."

<b>

At my words, she responded with a wry smile.

<b>

"I have become stronger—I can feel it myself, but Ray brother... I have never won against you even once. To be honest, I am quite anxious."

<b>

"Don't worry. Sera, you have become strong enough."

<b>

I feel like she may have become a bit too strong.

<b>

"…Yes, that's true. I can't let my master's face be sullied, so I will aim for victory with all my might."

<b>

"…It's good to have motivation, but take it easy, okay? I think you're stronger than Shin right now, so keep that in mind when you fight, alright? If you're not careful, you might seriously injure your brother."

<b>

When I said that, Sera looked wide-eyed and stared at me.

<b>

"…Me, stronger than Shin?"

<b>

"From what I've seen, I'd say there's an 80% chance you'll win. Shin has also become strong in terms of stats, but you've significantly improved in skill as well. Honestly, it's abnormal."

<b>

"Haha, I don't want to hear that from my master."

<b>

"Hey, my abilities are the result of hard work."

<b>

I just got really into the game, but I’ll keep that to myself.

The effort I put in is a fact—I'm not lying.

<b>

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," Sera said with a laugh, and Fenon joined the conversation.

<b>

"Really, Sera has become strong. There’s no one stronger than you in the knight brigade. I've seen the training scenes many times, so you can be confident."

<b>

"Thank you, Fenon."

<b>

"Well, you still can't compare to Lord SR."

<b>

"If you're going to praise me, do it all the way to the end..."

<b>

Sera shrugged her shoulders in a way that said, "What a hassle." I also didn't know how to react, so I let out a dry laugh of "hahaha."

<b>

<b>

After that, we took about the same amount of time as on the way here, and we returned to the royal capital after about a month. Just like when we arrived in Renus, it was around the time the sky began to darken.

Even though we had only been apart for a month, it felt quite nostalgic.

<b>

The slightly changed distance with Sera, and the significant change in her strength.

<b>

The people of this country, of course, and the Thunderbolt Brigade will surely be surprised to see Sera's match. Even though she is a temporary master, I feel proud.

<b>

<b>

Now, the martial arts tournament is about to begin.
