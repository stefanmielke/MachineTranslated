# 77 Surprise

<b>

<b>

<b>

Shin's homosexuality suspicion was cleared up, and we both felt relieved as we headed to the living room. We were able to have a successful love consultation, and I'm really glad. Really... I'm glad Shin is straight.

As I walked down the hallway, I was suddenly grabbed by the shoulder by Shin. My body jumped in surprise after our earlier conversation.

<b>

"Don't be so jumpy... it hurts, you know..."

<b>

Shin said with a tearful expression.

Maybe it's because his original face is handsome, but there's something oddly sadistic about it. I don't have that kind of hobby, though.

<b>

"Sorry, sorry. So, what's up now?"

<b>

I still didn't understand the reason for being forced to kill time in the bathroom.

I assumed he must have been told something by the girls, but asking him would be pointless if he was sworn to secrecy by Suzu or Laika. Even though he's the leader, Shin is under their thumb.

<b>

"Just wait here for a moment."

<b>

With that, Shin walked around the corner toward the living room.

From the direction he went, I could faintly hear the voices of the girls. However, I couldn't make out what they were saying, and since it was around the corner, I couldn't see what was happening in the living room.

<b>

After waiting for a few minutes in a daze.

<b>

"I'm bored..."

<b>

With nothing to do, I started stretching, checking my inventory, and staring at my status screen. Then, I noticed an unfamiliar string of text in the familiar window.

<b>

"When did this happen...?"

<b>

The age displayed in the status.

It had always been listed as "18," but when I checked now, it had changed to "19."

Considering that about a year has passed since I came to this world, it seems my birthday is set to the day I was summoned here. I can't say for sure, though.

<b>

It would be nice if my status increased along with my age... but even if I got older, there wouldn't be any benefits—thinking about that, Shin appeared around the corner with an apologetic expression.

<b>

"Sorry to keep you waiting."

<b>

"Seriously. Why do I, the homeowner, have to be given a waiting order?"

<b>

"Well, well. Don't be so uptight."

<b>

Shin said with a wry smile, trying to calm me down.

I'm not really angry, though. I just felt a bit stressed from not understanding the current situation and wanted to grumble a little.

As Shin nudged me from behind, I headed toward the living room.

Were they doing something that would make me angry if I saw it? They don't need to hide it so much; my boiling point isn't that low. I felt a little down about being left out.

<b>

But—

<b>

<b>

"—What the—"

<b>

Seeing the scene that unfolded in the living room, my mind went blank. With my mouth agape, I looked around the place that used to be the living room, unable to utter a word.

<b>

Where did they get all this from, and when did they prepare it—where the sofa and coffee table used to be was a large round table that looked like it was made of marble, and on it were drinks that seemed to be champagne and a variety of luxurious dishes.

The walls were even decorated with colorful ornaments. When did this place turn into a party venue?

<b>

"Hehe, are you surprised?"

<b>

With a smug grin, Sera asked.

<b>

"I am surprised... but what is going on...?"

<b>

I couldn't make sense of it.

If the Thunderbolt team had come to our house to throw a party, I could understand that. But if that's the case, there would be no reason not to inform me.

What exactly is this celebration for?

<b>

"Today marks exactly one year since SR-san came to this world. Did you know?"

<b>

At Fenon's question, I shook my head vigorously.

I had a rough idea, but I didn't know the exact date. Even though my status has a time display, it doesn't show the date.

<b>

"We were planning to give you a souvenir for the one-year anniversary, but since Sera and the others planned a party, we just went along with it."

<b>

"Since it's something ordinary for you, don't get your hopes up too much, okay?"

<b>

Suzu and Laika said while holding champagne glasses. By the way, the drink in Suzu's glass is a different color, probably because it doesn't contain alcohol.

<b>

"I feel kind of... bad. I haven't prepared anything..."

<b>

"You don't need to worry about that since you're the guest of honor today. Here, have a glass."

<b>

Saying that, Shin pushed a glass of champagne into my hands.

As I accepted the glass, everyone's gaze turned toward me.

<b>

"So, this is a party to celebrate my one-year anniversary in this world...?"

<b>

In response to my question, the six of them nodded and showed their agreement.

<b>

When did they come up with such a plan? I had no idea.

The planner must be either Fenon or Sera, but they really went to such lengths to prepare this for just me. I've never had a surprise like this back on Earth.

Experiencing it firsthand, I realized that happiness and embarrassment can coexist... a new discovery.

<b>

"Thank you, I'm really happy."

<b>

That was my genuine feeling.

Since I felt like I might tear up if I let my guard down, I decided to start the party quickly. No one seemed inclined to give a toast, so I might as well do it.

As I walked to the marble-like table, the other six naturally gathered around it.

<b>

"Thank you for going this far for me today. It seems like a year has passed since I came to this world, but it feels like it went by really quickly. I’ve conquered B-rank dungeons, revealed my secondary job—there's even been a martial arts tournament, and every day has been truly enjoyable. I believe that's all thanks to you being here with me."

<b>

Even if I could have done things on my own, my days wouldn't have been as fun as they have been.

<b>

"The level-up of the entire world is progressing smoothly—but we will continue to be at the forefront. Even if those around us level up, we will never let them catch up."

<b>

In response to my words, Shin said, "Of course."

The others also had motivated expressions. Only Shiri looked like, "Huh? Really?" but I decided to ignore it. It must be tough for a maid to follow her mischievous master.

<b>

"Though it will be tough days ahead, it should definitely get even more fun. So, I would be happy if you continue to be with me from now on—so, cheers!"

<b>

I raised my glass diagonally upward.

At that signal, the sound of our seven glasses clinking together echoed in the living room.

<b>

<b>

"「「「「「「Cheers！」」」」」」
