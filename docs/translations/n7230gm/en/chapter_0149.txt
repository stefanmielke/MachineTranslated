# Idle Talk: Kendama

<b>

It's idle talk!

Chronologically, this is around the time when SR is leveling up before defeating the boss of the S-rank dungeon.

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

The time is when the sun-like star is positioned directly overhead.

Sera and I were strolling through the bustling streets of the royal capital while shopping for daily necessities.

<b>

“—Ah, hello. I’ll do my best.”

<b>

“Leave it to me.”

<b>

As we were greeted with “Good luck in the dungeon” by a passing lady and what appeared to be her grandson, Sera and I responded with smiles. Since we couldn't stop every time, we just waved lightly while walking, but the boy looked pleased, so that was good enough. The lady seemed to want to say “Thank you” as she bowed her head.

To think that just waving would earn us gratitude… Truly, top explorers in this world hold a position similar to idols or athletes. Maybe I should start practicing my autograph soon— I thought.

<b>

“It’s true that if we’re not in disguise, we get approached.”

<b>

Sera whispered to me as she got a little closer, our arms almost brushing against each other.

To avoid revealing my fluster, I responded calmly.

<b>

“Well, yeah. But if we keep disguising ourselves, it’ll feel cramped, right? We can gradually get used to it. We’re party members, so it’s not strange for us to be together.”

<b>

“Hehe, that’s true—oh, can we stop by that general store over there? I heard they have new products.”

<b>

“Really? Then let’s go—hey, you don’t have to pull my hand.”

<b>

It seemed my opinion didn’t reach her, as Sera, with her eyes sparkling like a child’s, pulled my hand and led the way.

I guess this slightly forceful side of hers is also one of her charms.

<b>

<b>

<b>

As we entered the general store, which was about twice the size of a convenience store, there was a slightly plump, cheerful-looking male clerk and one customer each of male and female.

<b>

“—Ah.”

<b>

The female customer, upon seeing us enter, involuntarily let out a voice.

Noticing her presence, I decided to greet her.

<b>

“You were in the royal capital. You should have come by our place.”

<b>

“I was planning to go tomorrow. We just arrived in the royal capital last night, and I thought it would be rude to drop by suddenly… I sent a messenger to SR’s house about an hour ago.”

<b>

While fiddling with a wooden doll, Jill Vinzett, who hails from the Rezel Kingdom and is a participant in the international martial arts tournament, spoke.

The doll Jill was holding had such a creepy expression that I couldn’t help but chuckle, and from beside me, I heard a voice say, “That’s cute…”

I-I see… Is that thing cute? I don’t get it.

<b>

“Oh! If it isn’t the Sword Princess and SR! This toy from the Lindell Kingdom is amazing! It might be useful for training!”

<b>

With a laugh, Arnold Vinzett approached us. It seems he and his sister had come to this store together. I have no idea how he plans to use that for training, though.

<b>

“It’s been a while, Arnold… but I don’t think that’s useful for training.”

<b>

What he was holding was a kendama.

Back when I was on Earth, there were indeed ranks and people who had mastered it. But if asked whether Arnold could apply it to his swordsmanship, I couldn't help but tilt my head. Well, it is indeed a “ken,” though.

<b>

“Is that so? If I do this—”

<b>

Saying that, he suddenly crouched down and dangled the red ball attached to a string in the air.

As he took a few deep breaths to steady himself, I heard Sera swallow hard next to me. The store was so quiet that even that faint sound could be heard.

Jill looked on with an exasperated expression, while Sera gazed at him with anticipation. I was worried he might break the merchandise. I figured the store owner was probably feeling the same way.

<b>

“—Ha!”

<b>

Then Arnold, with a shout, vigorously pulled the ball upward.

<b>

With a grunt, Arnold dodged the ball that came flying toward his face.

There was a sound of the string snapping.

A crack echoed as the wooden board of the ceiling bent.

A scream from the store owner.

And finally, the sound of the ball striking the tip of the kendama.

<b>

In a pose reminiscent of stabbing a rapier into an enemy's throat, Arnold froze. From that angle, he might look somewhat cool. Though he was holding a kendama.

By the way, the tip of the kendama was not stuck in the hole. Instead, a new hole had been created somewhere completely different. And there was smoke coming out.

<b>

“Like this, you can train your reflexes—and precision! Hahaha! I might have gotten a bit too carried away!”

<b>

And again, he laughed heartily.

Everyone else in the store, except for him, was momentarily dumbfounded. Some might say we were drained by the sheer absurdity.

<b>

“Hey Jill, you’re the guardian here.”

<b>

“...I know, I know without being told! This idiot brother of mine!”

<b>

“—It hurts! Jill-neechan!?”

<b>

Ignoring Arnold's protests, Jill threw him outside and kicked him hard. The disparity between her appearance and her actual physical ability was astounding.

If this were Earth, it might just look like a typical sibling fight, but Arnold, kicked by Jill, was sent flying over ten meters… It was seriously like he was hit by a car. Well, he trains himself, so he might not have taken too much damage. Namu.

<b>

In the end, Arnold paid for the kendama, the store’s repair costs, and a nuisance fee, and since we couldn’t be unrelated to the situation, we also bought a few items from the general store before heading home.

<b>

It turned out to be a hectic day, but on the way back, Sera was happily holding the creepy doll, so I guess that’s good.
