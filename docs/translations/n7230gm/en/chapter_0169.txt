# A-53 Nīzu-kun

<b>

<b>

Sera, who had brutally destroyed the bamboo copter, was forcefully making the parent and child insist, "No payment is necessary!" with a flustered expression. It seemed like they wouldn't have accepted the money unless it was forced upon them... those two. I would probably have done the same if I were in Sera's position.

<b>

It was quite an interesting little shop, and I actually wanted to stay a bit longer, but we couldn't be late for our appointment with the prince, so we left the store. After we conquered the B-rank dungeon, we would have plenty of time anyway, and if we really wanted to go back, we could always do so. Besides, I was supposed to meet Neska-san again tomorrow, so we could talk about various things then. To be honest, today, the other party seemed too nervous for any meaningful conversation to happen.

<b>

After leaving the shop, we headed straight to the meeting place at the North Gate.

It seemed like we would arrive about 15 minutes early. Since it was with the prince, I wondered if we should have gone even earlier—such thoughts crossed my mind for a moment, but upon further reflection, Pheno was technically the First Princess as well. She sometimes acted like a tomboy, so the impression of her being a princess had faded a bit in my mind.

<b>

<b>

<b>

We were able to meet up with the prince at the North Gate without any issues.

<b>

I thought we had arrived early, but it seemed they had gotten there first. "We cannot keep you waiting," he said, speaking with his usual humility.

This refreshing handsome guy must be quite popular. He had come properly equipped, and while the royal demeanor inevitably radiated from him, his outfit was that of an explorer. It looked like it was a unique piece rather than a drop item.

<b>

There were a total of four carriages heading to the B-rank dungeon.

Ours, the one Nīzu-kun was in, and two carriages for the guards.

This time, the three of us exploring the dungeon with Nīzu-kun were me, Pheno, and Shiri.

Since it was the very first time, I thought it would be fine to have royalty accompany royalty, which led to this choice of members. If we were to add one more person from our side, either Noah or Sera would be left out, so it was decided that one of Nīzu-kun's guards would accompany us. He might feel uneasy without any family members around, so this should work out well.

<b>

"Is this your first time at a B-rank dungeon, Nīzu-sama?"

<b>

"Yes. I truly apologize for the trouble caused to everyone at ASR."

<b>

Saying this, Nīzu-kun lightly bowed his head to us from across the carriage.

Currently, I was in the carriage that Nīzu-kun had arrived in, also serving as a preliminary meeting. Pheno was on my left, and Shiri was on my right, while Sera and the others were in our carriage heading for the same dungeon. It was a spacious carriage, but it was still a bit cramped for six people.

As a result, Noah puffed her cheeks in dissatisfaction, and Sera wore a slightly sulky expression, but in the end, they didn't voice any complaints. It seemed they decided to dive into the B-rank dungeon together and aimed to clear it before us.

In terms of ability, we were probably at an advantage, but explaining various things to the prince would likely take about the same amount of time.

<b>

"No, no. I was planning to visit the dungeon as a sightseeing trip anyway, so you don't need to worry about it. So, what will you do, Nīzu-sama? Will you try fighting? If you do, I can support you."

<b>

"Hahaha— I have almost no combat experience, so while I appreciate the offer, I must decline this time. The purpose of this visit is to record and report on the S-rank dungeon, after all."

<b>

Well, that's true. Today is more like preparation for the main objective.

<b>

"Then is it alright if we wrap things up quickly?"

<b>

"That is perfectly fine. I might have a few questions, but I would appreciate answers within your capacity."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

When I replied like that, Nīzu-kun looked relieved and said, "Thank you." After a brief pause in the conversation, he turned to Pheno with a somewhat lighter demeanor.

<b>

"Compared to me, Pheno-sama is amazing. While holding the title of First Princess, you are part of the world's top-tier party."

<b>

Nīzu-kun said this with a genuine air of respect.

In response, Pheno calmly puffed out her chest and answered.

<b>

"It's all thanks to Esuāru-san. My combat experience is still lacking compared to the other members, but I don't feel inferior compared to regular explorers. Of course, it's a different story when it comes to participants of martial arts tournaments."

<b>

"If it comes to a simple test of strength, Pheno would probably win."

<b>

As I overheard the conversation between the royals, I muttered to myself, and Pheno quickly turned her head to look at me. For some reason, her cheeks seemed a bit flushed.

<b>

"W-Wait, Esuāru-san!? The way you said that makes it sound like I'm strong!"

<b>

"Ahaha, sorry, sorry. But it's okay; to me, you're a delicate maiden..."

<b>

"That's only from your perspective, Esuāru-san, isn't it!?"

<b>

"………………"

<b>

"If you're going to back me up, then do it all the way!"

<b>

Pheno, who was unusually flustered, was someone I hadn't teased much before, but her retorts were quite something. It warmed my heart to see her getting used to us. I wasn't sure if it was a good change, but I felt like it would upset the king if he found out.

<b>

Shiri watched our exchange with amusement, while Nīzu-kun looked on with a smile.

<b>

"If it's alright, could you speak to me in a more relaxed manner as well? Since we are together like this... I think it wouldn't be a problem given our positions. More than anything, it seems fun."

<b>

"Ah— well, I'm fine with that, but then Nīzu-sama, you should also relax your tone, okay? It would be a bit strange if it was just us speaking casually."

<b>

"Okay. Is this good enough? Esuāru-kun?"

<b>

This refreshing handsome guy is quick to respond! That was an immediate answer!? Shouldn't he hesitate a bit? Is this the power of royalty—no, maybe not.

<b>

"…Yeah, that's fine. Nīzu-kun."

<b>

Well, whatever.

Now I can call him "Nīzu-kun" without reservation.
