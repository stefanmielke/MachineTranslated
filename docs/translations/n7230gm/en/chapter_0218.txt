# A-101 Training in Evasion (No Evasion)

<b>

<b>

<b>

I was tasked with instructing the explorers of Rezel at the Explorer Guild.

The twelve individuals gathered on my side, including Ms. Soubi, seemed to have mixed feelings towards me, their attitudes or rather their atmosphere divided into several emotions.

<b>

One-tenth appeared very tense.

Another tenth looked somewhat annoyed.

And the remaining eighty percent displayed feelings of doubt.

<b>

Since I had Serah fight earlier, they might be questioning whether my guidance would truly be helpful. Well, what I'm planning to teach this time is evasion, so how useful it will be likely depends on each person's combat style, and I certainly can't say, "This will be an incredibly meaningful lecture!"

Moreover, I’m not particularly good at teaching others.

<b>

"So, I think we should do some training in evasion—though, teaching each of you how to move your bodies is difficult, so it will be more of a training in anticipating movements."

<b>

When I said this in front of everyone, they all tilted their heads in unison.

Then, a female explorer, the only one among them, timidly raised her hand.

She was one of the ten percent who were 'nervous explorers.'

<b>

"What is it?"

<b>

"Um, does predicting enemy movements mean... memorizing the behavior patterns of monsters?"

<b>

Memorizing the behavior patterns of monsters... huh. It's important to remember the big moves used by bosses, but... hmm.

<b>

"What rank dungeon are you currently diving into?"

<b>

"Mainly B-rank. Once I level up a bit more, I plan to challenge A-rank."

<b>

It seems she is among the higher ranks of explorers.

Her earlier statement makes sense given that context.

<b>

"Up to B-rank—no, if you push yourself, you can memorize the basic patterns of A-rank too, but beyond that, memorization won't suffice, and bosses will become quite tough. What I'm mainly going to convey is to observe the enemy's movements and predict them—something like that."

<b>

It's more suited for human combat than against monsters, I added.

As I displayed a wry smile to the explorers who looked as if they understood yet didn't, Ms. Soubi raised her voice.

<b>

"Well, I heard that this 'Overlord' supposedly cleared Lindell's S-rank dungeon solo. So, it makes sense that he would win against monsters."

<b>

Upon hearing Ms. Soubi's words, the explorers began to murmur.

Was that rumor true? Is it just a bluff? Surely, it can't be that easy, I heard various comments.

Since I’m not the one going around saying, "I cleared the S-rank solo!" and this is my first time stepping into Rezel, this reaction is understandable.

<b>

"Well, that's true, but whether you believe it or not is up to you. I'm just here today because Lady Katariya asked me to..."

<b>

I said this thinking that if there were too many opposing opinions, I might just leave, but Ms. Soubi laughed and said, "I've heard about your strength from Jill and Arnold, so don’t worry."

If she had teamed up with the Vinzett siblings for the martial arts tournament, then there must be some connection there.

<b>

"Then, avoid my arrow. First, I need to see a demonstration—surely you won't say you can't avoid an arrow, right?"

<b>

"Well, of course."

<b>

Not just me, but the rankers of Tempest should be able to handle it with ease. We were dodging the 'Binding Arrow' of the Spirit Archer, one of the third jobs—nearly a hundred arrows with tracking capabilities.

In a situation where there’s no blocked escape route, there's no way one couldn't avoid a single arrow.

Ms. Soubi stood up, took a bow from her inventory, and distanced herself from me—wait, how far does she plan to go?

<b>

"Ms. Soubi? You don't need to move that far away; if it's just avoiding one arrow, being close is fine, right?"

<b>

"Oh, sorry, sorry, it’s not that I underestimated you; I just didn’t know the range—since it’s a special occasion, let me know the closest distance you can avoid. That way, these guys will believe it too."

<b>

As Ms. Soubi scratched her head and said this, she walked over to me and stopped. The explorers were buzzing, but—this change was just from twenty-five meters to twenty meters, right?

As expected, there seems to be a significant difference in perception between me and them.

If Crescent or Jade were here, I could have demonstrated right there.

<b>

"…I'm sorry, Ms. Soubi. I can probably avoid it from any distance, so feel free to shoot from wherever you like. I can't manage zero distance, but as long as there's at least a fist's width of space, I think I can avoid it."

<b>

As I said this, I felt annoyed at how condescending it sounded. But since I can actually avoid it, it can't be helped! It feels bad to be humble and say, "Oh, that distance is just right~" when it's a lie.

After hearing my words, Ms. Soubi looked puzzled for a moment, then broke into a grin. Amidst the murmurs of the explorers, she approached within about five meters.

<b>

"Can you really avoid it from here?"

<b>

"I'm fine."

<b>

When I replied, Ms. Soubi drew her bow towards me. It seemed she was aiming for my throat. Perhaps because she was blunting the arrowhead, she was targeting a merciless point. I stood still, waiting for the attack.

While keeping an overall view, I didn’t neglect the details.

The movement of her eyes, her fingers, the muscles in her cheeks—countless experiences became intuition, and I couldn't possibly miss the timing of when she would release the arrow in this focused situation.

Then, just over ten seconds after Ms. Soubi drew her bow—an arrow was shot towards my throat.

<b>

"—!?"

<b>

"—Ah, I-I'm sorry!"

<b>

At the last moment, I remembered that the guild receptionist was behind me. I hadn't accurately grasped where she was, so I thought that if I dodged, I might hit her—such thoughts raced through my mind in an instant, and I reflexively grabbed the arrow instead of dodging it.

When I turned around, the receptionist was in a position outside the line of fire. It seemed I had been overly cautious. Of course, Ms. Soubi would be concerned about that too.

<b>

"I wasn't paying attention to what was behind me... I'm sorry, even though this is evasion training, I ended up grabbing it. Can we try again?"

<b>

Ms. Soubi stared at the arrow I had caught with a blank expression, and there was no response to my question.
