# A-34 Goal Achievement

<b>

<b>

<b>

Fifth layer of the S-rank dungeon.

Just as I finished defeating all the enemies in this layer, my Sword Saint's level finally reached 100. If my companions were with me, we might have celebrated together, but since I was currently exploring alone, I savored the sense of achievement by myself.

In the quiet, snowy stage, I displayed my status.

<b>

<b>

☆Status☆

<b>

Name: SR

Age: 20

Occupation: Sword Saint

Level: 100

STR: SS

VIT: SSS

AGI: SS

DEX: S

INT: SS

MND: SSS

Skills: Presence Detection, Double Slash, Anticipation, Intimidation, Sky Sword, Adversity, Swift Feet, Defense Penetration, Phantom Sword, Destruction Sword, Peak of Martial Arts

<b>

<b>

In the skills section, the long-awaited and nostalgic "Peak of Martial Arts" is displayed.

As for the increase in status, I no longer care. Once I become a Overlord, all will be SS anyway, and the stats I want can be adjusted with rings and equipment as much as I like.

<b>

"It feels a bit excessive, but if there's a higher goal, I have to aim for it. After all, I'm a boy."

<b>

My mental age is completely that of an old man, and I'm already 20 years old... but I'm still a boy!

Sigh... I wonder who I'm making excuses to...

<b>

The effect of the Peak of Martial Arts is a 20% increase in AGI and DEX. Additionally, the stiffening time caused by martial skills like Sky Sword is halved. For Sky Sword and Destruction Sword, the stiffening time of 0.8 seconds becomes 0.4 seconds.

<b>

Well, that's fine and all――

<b>

"Finally, the breakthrough is here."

<b>

I've already told the members of Thunderbolt's trajectory and my party that I would conquer the dungeon as soon as I reached level 100, and yesterday, I also informed Dino through Fenon that "SR will conquer the S-rank dungeon alone."

As a result, since yesterday, members of the knight order have been stationed in front of the dungeon. For the knight order and Dino, it might be hard to believe, but they can't ignore the words of Fenon, the first princess――that's probably the case.

I need to surprise them greatly and have them be witnesses.

Stretching as I exit the dungeon, I find Serah and the ASR members, along with three knights clad in armor. The sky is beautifully dyed in a deep crimson, as if urging me to return home.

Though we acted separately, Serah and the others were also delving into the S-rank dungeon today. It seems they were chatting with the knights while waiting for me.

<b>

"Welcome back!"

<b>

Although there's still some distance, Noah notices me and waves. This guy is as energetic as ever.

Following that, Serah, Fenon, and Shiri each greeted me with "Good work" and "How was it?" The knights give me a slight bow.

<b>

I raised my right hand in response, and as I got closer, I spoke up.

<b>

"Thanks for waiting. I've achieved my goal, so――to the knights, here you go. Please confirm."

<b>

I took out my license card from my inventory and presented it for everyone to see.

The person who is probably the highest in rank among the three wore a suspicious expression and said, "Let me see," bringing the card close to his face.

<b>

And then――

<b>

"……H-Hey, Port. Quickly――quickly contact Lord Dino! SR of ASR has conquered the S-rank dungeon alone! This is incredible!"

<b>

With wide eyes, he gave instructions without taking his gaze off the card.

The person called Port responded loudly and hurriedly took out a communication magic tool. The fact that he dropped the magic tool on the ground once shows just how flustered he is.

<b>

"Oh! Finally, huh! We also showed the card before SR returned. There shouldn't be any suspicion that 'actually, we went in together.'"

<b>

Hehe―― Serah said with a slightly proud puffed-up chest.

<b>

"Well, it was my idea, though."

<b>

"You didn't have to say that..."

<b>

No need to compete for credit like that. I'm grateful to both of you, regardless.

As I shrugged at their exchange, Fenon smoothly took my right arm. She hugged me tightly, pressing my arm against her chest.

<b>

Yes, my IQ just dropped to 3. I can't think at all.

<b>

"You must be tired, SR. For now, let's head home――you all, we are returning to the royal capital. If you have business with SR, please do it after tomorrow."

<b>

With a brisk tone that left no room for argument, Fenon spoke, and the knights straightened their posture, saying, "Yes!"

<b>

"Thanks, Fenon――ah, knights, could you also search for any new dungeons that might have appeared?"

<b>

"Understood! I will inform the higher-ups!"

<b>

Alright. I thought it might be a long shot, but I got a smooth okay.

I don't think Venom will appear again, but just in case.

<b>

"Will new dungeons really appear?"

<b>

Shiri murmured to herself while watching the bustling knights.

<b>

"I wonder. Well, I have an overpowered job now, so I'm not worried."

<b>

Even if they do appear, I don't think it will be a problem for me, having obtained the Overlord job.

Moreover, if a new dungeon were to appear, it should be purely for entertainment. In that case, there shouldn't be any overly strong enemies.

<b>

After all, the sealing of Venom and the subjugation of the Destruction God are no longer necessary in this world.

If a new dungeon were to be created, it would only be for the purpose of guiding this world in a better direction by the loli goddess.

<b>

<b>

Yes.

<b>

<b>

At that time, I was still thinking such carefree thoughts.

<b>

Little did I know that the loli goddess――Lady Idea had prepared a party far stronger than Venom for me to fight against.
