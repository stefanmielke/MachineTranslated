# A-43 Conclusion and Speech

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I was still inside the VR game Tempest, which exists on Earth—meaning, before I reincarnated into this world. What was I thinking when I defeated Venom, said to be impossible to solo?

I vaguely remember—I was happy, I felt a sense of accomplishment, and I think I was basking in a feeling of superiority.

<b>

But still, I felt lonely. The terrible sense of loss hit me when I thought that there was no one above me anymore.

I still clearly remember that feeling being the strongest of all.

<b>

If this were the original game world, there might have been a possibility of new strong enemies being prepared by the developers.

New classes might appear, new weapons and skills might emerge, and level caps might be lifted; if I let my imagination run wild, I could think of quite a few possibilities.

<b>

But that doesn’t really matter anymore.

<b>

The world I am living in now is reality, not a game. There are beings that seem to be the developers, called gods, but it’s different from a game. And I have already found a new kind of enjoyment in this world that I never experienced on Earth.

That is the joy of nurturing.

<b>

"But still, it's a bit bittersweet."

<b>

To end this match.

<b>

The five members of the Moon party before me are already in a state of utter exhaustion.

I’ve taken some damage and my stamina is quite depleted, but not as much as them. I’m seriously risking my life here, and the hell I’ve been through is different from you guys, who are clones of Earthlings.

<b>

I lightly backstep to evade the attacks from the two sword saints who have lost their sharpness, and as soon as the enemy swings their swords, I counterattack. I strike them down as they try to retreat after taking damage.

<b>

"But I should wrap this up quickly. Now that I think about it, this isn’t a dungeon; it’s an arena. I completely forgot that there are spectators around."

<b>

Besides, if I let my guard down and they somehow pull off a comeback victory, it would be utterly embarrassing. That’s something I absolutely must avoid.

<b>

"If I get the chance again, I’ll fight you all—Moon. I’ll definitely be stronger by then."

<b>

I deliver the finishing blow to the two collapsing sword saints almost simultaneously.

And with the front line gone, the remaining three fall to my sword and magic in no time, like a stack of blocks toppling over.

<b>

The long, long death struggle... the fateful battle that has continued since my previous life has finally come to an end.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Like the monsters in the dungeon, the Moon party ascended into particles and vanished.

At the same time, the barrier that had covered the arena was lifted, and the voices of the audience surged from all directions except the ground. No, it’s really overwhelming. I feel like my eardrums are vibrating.

<b>

To be honest, I can’t hear what they are shouting at all because the various voices are mixing together. From the tone of their voices, I can only assume they’re not saying anything bad. It might be wishful thinking, but if I were in the audience, I would probably be offering words of praise.

<b>

After that, I drank a potion and received healing magic in the players' waiting room, and then I was to give a speech at the center of the arena. I wanted to say I needed a break, but since it seems that dignitaries from various countries have gathered, I understand that it’s better to say something to wrap things up, even with my tired brain.

<b>

With shaky steps, I made my way to the center of the stage, holding a magical amplification device, and as I looked around, the audience fell silent as if water had been poured over them. I thought there might be some noisy people, but it was surprisingly quiet. Could they be that eager to hear my words?

First, I opened my mouth and said, "Nice to meet you."

<b>

"I am SR, a party member of ASR from the Lindale Kingdom."

<b>

I’m used to standing in front of people, but I’m not accustomed to speaking in front of them. I started sweating profusely.

As I turned my head to look around, my teammates were waving at me near the stage. Their warm smiles helped me calm down a bit.

<b>

"I’m sure many of you have various questions swirling in your minds. 'Why wasn’t he in the martial arts tournament?' or 'What is that unknown skill?' or 'What is that white weapon?'—"

<b>

Now that the excitement of the match has settled, they are probably thinking about such things.

<b>

"Why I didn’t participate in the martial arts tournament—that’s simple. You are still in the process of growing. You will continue to improve. You will become stronger and stronger. So even if you faced me, who has finished growing a step ahead, unfortunately, the only future you would have is losing. Even if it were five against one... I think you would understand if you recall the match that just took place."

<b>

Those who can’t understand this are probably not explorers.

If you don’t accurately assess your opponent’s strength, you can easily lose your life in this world where resets are impossible.

<b>

"The skills and weapons—you will eventually understand them as you grow stronger without me having to teach you. You should confirm them with your own feet and eyes."

<b>

I think it’s fine to gather information, but there are those who find it more interesting to discover things on their own.

<b>

"Now, since I want to finish up quickly, let me say one last thing. My words may be a bit harsh, but... if you want to defeat me, if you want to claim the title of the Overlord, then first raise the level of all your classes to the maximum. If you think that’s impossible, then it’s also impossible for you to defeat me."

<b>

I will raise the other third classes to their maximum level—level 100. In other words, I will completely master all class skills. With anything less than extraordinary strength and determination, you won’t be able to reach me.

<b>

However, just as they are still unaware of their knowledge, I also do not yet know their true strength. I wonder how strong they can become once they learn about status bonuses.

<b>

So, I can’t help but feel hopeful. I hope they become stronger than the "Moon" and become obstacles for me. For now, the members of Thunderbolt and ASR seem promising.

<b>

"When everyone reaches that level, the world will surely look vastly different. You’ll probably laugh at the past when you stumbled in B-rank dungeons—so please, achieve this before I grow old."

<b>

Come challenge me and try to take the throne of the Overlord.

And remind me once again of the taste of defeat and the thirst for victory.

<b>

Well, I have no intention of losing, though!
