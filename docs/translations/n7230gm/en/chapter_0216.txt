# A-99 At the Guild

<b>

<b>

<b>

Along with the moving explorers, I, Noah, and Sera arrived at the training ground.

In the center, more than ten explorers had gathered, and there were a lot of spectators around the outer walls of the training ground. I don't know if they all see us as easy prey, but they are looking at us with grinning eyes.

<b>

"Why does it have to come to this...?"

<b>

We just came to the guild.

And it was all because of that annoying old man—he's probably around the same age as my former self, but well, it's his fault. You could say he's the root cause.

<b>

"Well then, let's have a knockout tournament! Hey, newbie! Come lend me your chest!"

<b>

"W-what!? Me!?"

<b>

At the voice of the drunken old man, a boy in his mid-teens, who looked out of place in the group, trembled nervously. By the way, didn't that old man just say "lend me your chest"?

Was he being sarcastic, or does he know about us? Which could it be?

<b>

"If you're the newbie, then I'll face you, as the weakest here."

<b>

Saying this, Sera stepped forward with a smile that didn't suit the word "weakest" at all. When Sera readied a wooden sword from her inventory, the boy also took a wooden sword in hand.

I mean, despite being a harassment event, this is a knockout tournament, a fair one-on-one match, and the opponent is using a wooden sword to ensure safety—what on earth is going on here?

<b>

"Alright! Let's begin!"

<b>

The moment the drunkard shouted, Sera dashed towards the trembling boy.

After all the provocation directed at us, the boy's fearful demeanor seemed like a high possibility of being a trap to deceive us—I had my doubts at that time too.

<b>

<b>

"…That was kind of anticlimactic."

<b>

Sera, thirteen consecutive wins. Yay. My wife is so strong.

No, wait! What is this farce!?

After glancing at the thirteen explorers sprawled around, I looked at the main instigator of this event, the old man.

He had somehow gotten into position with a wooden sword in front of Sera.

<b>

"I'm good with a bow, but I can manage a bit here too."

<b>

The old man, still red-faced, was swaying, probably due to the alcohol.

Then, he casually signaled "Start!" and ran towards Sera.

<b>

"Oh, surprisingly fast."

<b>

At least among the other explorers present, he was the fastest. He seemed to be the leader since he was directing everyone. The explorers truly embody the phrase "meritocracy."

<b>

"Hoh, you still seem capable of fighting."

<b>

"No, no, it's just that you all aren't normal; we're the ones who are."

<b>

While the two were engaged in a sword lock, they were conversing. However, Sera's STR status was obviously higher. She put in a strong effort and easily knocked the old man away.

As the old man landed gracefully, Sera went in for a follow-up attack—but,

<b>

"That's scary, hey!"

<b>

That decisive attack, which seemed like it would land, was blocked by the old man. Even Sera seemed surprised by that, momentarily halting her movements. The old man didn't miss that opportunity.

<b>

"Gotcha!"

<b>

He spun around and swung his sword horizontally with the momentum.

<b>

"—!? Not on my watch!"

<b>

Sera, in a fluster, swung her sword from below to above.

However, it seemed she miscalculated the force, shattering the old man's wooden sword. Moreover, she didn't stop there; she delivered a kick aimed at the old man's stomach.

<b>

"Whoa!?"

<b>

He didn't turn into a star—but he rolled around, getting tangled up with other explorers. I hope he didn't break any ribs...

Well, this should settle it.

But what to make of this atmosphere?

<b>

The victorious Sera looked at me, a bead of cold sweat dripping down her cheek. She mouthed "I went too far." Yeah, she might have gone a bit overboard. Let's hope the opponent's VIT is at least around C.

<b>

"I guess I didn't get my turn after all. Not that I wanted to fight, but I'm bored."

<b>

"I wanted to do a little."

<b>

"If you did, wouldn't it turn out worse than Sera?"

<b>

"Hmm, I intend to control my strength properly."

<b>

"Not in the sense that it wouldn't even be a fight."

<b>

Ah, I see. If that's the case, then it might indeed be true.

I don't want to be conceited, but the difference in stats is huge... Even thinking pessimistically, I can't envision a scenario where I would lose.

<b>

As I was talking with Noah like that, the old man stood up, muttering "Ouch." He then pulled out what looked like a high-grade potion from his inventory and gulped it down.

He approached us with the same unsteady gait he had before the fight.

From another direction, Sera was also walking towards us.

<b>

"You're relentless, 'Sword Princess.'"

<b>

"…Huh? Did you come at us knowing who we are?"

<b>

Seeing Sera tilt her head with a frown, the old man laughed heartily, "Hahaha!"

<b>

"I'm the guild master of the royal capital, and I've participated in the international martial arts tournament, you know? I keep track of the world's best party members, like the champions of the Thunderbolt's Trail."

<b>

Huh?

This old man is the guild master...? Moreover, he participated in the martial arts tournament with the Vinzett siblings? Seriously?

<b>

"See? Isn't it interesting?"

<b>

It seems Noah was aware of everything from the beginning, as she said that and chuckled beside me.
