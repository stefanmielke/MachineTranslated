# 45 So the next step after being a hero is to become a master...

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day after the mock battle with the guild master, I headed to a B-rank dungeon with my three party members.

This dungeon is located just a five-minute walk from the city, a place you could easily reach with a light stroll.

<b>

At the reception in front of the dungeon, thankfully, the receptionist who served as the referee in yesterday's match was there. Thanks to her, I was able to explain the situation and smoothly enter the dungeon.

It’s likely that Raileth instructed her to handle the reception.

<b>

<b>

The B-rank dungeon in Reinas is of the ruins type.

<b>

It has a labyrinthine structure, with a path width of only three meters. Therefore, it is not suitable for party battles and is easier for solo players like me.

<b>

This morning, before leaving the duke's residence, I was given a sword resembling my beloved black blade by Drag.

According to him, this sword with a reddish-black blade is not a drop item but a unique piece forged by a blacksmith.

<b>

When I tried putting it in my inventory, it was displayed as a red sword.

It’s a straightforward name, but after testing it in the duke's garden, its sharpness and durability felt equivalent to that of a drop item from an A-rank dungeon. In the gaming era, store-bought weapons were nothing special, but this was a pleasant surprise.

<b>

After that, Drag also gifted a sword to Sera, a bow to Shiri, and a dagger to Fenon.

As for armor, he mentioned that it was being custom-made, so I would have to wait a little longer.

<b>

I did indeed request armor for them, but I personally didn’t need any… However, since he seemed to have already started preparing, I couldn’t refuse.

<b>

<b>

“For now, try using your current abilities. I’ll point out areas that need correction as we go.”

<b>

“Understood.”

<b>

In the B-rank dungeon of Reinas, the monsters on the first floor are Golem Kongs. Their body shape resembles that of a gorilla, but unlike the gorillas seen on Earth, they lack body hair, and their bodies are covered in a rugged brick pattern.

<b>

As the monster approached us in a forward-leaning posture, Sera charged straight at it.

<b>

“Ha!”

<b>

Her current profession is a martial warrior—level 1.

Even though she’s level 1, she has seven player bonuses from level 30 and one from level 60. In this first layer, she might struggle, but she shouldn't lose.

While keeping an eye on Fenon and Shiri, I watched her battle, ready to jump in at any moment.

<b>

“You're putting too much power into each strike! Don’t aim to defeat it; attack to accumulate damage!”

<b>

“—Ugh, got it!”

<b>

“Never take your eyes off your opponent's attacks! That will create openings for you! —No, wrong! Don’t just look at the opponent's arm! Pay attention to the overall attack!”

<b>

Even during the fight, I continued to shout instructions at Sera.

Of course, after the battle, I would provide more detailed feedback. However, I felt it would be cruel to only point out mistakes, so I made sure to praise her for the good things and improvements.

<b>

Originally, I had very little experience in teaching others.

In real life, I wasn’t good enough to teach anyone, and in the game, I was basically a loner.

<b>

Therefore, I wasn’t sure if this was truly the correct way to instruct.

<b>

However, she trusted my guidance without any doubt and absorbed it like a sponge.

As a result, she succeeded in defeating the last monster in just half the time it took her to defeat the first Golem Kong.

<b>

She has a good sense, or perhaps her ability to absorb information is of a genius level. Or maybe it’s that my teaching is exceptionally good—though that seems unlikely.

It might simply be that Sera and I have good compatibility.

<b>

If she had a proper instructor, by the time I arrived in this world, she would have already conquered C-rank dungeons and challenged B-rank dungeons solo.

I should be grateful that it didn’t turn out that way. If she had gone solo, she might not even be in this world anymore.

<b>

After transferring to the second layer, I took over from Sera and steadily progressed through the subsequent layers as if I were completing a task.

<b>

The chosen profession is the advanced class of the brawler, the mighty warrior.

The player bonus gained at level 30 is AGI, which affects speed.

Once I finish leveling the mighty warrior to level 30, I plan to choose the heavy knight, which grants VIT next.

<b>

While defeating monsters, I instructed Sera with, “Listen up! Like this! Here, do it like this!” in a manner that didn’t seem like a proper teacher.

I learned that teaching someone while fighting is quite challenging. I had to rely on her understanding.

<b>

<b>

When we finished off the boss, it was already past 5 PM.

The boss dropped two superior potions. Unfortunately, they weren’t the drop items I was hoping for. But they are still useful.

<b>

Hmm… I think it might be tough to do another round. It took longer than I expected.

<b>

The reason is that I unexpectedly enjoyed teaching Sera, and I wanted to show off to Fenon and Shiri, who were cheering for my battles, so I ended up fighting in a somewhat flashy manner. I brought this upon myself.

<b>

“Since today is the first day, let’s head back. Starting tomorrow, we’ll do two rounds, so keep that in mind.”

<b>

“I’m sorry… I’ll work harder to defeat them faster tomorrow.”

<b>

You don’t have to apologize.

Most of it was my fault, and I think Sera did well.

<b>

“Understood! By the way, today, Lord SR was really cool! You truly felt like a hero!”

<b>

“Lord SR has a completely different atmosphere when fighting compared to usual. When I first met you, I thought you were a very gentle person, but when facing monsters, you seem like a mischievous boy—ah, I don’t mean that in a bad way! I’m complimenting you!”

<b>

“Hahaha, thank you both. I’ll keep you busy for a while longer, so I appreciate your support.”

<b>

“Not at all. I can’t thank Lord SR enough. I will definitely learn by watching your battles!”

<b>

When Fenon said that, Shiri nodded in agreement.

<b>

I appreciate that they say such things. I’ve been enjoying dungeon exploration alone, so I feel quite guilty about it.

<b>

Fighting monsters is, of course, fun, and the moment a drop item appears is exciting no matter how many times I experience it. Plus, I found teaching to be more enjoyable than I expected.

It might also be because Sera, who learns quickly, is my student, but seeing someone grow right in front of me is a wonderful thing.

<b>

After informing the receptionist that we were going home today, the four of us headed back to the duke's residence.

On the way back, Sera suddenly said as if she had just thought of it.

<b>

“Until the martial arts tournament, can I call you Master SR?”

<b>

She said this out of the blue, and I was surprised and stopped in my tracks.

Now that I think about it, when we celebrated the B-rank conquest before, Raika also jokingly called me Master. Is she imitating that?

<b>

“Eh… calling me Master seems like a hassle.”

<b>

“Your guidance today was more than enough. I feel like calling you that would help me focus more on my training.”

<b>

Training, huh… She should just take it easy. Could it be that Sera is the type to focus on appearances?

Well, if a simple name change motivates her, then it’s a small price to pay.

<b>

“...Fine. But that name is only until the martial arts tournament, okay? And only in the dungeon.”

<b>

“That’s fine! Thank you, Master!”

<b>

“I just said it’s only in the dungeon!”

<b>

When I said that, she hurriedly covered her mouth with both hands. Then, in that state, she said, “Fuaai,” and lightly bowed her head.

I assume she said, “I’m sorry.” It’s a miracle I could hear it. Fenon and Shiri laughed at her reaction.

<b>

And so, our days of dungeon exploration leading up to the martial arts tournament began. It wasn’t as grueling as during the Elixir days, nor was there any imminent danger.

While deepening our friendship, we were able to explore the dungeon very enjoyably.

<b>

<b>

It was a few days later that I realized she had shown signs of talent during this instruction.
