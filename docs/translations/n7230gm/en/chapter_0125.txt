# A-11 At the Explorer's Guild

<b>

<b>

<b>

It seemed like we could leisurely watch the parade from the Explorer's Guild—thinking that, we promptly started walking towards our destination.

<b>

We might inconvenience Regulus, the person in charge, a bit, but it can't be helped. I feel uneasy about pushing them into the crowd.

As a substitute, to lighten the burden on the guild members, we took quite a detour to the guild, calming fights along the way and capturing those who were scheming indiscriminately.

<b>

"In other words, we've significantly reduced the burden on the knights and the guild. Could you prepare a place for us to rest, considering how much we've worked? Oh, and of course, a room facing the street where we can see the parade."

<b>

"…You're getting more and more brazen—no, you were like that from the start. Right after coming to this world, you were saying things like 'let me have a one-on-one duel' and 'change the rules of the dungeon.'"

<b>

"That was because the rules were strange."

<b>

"Well, thinking back on it now, that's true."

<b>

Regulus said that and gave a small laugh without a hint of sarcasm, lifting the corners of his mouth.

He's still a wild old man. He seems like the type to demand a cigarette right before dying.

<b>

"As for the room, there's no problem. I had set aside a few rooms for when someone comes to make such selfish requests. Besides, you have the First Princess with you, so there's no way I could refuse you."

<b>

"Oh, but I'm an explorer now, you know?"

<b>

"Even if status doesn't matter, there are limits..."

<b>

Regulus's middle management demeanor showed a wry smile at Phenon's completely innocent reply.

It's not just about them, but those who have memories from before the collapse seem to have developed a certain bond. To put it simply, it feels like we've gotten much closer.

<b>

Speaking of which, didn't this H—say something about threats earlier? Seriously, what a bad impression.

<b>

Don't you think so too, Noah?

<b>

"I think that's quite on point—ouch, ouch! Don't crush my head!"

<b>

My self-proclaimed little sister's former manager desperately trying to shake off my iron claw.

<b>

Seeing her flailing around with teary eyes makes me feel like she's a different person from the Noah I knew in the collapsed world.

Back then, half of her body was discolored, and her smile was somewhat awkward, as if saying, "Don't enter my memories!" Now, seeing her with a beaming smile saying, "It's because I'm teary-eyed!" makes me feel that all the effort back then was worth it.

<b>

"Ah, it's peaceful."

<b>

"Are you even listening to me!?"

<b>

<b>

A private room on the third floor personally guided by Regulus.

The place, about the size of a school classroom, was furnished with sofas, tables, and decorative items, giving it more of a waiting room for dignitaries than a conference room.

<b>

When I opened the window and looked outside, I could clearly see the main street. Most of the surrounding buildings were two stories high, allowing for quite a distant view.

<b>

Looking at it again like this, the royal capital is indeed vast.

Depending on the direction you look, it seems like the buildings stretch on endlessly.

It would take a considerable amount of time for the three from Thunderbolt's Trail to make their rounds in the city. I would want to decline being a spectacle for such a long time.

<b>

"I checked with the guild master, and it seems Shin and the others will pass this way in about two hours."

<b>

"I've brewed some tea and coffee. I've also brought some snacks."

<b>

Sera and Shiri entered the room as they said this.

<b>

"Thanks for checking, Sera. And thank you, Shiri."

<b>

After expressing my gratitude, Noah and Pheno followed suit, each offering their thanks.

Sera, who was slightly shy and wandering her gaze, was as cute as ever, and Shiri, showing an exquisitely perfect smile, was indeed beautiful.

<b>

<b>

Once everyone settled on the sofas and took a breather, the topic naturally turned to the 'International Martial Arts Tournament' that Shin and the others had won.

<b>

"Do you think Esuar would have won even if we had participated?"

<b>

"Hmm, I can't say for sure since I don't know the opponents, but... I think they could win? Even without me and Noah, they have a significant advantage in terms of stats."

<b>

Technically, Pheno and Shiri might be a bit of a hindrance, but Sera is exceptionally skilled, and the party's balance is good due to their professions, allowing for effective teamwork.

<b>

Even if Sera and the others had participated in the martial arts tournament instead of Thunderbolt's Trail, the victory for the Lindell Kingdom would not have been shaken.

<b>

Without even needing to see the strength of explorers from other countries firsthand, I could imagine their skill level since they hadn't cleared B-rank dungeons before the collapse, and considering the current dungeon clearing situation, the ASR party is superior to those from other countries.

<b>

Still, when it comes to party battles, they can't quite match Thunderbolt's Trail.

<b>

"Besides, the opposing countries were all five-member parties, right?"

<b>

"Seems so."

<b>

"I heard that even so, Shin and the others were quite relaxed. If you guys can give Thunderbolt's Trail a good fight, you shouldn't lose."

<b>

Even if there happened to be a draw, with five against three, it would essentially be our victory.

<b>

Sera had a difficult expression, as if she agreed with my words but also didn't. In contrast, Pheno and Shiri seemed unconcerned, nodding along as they listened to me.

<b>

I also want to see how the explorers from other countries measure up in battle, but if the opponent puts up a good fight, it might become enjoyable, and I might accidentally defeat them, which is scary. After all, I have a history of clashing with Thunderbolt's Trail in the previous martial arts tournament.

<b>

As I was thinking about that, Noah, sitting next to me, turned her gaze towards the window and began to giggle meaningfully. It felt a bit noisy outside; perhaps she heard something interesting.

<b>

"What are you laughing at?"

<b>

"Hehe, it's nothing. I just thought things might get interesting soon."

<b>

"Is it about the parade?"

<b>

"Not really... well, you'll find out soon enough."

<b>

As Noah wore a grin, the four of us tilted our heads in confusion.

The fact that she wasn't sharing immediately might be revenge for my earlier iron claw. If she, the former goddess, says we'll find out soon, then it must be true, so I won't push to find out.

<b>

What could it be, I wonder—while waiting with a bit of a foggy mind, two hours passed.

The long-awaited carriage carrying Thunderbolt's Trail finally arrived in front of the guild.
