# 91 Leave it to me

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Phenon and the others—everyone in this world will lose their memories of me.

Even if I somehow manage to defeat Venom... it seems that in the newly created world, no one will remember me.

<b>

The fact that Phenon deliberately calls me "Hero," that Siri smiles and says "Welcome back," and that Shin and the others call me "Master" with grins—those things will no longer exist.

<b>

They are the noble daughters of earls and royalty at the top of the kingdom.

Once the new world is created, I will just be a commoner. They might not even glance in my direction after I lose my status.

<b>

"…It's almost time."

<b>

Noah says this to me, who has lost my words and is standing there in a daze.

I couldn't respond or even look at her face. All I could do was stare blankly at the empty space.

<b>

"Let's meet again after we conquer the dungeon."

<b>

As Noah murmurs this, my vision suddenly turned completely white, as if lightning had struck right in front of me.

I instinctively shut my eyes and grimaced, lifting my eyelids.

When I opened my eyes, a snowy field spread out before me. The light of the full moon illuminated the snow, and the withered trees scattered around as if mimicking my frozen stance.

<b>

As that scenery entered my view, my brain automatically concluded, "This is an S-rank dungeon that appears in the Lindel Kingdom in the game."

<b>

This damp and dark dungeon is just right for me now. I'm glad it's not a grand dungeon with a blue sky.

<b>

"Hmm! This is my first time seeing a snow dungeon!"

<b>

I heard such a voice from right next to me.

When I turned my face, I saw Sera stepping on the snow repeatedly as if checking the ground. She looked somewhat happy, and it wasn't just my imagination. She seemed like a child.

<b>

"Yeah."

<b>

"…? SR, don't you look a bit pale? Is this perhaps a dungeon you don't know about?"

<b>

Sera spoke to me as she peered into my face. Is she sharp or just perceptive to the changes in my expression?

She hasn't noticed that Shin has disappeared or that Suzu has vanished.

And she doesn't know that I will lose my memories forever.

<b>

I exhaled strongly.

<b>

"No, I know it. I've conquered this dungeon many times in the world I was in before."

<b>

There's no need to hide it anymore. After all, she will forget everything.

Ignoring her gaping mouth, I continued to walk forward while talking to search for monsters.

<b>

"It's not completely the same, but over 90% is the same. I raised the levels of all professions to their limits there and have experience conquering all dungeons, including S-rank dungeons, solo."

<b>

There was no reply from Sera. Instead, I could hear crunching footsteps approaching from behind.

<b>

"This is my second time leveling up like this. So I know about derived secondary and tertiary jobs. I know about drop items. I know about monsters. I know things that Sera and the others don't."

<b>

It's only in the game, though— I whispered so she wouldn't hear.

After a brief pause, I continued speaking.

<b>

"If I defeat the boss of the S-rank dungeon—Venom, it seems this world will return to normal."

<b>

There's no need to mention that the win rate is below 0.1 percent. Just saying it would only stir up anxiety.

However, there are things I must say. To make the most of the last moments.

<b>

I spotted a Snow Tiger, a monster of the first floor. It had a robust physique that seemed to be three times mine and moved swiftly as if it didn't feel the snow beneath it.

<b>

"It seems that when it returns to normal, Sera and the others will forget about me. Just a moment ago, the Creator God told me so."

<b>

"Wha—!?"

<b>

The monster noticed us and charged toward us with great force.

Was Sera's surprise in response to my words? Or was it due to the monster's rush, as if a car were about to crash into us?

<b>

I jumped up to dodge the sharp claws of the enemy's forelegs that were reaching out and plunged my red sword straight into its forehead. In an instant, the monster transformed into particles and vanished.

With my current stats, as long as I don't miss the timing or the target, it's easy to take down an enemy in one blow.

<b>

"…Is there really no way to change this?"

<b>

Sera asked cautiously.

She doesn't doubt that I spoke with the Creator God. I think it's pretty unbelievable content.

<b>

Without turning back, I continued to walk forward.

<b>

"Who knows? But if there is a way to change it, I'm sure you'll tell me."

<b>

From Noah's tone, it felt like "an unavoidable future." No matter how much I specialize in evasion, there are things I can't avoid that aren't physical.

<b>

Speaking of which, Noah said "return to normal," but when will that be?

Before conquering the A-rank dungeon? At the timing I was summoned? Or even before that?

<b>

I don't know.

<b>

Since Noah said there would be time to talk after conquering the dungeon, I should confirm it then.

Depending on the situation, there might not be a chance to meet Phenon in the newly created world.

After all, it's commoner and royalty.

<b>

The response faded, and all I could hear from behind was footsteps, but I continued regardless.

<b>

"If that means Phenon and Siri and the Thunder's Trace will revive, then it's a small price to pay—ah... I know you don't know who I'm talking about right now, but they are our comrades. It's sad that memories will be lost, but we can create new ones."

<b>

Speaking to Sera in that manner, I was trying to convince myself.

That's right—if it's memories, we can make them again. Get to know each other once more, explore together again, and have meals together again. I hope there will be opportunities for that.

<b>

I stopped and turned to look back.

Sera, who had been looking down, turned to me with a tearful expression.

<b>

Please stop; I'll start crying too.

<b>

"I don't know what state things will be in after you all disappear, but well, please wait patiently. I will definitely return this world to normal."

<b>

No matter how many years it takes in the process, I will do it.

<b>

Even if it goes according to the will of the gods, I don't care.

Even if it becomes a life-or-death battle, I don't care.

Even if it... doesn't remain in anyone's memory, I don't care.

<b>

Because the comrades I met in this world are more important than anything else.

<b>

I love Phenon and Sera.

<b>

So—,

<b>

"Leave it to me."

<b>

I said shyly.

In truth, I wanted to go home right now and scream and cry, but I'm a man too.

<b>

Even if I want to look cool in front of the person I love at least once, no one would complain.
