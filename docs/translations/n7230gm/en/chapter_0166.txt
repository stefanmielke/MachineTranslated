# A-50 The Premonition of a Date

<b>

<b>

Neska-san, after stumbling back a few steps, ended up sitting on her rear.

Although she is showing us a rather pitiful sight, her appearance is that of a cute beauty. Her cherry-colored hair, just short of reaching her shoulders, looks fluffy just by its appearance. She has slightly upturned eyes, double eyelids, and long eyelashes. Normally, she might give off a dignified impression, but unfortunately, my current impression of her is that of a frightened Chihuahua.

<b>

Hmm. I'm struggling to determine what would be an appropriate thing to say.

I could pretend not to see her, or simply ask, "Are you okay?" No, what if I deliberately startled her with a loud "Whoa!"? Yeah... it's definitely not something I should do on a first meeting.

<b>

However, even if I wanted to greet her like a proper adult by recalling old memories, she is still trembling, and forcing a conversation in this state feels a bit cruel. She is wearing something tight enough to outline her body under her skirt, which is not underwear, and I find myself at a loss regarding where to look. Also, I feel several prickling gazes from behind piercing into the back of my head.

<b>

So, 

<b>

"I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'll pass through."

<b>

Without waiting for a response, I decided to bypass the receptionist, Mei-san, while pretending not to notice Neska-san. Either way, staying in that position was not good for my line of sight.

Moreover, I'm not lying. I really am in a hurry.

I can't keep the prince waiting, and I can't waste time in a place like this.

<b>

"Excuse me."

<b>

"I'll see you again tomorrow."

<b>

As I passed by, Sera and Fenon quietly greeted the representative of the Palmour Kingdom, who was in a state of shock.

I couldn't see Neska-san's reaction to that, but judging from the lack of a response, she probably just nodded. Or maybe she was so surprised that she couldn't even make a sound.

<b>

"Ah, um—Neska-san! Please wait a moment! I'll be right back!"

<b>

Mei-san said this with a flustered expression and ran over to us, who were walking straight ahead without knowing where to go.

<b>

"I-I'm sorry to keep you waiting! I'll guide you!"

<b>

"Ahaha... I'm sorry for making it feel forced. —By the way, I also have a letter addressed to Neska-san from His Majesty, should it go through the Guild Master? Or should I hand it directly?"

<b>

As we moved forward, I took out the letter from the envelope and showed it to Mei-san.

<b>

"I see. What did His Majesty say?"

<b>

"Nothing in particular. I think he probably didn't expect us to meet Neska-san."

<b>

"I understand... In that case, let's talk to the Guild Master first. I'll inform Neska-sama to stay at the Guild later."

<b>

"Understood. Thank you."

<b>

Mei-san nodded at my words, showing her agreement.

Then she knocked on the door at the end of the hallway, confirmed the response from inside, and guided us into the room.

After finishing our conversation with the Guild Master, the five of us were having lunch at a recommended dining place that was just a few minutes' walk from the Explorer's Guild.

The discussion this time went smoothly without any issues, and unlike the previous encounter with Riles-san, we were not challenged to a test of strength, allowing us to easily obtain a document exempting us from the obligation to present our statuses. In any case, this brings a sense of relief.

I had expected someone intimidating like Regulus-san to appear, but contrary to my expectations, the person in the office was a woman in her forties. She had a friendly demeanor, reminiscent of a relative aunt. However, she didn't invade our personal space to the point of discomfort, which left a good impression on me.

But, just like His Majesty and the Queen, the powerful figures in this country seem to have an oddly friendly atmosphere.

<b>

"There were some minor irregularities, but we might have a bit of time to see the town."

<b>

After swallowing a mouthful of hamburger, I made that remark while observing the reactions of the four.

<b>

"That's true. But since we’re traveling by carriage, it might be difficult unless we can get off at places that catch our interest along the way. If we could run around on the rooftops, we could visit various places."

<b>

Noah laughed with a mischievous grin. I sighed and replied, "That’s not allowed."

<b>

"SR-san, is there anywhere you’re particularly interested in?"

<b>

After Noah's words, Shiri asked. I thought she should be asking Fenon for his opinion given her position—yet it seemed the princess herself was eagerly waiting for my words. Well, if that's what they want, then I'm fine with it.

<b>

"Well... I can roughly imagine what shops related to explorers would have, so I'm more interested in luxury items or the atmosphere of the town. I think it would be fine to just enter a shop that catches our interest, like Noah mentioned earlier."

<b>

"Indeed, I have no objections either. If we look at the prices of potions, we might get a sense of this country's level, but... this is a time of great upheaval. Prices will likely drop again within a month, so there's no point in worrying too much about it."

<b>

"If you're really curious, you could ask Neska-san, who will be exploring with us tomorrow."

<b>

"That's true."

<b>

"Yeah. So let's forget about work-like things and enjoy the date since we can finally walk freely in the town!"

<b>

"Y-Yeah! This is like a honeymoon!"

<b>

It feels a bit different from a date or honeymoon, but since they said so, I’ll refrain from denying it. However, my dear wives, let’s not forget there are two others here besides you.

As I pondered how to excuse myself to Shiri and Noah, I turned to face them—

<b>

"So, a date... hehehe."

<b>

"A sibling date, huh."

<b>

Both seemed to be lost in some kind of fantasy, oblivious to my gaze. So you both were thinking of it as a date too.

In the end, I neither affirmed nor denied the idea of a date, instead diverting my gaze to the meal in front of me.
