# A-126 Lost Child Exploration

<b>

<b>

<b>

Together with Jade and Crescent, we explored the surrounding area of what seemed like a residential neighborhood for about three hours.

I tried to search for monsters while being careful not to lose track of my current location as I entered areas where I couldn't see the surrounding forest, but in the end, I could only collect two medals.

<b>

Engaging with monsters was fairly enjoyable, but I didn't encounter any boss-class monsters.

<b>

"It's refreshing to have different types of monsters attacking together."

<b>

I've encountered a very diverse range of monsters so far, including wolf-type monsters, worm-type monsters that burrow underground, bird-type, insect-type, and so on. Moreover, they can appear simultaneously. This is something that wasn't present in previous dungeons.

<b>

Earlier, I had to fight while paying attention to three wolves, two wyvern-like monsters, and one worm-type monster, keeping an eye on above, below, and in front. These guys are even more troublesome than the bosses.

<b>

"Tempest only had one type, right? Now that the number of types has become almost infinite, it seems like a tough place for those who were just relying on their knowledge to fight."

<b>

"Yeah."

<b>

If monster A had five types of responses, previously you only needed to remember those five types, but now, if we add five types of responses for monster B, just having these two monsters attack together creates over thirty different patterns, including the order of attacks. Even having multiple of the same monster increases the responses, but when they are different species, it becomes even more complicated.

<b>

As Jade said, relying solely on knowledge for responses can be quite difficult. If three or four different types of monsters were to attack, it would be a nightmare――

<b>

"Well, that's how ranking battles feel, right? Thinking about it that way, the people from Tempest were amazing."

<b>

"Oh? Are you bragging? The SR who challenged party battles solo."

<b>

Crescent poked me in the side with her elbow while saying this. She has a rather unpleasant smile... Well, I prefer being liked over being disliked, so I'll take it.

<b>

"That wasn't my intention... but it's not just me; even in five-on-five situations, the thought process is the same, right? Or rather, since you have to consider your teammates, it might be even more complicated?"

<b>

"I don't think so? There are certainly a lot of patterns, but when considering effective strategies among them, the options narrow down significantly."

<b>

"That's true."

<b>

It's not just about the patterns; when we adopt a defensive stance, the opponent won't necessarily do the same, and when we try to deliver a fatal blow, the opponent is unlikely to ignore that attack.

<b>

Regarding the latter, there are also desperate strikes, so while the likelihood is low, it still needs to be considered.

Well, that's beside the point; right now, it's about the medals.

<b>

"If we can't find many after searching this much... we should either expand our search area or go to the forests or mountains we haven't visited yet."

<b>

"Exactly. Since we can use emergency return, we won't get lost and stranded―― so it might be fine to explore with the premise of getting lost."

<b>

"Oh, Princess, that's a good point! I'm in favor of Princess's idea!"

<b>

Exploring with the premise of getting lost... indeed, that might be what we should do.

<b>

"Then let's do that. I can see a mountain over there, so let's head there. The forest seems pretty dense, but that means there should be plenty of monsters."

<b>

Upon further thought, it's actually the monsters in the plains that are rarer. Without any cover, the range of strategies becomes significantly narrower. I don't know if monsters have strategies or not.

<b>

And so, we decided to embark on an exploration with the premise of getting lost.

<b>

<b>

<b>

As we stepped into the forest at the foot of the mountain that seemed to be the closest, everyone felt a slight tension in the air. While I, the Overlord, and Crescent, the Sword Saint, have skills to sense presence, Jade, the Demon King, does not. It's understandable since the visibility is poor, and she has to rely more on her hearing.

<b>

"---But then, it's the three of us. It's not that tense."

<b>

"Same here."

<b>

"Me too. Even if I don't respond, the two of you will probably handle it."

<b>

"It would be better if we avoid everyone thinking that way and ending up in pain."

<b>

That's very true.

Thinking "someone else will handle it" is the worst mindset in battle.

<b>

We proceeded along a difficult path, cutting through tall grass and vines that obstructed our way.

There were open areas, but also places where it was difficult to proceed normally, yet we walked straight through the forest almost in a straight line.

Then, as we approached the mountainside, we found a cave.

<b>

"A dungeon within a dungeon..."

<b>

"There are probably monsters inside this one too. It looks quite deep."

<b>

The cave that appeared before us was a massive one, likely ten meters high. A river flowed through the center, but it wasn't particularly wide. While the path was about ten meters wide, the river was only about two meters wide.

<b>

"We can't see the end of it, so shall we just go in?"

<b>

As she said this, Jade prepared a spell and lit her fingertip. That alone seemed to secure some visibility inside the cave. It was dim, but not completely dark.

<b>

In previous dungeons, the insides of caves were bright, or they had torches set up on the walls. However, this dungeon seems to be different. Well, it's not just a dungeon; it's a cave within a dungeon.

<b>

"Now then, I wonder what kind of monsters are inside."

<b>

I hope there are monsters that drop medals.
