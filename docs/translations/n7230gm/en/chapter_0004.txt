# 3 The Authority of Nobility

<b>

<b>

<b>

Leaving the royal castle, I arrived in the town below. It was already getting dark. Checking the time on the menu, it was already past 7 PM.

<b>

The streets illuminated by streetlights and moonlight, as well as the people passing by, looked a bit different from the game.

It seems there is indeed a difference between things created by the system and reality. That's to be expected.

<b>

My reflection in the window glass looked as if my familiar SR avatar had been summoned into the real world.

<b>

Enjoying the fresh feeling, I headed towards an inn. Thinking about the princess, I didn't want to waste too much time. Therefore, I searched for an inn where I could also have a meal.

The inn I found charged 500 orl per night with breakfast included. It seemed that for an additional fee, dinner could also be had.

After paying for 30 days in advance and receiving the key, I headed towards the Explorer's Guild without even properly checking the room.

<b>

"You're so overprotective."

<b>

When I informed His Majesty and the Prime Minister that I intended to make a living as an explorer, I faced strong opposition. They said it was dangerous and that they wouldn't let me suffer inconveniences for money—temptations that could lead to becoming a freeloader. However, I firmly declared that I would become an explorer.

<b>

The main reason was not just about the princess—there was simply no other option for me but to become an explorer in this world. This is a world where one must delve into dungeons.

<b>

Once the situation with the princess settles down, I promised to slowly share stories about the other world—successfully persuading the two of them. It felt just like having overprotective parents.

<b>

"I really want to go to a dungeon soon."

<b>

To delve into a dungeon, a license is required.

The institution that issues that license is the Explorer's Guild. In addition to issuing licenses, this place also handles the purchase of drop items and requests for deliveries.

<b>

Based on my knowledge from the game, I arrived at the Explorer's Guild without hesitation.

It looked like a government office you would see in Japan. Upon entering the building, there was a tavern on the left, a reception desk on the right, and the second floor was a materials room. It seemed just like the game.

The tavern was quite noisy, perhaps due to people drinking after work. Ignoring it, I walked towards the reception desk.

<b>

"I'd like to register."

<b>

I spoke to the receptionist, who seemed to be bored.

When I called out to her, she straightened her back as if to say, "I'm not slacking off!" and neatly stacked the documents she had.

<b>

"Registration, huh? It will cost you 1,000 orl as a license issuance fee. Is that alright?"

<b>

"Yes."

<b>

I took out the money from my inventory and placed it on the counter. After receiving the money, the receptionist handed me a registration form and a pen in return.

<b>

I quickly filled in the necessary details.

Even though it was a different world, everything was in Japanese since it originated from a game.

In the occupation field, I wrote "swordsman," one of the primary classes. I had quickly selected my occupation from the status screen before arriving at the Explorer's Guild.

I would probably become a brawler within three days anyway, so I didn't see the point in writing my occupation here, but if asked to write it, I would do so obediently.

<b>

"I have a few questions. Could you spare me some time?"

<b>

I asked as I handed the filled-out paper to the receptionist.

She glanced at the registration form and smiled.

<b>

"Your name is SR, right? Yes, that's fine."

<b>

"Thank you. First of all—"

<b>

After that, I bombarded her with questions.

I wanted to know why I couldn't even clear a B-rank dungeon.

<b>

Were the monsters more vicious than in the game?

<b>

Was the B-rank dungeon they referred to really the same B-rank dungeon I knew?

<b>

Or was there some other reason?

<b>

To resolve those questions, I continued to confirm details with her down to the last detail.

I finally came to terms with the current situation about an hour later. The receptionist looked completely exhausted.

<b>

"Well, it's no wonder you can't clear a B-rank dungeon..."

<b>

I muttered with a wry smile and a sigh.

<b>

This is terrible. It's just too terrible.

It's not that the people of this world are at fault.

<b>

It's just that various factors have come together to create this hopeless situation.

<b>

<b>

VRMMO Tempest.

What is the most important thing in this game? If asked, I would immediately answer, "Leveling up."

<b>

Each profession has its own levels, and by leveling them up, you can choose new professions, and your stats will rise accordingly.

<b>

For example, let's say you initially chose the swordsman profession.

<b>

The maximum level for primary professions is 50. In addition to the swordsman's stats increasing with level-ups, at level 30, there is a "Player Bonus" that increases stats.

<b>

This Player Bonus is something that carries over even after changing from swordsman to another profession; it is literally something given to the "player" themselves.

<b>

Therefore, while it is basic to level up each profession evenly, in this world, stats are not visible. In other words, you can't notice the Player Bonus.

<b>

As a result, many players neglect the relatively easy-to-level primary professions and immediately switch to secondary professions like swordmaster, starting to focus on leveling those up.

How inefficient...

<b>

But that doesn't concern me.

The level display exists, and I know which professions to level up to which level.

<b>

If there is a problem, it is another factor.

<b>

"Is there any way to allow primary professions—or even lower-tier professions—to enter E-rank or D-rank dungeons?"

<b>

It seems that in this world, primary professions are referred to as lower-tier professions, and secondary professions as upper-tier professions.

The elusive fourth-tier profession "Overlord" is, of course, unknown, and it seems that neither secondary nor tertiary professions are recognized. I will refer to primary professions as lower-tier professions to align with them.

<b>

"I'm sorry, but it's a rule... Before this rule was established, there were quite a few deaths in E-rank dungeons. It's to protect the explorers."

<b>

"I understand that, but..."

<b>

In this game, losing to monsters means death. I couldn't effectively counter her argument since I had experienced dying many times in E-rank dungeons.

<b>

However, if I were to level up in an F-rank dungeon, it would be impossible to clear a B-rank dungeon in a month. No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible.

<b>

This is bad; this is really bad.

<b>

As I pondered whether there was some kind of cheat method, I heard a loud voice from the next reception desk.

<b>

"How many times do I have to say it! Let me go to a B-rank dungeon! I don't have time!"

<b>

I turned my gaze towards the source of the voice along with the receptionist who was assisting me.

<b>

There stood a trembling staff member with a frightened expression and a woman who appeared to be an explorer, characterized by her bright red long hair. It seemed that the red-haired woman was complaining to the receptionist.

<b>

"I-I apologize, Lady Sera! It’s not that I want to enforce the rules, but you cannot enter a B-rank dungeon without having cleared a C-rank dungeon due to the mechanics of the dungeons."

<b>

"I'm telling you to make an exception! Who do you think I am!"

<b>

From the conversation I overheard, it seemed that the woman wanted to enter a B-rank dungeon even though she hadn't cleared a C-rank dungeon yet.

<b>

Indeed, that would be impossible.

Without a license that records having cleared a C-rank dungeon, the teleportation function to a B-rank dungeon wouldn't work. Moreover, licenses cannot be used by anyone other than the holder, making lending and borrowing impossible.

<b>

"Is it okay to leave that alone? The receptionist looks like she’s about to cry."

<b>

"I-I really want to help, but since it's Lady Sera... One of the staff just ran to the back, so the guild master should be coming soon."

<b>

While we were whispering and having that conversation, a group of three—a man and two women—approached the red-haired woman from the direction of the tavern.

A refreshing-looking blonde man with a sword at his waist, a woman dressed like a church sister, and a woman wearing light bikini armor.

<b>

"Is there a problem?"

<b>

The blonde man asked shortly.

I was frustrated but couldn't help but admire his good looks. I thought, "Please just perish. Then I could become handsome by default," but then I remembered that my avatar was also quite handsome. Alright, I’ll let it slide for today.

<b>

At the blonde man's voice, the red-haired woman turned around sharply.

<b>

"—! Shin! This has nothing to do with you!"

<b>

"It does concern me. I was having a good time drinking, but your shouting ruined my mood. Since you couldn't join our party, now you're trying to get help from the guild, right?"

<b>

"Shut up! I don't have time to deal with you! Get lost!"

<b>

"...Sigh. You know, all three of us have B-rank licenses and a long history. You're a C-rank. No matter how much of a count's daughter you are, our standing is higher here. You shouldn't be telling your seniors to 'get lost.'"

<b>

The blonde man shrugged as if to say, "What a hassle." The red-haired woman glared at him, her eyes wide like an agitated cat.

<b>

Oh.

So the red-haired woman is a noble. When I think of nobles, I usually imagine either the graceful and elegant type who would laugh with a "ufufu" or the very selfish type who would say "ohoho." I guess there are types like this too. A new discovery.

<b>

"When nobles like that flaunt their authority, it puts us in a difficult position. Even if status doesn't matter among explorers, it’s scary if there’s retaliation."

<b>

"That's certainly scary. I’d prefer not to get involved with nobles if possible."

<b>

"Me too."

<b>

Unlike the atmosphere over there, we were having a leisurely conversation.

Nobles, huh... Speaking of which, the king told me that if I got involved with some strange noble, I should just show them my dagger.

<b>

...........Could this be useful right now?

<b>

Having come up with a brilliant idea, I quickly took out the dagger with the royal emblem from my inventory and showed it to the receptionist in front of me.

<b>

Upon seeing it, the receptionist's expression froze. Sweat began to drip down her face, and the droplets falling from her chin started to stain the registration form.

<b>

"Could you please allow me to enter E-rank and D-rank dungeons, regardless of my profession?"

<b>

I smiled broadly, flaunting the authority of a noble.
