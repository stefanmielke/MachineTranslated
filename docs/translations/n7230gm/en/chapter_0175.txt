# A-59 For the Time Being, With All My Might

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Well, well..."

<b>

A-rank dungeon, first floor.

Currently, Neska-san is engaged in combat with the first monster of significance, and we are watching from behind.

The enemy looks like a Komodo dragon with a crest, having minimal wings but not flying. It features attacks with claws and fangs, as well as wind magic akin to a slicing wind.

<b>

Neska-san, having jumped to evade the enemy's magic, slashes at the enemy's body with her sword.

There may be endless details to nitpick, but I think she could handle an A-rank dungeon solo without any issues—provided she has gained a certain level of status bonuses.

<b>

"Haahhh!"

<b>

About fifteen minutes into the battle—Neska-san's fierce strike turned the enemy into particles.

<b>

I see, I see... I had a hunch from watching the Vinsent siblings, participants in the Rezel martial arts tournament, but being the top explorer in the country seems to be at this level.

Given this, even if the status bonuses were unknown, the Thunderbolt's trajectory would have been the strongest. Though I haven't seen her party's coordination yet, so it's just speculation.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work, Neska-san. It was very informative."

<b>

I offered words of encouragement to Neska-san, who was catching her breath. Beside me, Niz-kun, along with Sera and Noah, was applauding.

<b>

"Haah, haah... Thank you. However, I can't believe my level of swordsmanship could be of any help to SR-sama..."

<b>

Neska-san is being quite modest.

It's true that there weren't any actions in her battle that I would want to adopt, but watching others fight is interesting. It also serves as good fuel to ignite my own fighting spirit.

<b>

"What are you talking about? You're a member of the representative party of the Palmour Kingdom, right? I think you should have more confidence."

<b>

I spoke in an encouraging tone. However, Neska-san smiled wryly and shook her head.

<b>

"Yes. But after seeing a match like that, I realize just how lacking my efforts are."

<b>

"Ah... You're talking about the arena match?"

<b>

"Yes, that's right."

<b>

To the people of this world, my match with "Tsuki" must have seemed like a level from another dimension... The skills I used must have been a mystery, and my stats in strength and speed are vastly different from theirs.

Moreover, both Tsuki and I are explorers capable of easily defeating bosses in S-rank dungeons and have even cleared SS-rank dungeons.

The number of life-and-death situations we've faced compared to the people they've been competing against is on a completely different scale.

<b>

When I was just starting with Tempest, I couldn't understand the movements of the top-tier players either. Surely, the sensation she feels is similar to what I felt back then.

<b>

"First, level up. And if you keep running through dungeons, you'll become even stronger, Neska-san. But remember, if you die, that's the end, so don't push yourself too hard."

<b>

"That's right! You absolutely mustn't do anything dangerous!"

<b>

After my words, Sera said with a slightly proud puffing of her chest.

<b>

How nostalgic... that phrase. Not long after I came to this world, I made Sera promise me not to do anything dangerous.

I wonder if she still remembers that time?

...Knowing Sera, she would probably confidently say, "Of course! I remember!"

<b>

Neska-san responded to my and Sera's words with a cheerful, "Understood!"

I felt like I was training a new recruit. Though she is, after all, a representative of the Palmour Kingdom.

<b>

Ahem.

<b>

"Alright, then from here on, let's take over. Noah... it doesn't matter which way, but Sera, you need to study hard to be able to handle the new monsters."

<b>

"Understood!"

<b>

After Sera replied in a good voice, 

<b>

"—Wait, I'm doing it too! Since I'm your little sister, you need to properly guide me, big brother!"

<b>

Noah protested with an expression that clearly showed her dissatisfaction.

Speaking of which, she was supposed to be my little sister. She has so many titles, like being a former god or a brat, it's tough.

<b>

"That last one isn't a title!"

<b>

To calm the self-proclaimed little sister who was chirping beside me, I lightly patted her head when Neska-san timidly spoke up.

<b>

"If possible—I'd like to see SR-sama fight alone. I want to see how you would defeat the opponent I fought."

<b>

Of course, she added that she wasn't insisting, and then bowed her head.

<b>

Hmm... It's not that I mind her bowing, but I wouldn't have any problem with that. In fact, even if she hadn't said anything, there was a good chance I would have charged into the monsters myself.

After all, I had just seen Neska-san's battle, and my fighting instincts are fully stimulated right now.

<b>

"Of course, that's fine. Would you prefer to see my techniques or me going all out? —Oh, a monster is coming!"

<b>

As I asked Neska-san, I heard footsteps approaching from the direction we were heading. It was still dim, so I couldn't see it completely, but I could discern from the faint silhouette that it was a monster.

<b>

"T-There are options... Then, for now, I'll go all out."

<b>

"Understood!"

<b>

After replying to Neska-san, I exchanged glances with Noah and Sera, signaling them to "take care of each other." Noah, who can use mind-reading, and Sera, who has been with me for a long time, both nodded in understanding.

<b>

With my white lotus in one hand, I confidently closed the distance to the monster without hesitation. Eventually, the monster noticed our presence and charged at us with a growl.

<b>

A monster that attacks like a bear, with its arms and mouth wide open.

<b>

"You're slow."

<b>

As expected of an A-rank dungeon. Its sluggishness could almost make me yawn.

<b>

I activated body enhancement while dodging the monster's attack by crouching diagonally, and as I stood up, I swung the white lotus towards the enemy's belly. Then, I immediately spun around and slashed again at the scarred area where the special effect of the white lotus—White Radiance—was activated.

<b>

With just that, the enemy began to turn into particles.

<b>

The enemy's weak point is its thin-scaled belly. Moreover, my stats are high, and the white lotus is a powerful weapon classified as a rare drop from S-rank dungeons.

<b>

Enemies in the first floor of an A-rank dungeon don't take more than five seconds.

Even so, the reason it takes time to clear A-rank dungeons is simply because there are quite a few monsters, and each floor is spacious, making it cumbersome to search for monsters.

<b>

"Well, that should be about it."

<b>

I said while turning around.

There stood Niz-kun and Neska-san, both with their mouths agape.
