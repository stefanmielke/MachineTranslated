In the first place, the upper echelon has too much experience, and newcomers can't compete.

<b>

0228: Anonymous Strongest

Well, if you want to fully take the status bonuses, it would take years… but if you work hard at it, you too can become a top-ranked player! You did it!

<b>

If it were that easy, it wouldn't be a struggle… those people should have used their talents in other areas. If they had done sports, they might have been really good, right? Their reflexes are amazing, aren't they?

<b>

0233: Anonymous Strongest

That's impossible.

<b>

0241: Anonymous Strongest

You shouldn't confuse reality with games.

Well, I don't know about people like "Tsuki" and those around them.

<b>

0243: Anonymous Strongest

Those people are in a different category… because they are professionals making money from the game.

They exist on a different dimension from us NEETs.

<b>

0244: Anonymous Strongest

Hey, I work (home security).

<b>

0245: Anonymous Strongest

Could you not lump me in with NEETs? (home security)

<b>

0254: Anonymous Strongest

You must not forget that there are people who made that professional gamer say "we exist on a different dimension."

<b>

0255: Anonymous Strongest

Whoa, that's enough.

No more than that. The name of that person is not something to be spoken lightly.

<b>

0256: Anonymous Strongest

Ah, SR, huh.

<b>

0257: Anonymous Strongest

SR is a god. A paper god, though.

<b>

0259: Anonymous Strongest

The name came out immediately, huh? I mean, every time a strongest thread is created, it ends with "Well, it's SR, right?" Do something about that! It's pointless to talk about players who have already retired.

<b>

0263: Anonymous Strongest

At one point, they were suspected of cheating for so long… if the top-ranked players hadn't acknowledged it as pure skill, no one would have believed it.

It's understandable to be suspected since they soloed Venom before weapon skills were implemented.

<b>

0265: Anonymous Strongest

They're insane, right? (Compliment)

<b>

0266: Anonymous Strongest

They're crazy, right? (Compliment)

Excuse me, I'm a newbie who started three months ago.

That SR person? Were they really that strong? Stronger than Crescent from "Tsuki"?

<b>

0269: Anonymous Strongest

Welcome to Tempest, newbie!

If you want to know about SR, feel free to ask anything.

<b>

0270: Anonymous Strongest

Are you a fan of SR? lol

<b>

0271: Anonymous Strongest

I am a fan, what about it?

<b>

0272: Anonymous Strongest

I'm a fan too, you know?

<b>

0273: Anonymous Strongest

I mean, is there anyone in this thread who doesn't like SR? lol There were often people saying they wanted to defeat SR, though.

<b>

0274: Anonymous Strongest

Um, so, about SR…

<b>

0278: Anonymous Strongest

Sorry to keep you waiting! And thank you for asking.

SR refers to the strongest player in Tempest who retired two years ago.

A solo player who dislikes camaraderie, unbeatable in individual matches. They would jump into party ranking battles and, despite being solo, would rank in the top ten.

<b>

0279: Anonymous Strongest

An idiot, huh? lol Well, that's not wrong. lol

Their evasion ability was on another level. If you're curious, try searching "SR evasion." You'll find tons of videos.

<b>

0292: Anonymous Strongest

I'm searching and watching it now… huh? They didn't get hit by the enemy's attack with this?

<b>

0294: Anonymous Strongest

They barely avoided it. The current number one, Crescent, said, "You can't hit them unless you surround them with multiple people and guide their movements." Their evasion ability is truly on a different dimension.

<b>

0295: Anonymous Strongest

Is this a thread to worship SR?

<b>

0298: Anonymous Strongest

You could say that, lol

<b>

0299: Anonymous Strongest

Even if a player stronger than Crescent comes out, it seems like it would still end up being "Well, they probably can't beat SR."

<b>

0304: Anonymous Strongest

That person is in the hall of fame, so it can't be helped. I still rewatch their videos.

<b>

0306: Anonymous Strongest

Same here. Watching the videos and trying to imitate them until I die is the template.

<b>

0307: Anonymous Strongest

Are you me? lol

<b>

0308: Anonymous Strongest

It's a path everyone takes… so newbie, give it a try.

<b>

0310: Anonymous Strongest

Aren't you indirectly telling me to "die"!?
