# A-48 Request Details

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Then, may I make a request from the Kingdom of Palmour to ASR?"

<b>

Suddenly, and with a cheerful expression, His Majesty said this, and I sensed a somewhat troublesome atmosphere as I replied, "What do you mean?" There's no way I could easily answer without knowing the content.

<b>

However, I could somewhat predict the flow of the conversation.

<b>

What His Majesty had said before, "Even if someone from the party is missing," means that he wants to add someone to ASR, which has reached its maximum number of participants.

And that prediction was correct.

<b>

"I do not intend to impose on you, who boasts an unparalleled strength, nor do I think I can—if possible, could you take Neska, the leader of our country's international martial arts tournament party 'Crimson Blade,' and my son Niz to an S-rank dungeon? Of course, I will prepare proper compensation."

<b>

"Eh, what!? The prince!?"

<b>

I had heard a little about Neska from Shin. Apparently, she had praised me regarding the martial arts tournament matches.

Since she represents the country, quite some time has passed since the secondary jobs became widespread. She should have conquered at least a B-rank dungeon, if not an A-rank dungeon.

<b>

But why the prince!? If something happens, it would definitely be a big deal! No, Pheno is also a princess, though!

<b>

Looking at Prince Niz, who was visibly shaken, he was surprisingly wider-eyed than I was.

<b>

"Why me!? I've never even been to a B-rank dungeon yet!?"

<b>

It seems this was also news to him. This young man is constantly being tossed around by his parents. How unfortunate.

As I watched Niz, who appeared to be more shaken than I was, I found myself calming down. I decided to observe the family's exchange while pondering various things in my mind.

<b>

"As royalty, you should be aware of the level of threats in your own country."

<b>

"Then shouldn't Father go instead?"

<b>

"Rather than having the elderly me or Ceres accompany you, it should be Niz, the next king, who goes. By seeing for himself the level of difficulty, he will be able to avoid making unreasonable requests of the explorers."

<b>

"That may be true, but... no, it is indeed something that should be seen."

<b>

After a brief internal struggle, Niz convinced himself and turned back to us at ASR.

<b>

"I apologize, but I am just a weakling who has only leveled up while being protected. I have held a sword at a novice level, but to be frank, I am nowhere near the level of the explorers. Moreover, since I have not even conquered a B-rank dungeon, I must proceed through the dungeons in order to reach the S-rank dungeon. Even so, is it possible to ask for your help...?"

<b>

Saying this, he bowed his head with a sincerity that did not seem fitting for someone of royal status. While he did not bend at a full 90 degrees, I could certainly feel his feelings reaching my companions, including myself.

<b>

"Please raise your head, Niz. There may be rumors circulating in this country, but I have experience conquering an S-rank dungeon alone. However, since it will be necessary to provide you and... was it Neska? with protection, it would indeed be troublesome—difficult to take three people, but two should be fine."

<b>

After responding to Niz, I turned to the people sitting next to me and asked, "Is it okay if we take this on?"

<b>

"If SR is fine with it, then I am too. Leave the protection to me."

<b>

"I want to go too!"

<b>

"Me too, me too! If I'm left behind, I'll be bored!"

<b>

"Um, I would also like to join!"

<b>

Sera, Pheno, Noah, and Shiri. Everyone was expressing their willingness to participate, which was appreciated, but there are only two spots available. Well, if I change the members for each dungeon, it might minimize complaints...

<b>

"Well, that's something to discuss... For now, let's finish the B-rank dungeon today, and tomorrow we can include Neska and go to the A-rank, then the day after tomorrow to the S-rank. ...Ah, how does that fit with your schedule?"

<b>

Realizing I was trying to set a schedule based on our own convenience, I hurriedly asked His Majesty. He looked at us with interest, nodded several times, and then spoke.

<b>

"Indeed. I had originally arranged for there to be no plans for a few days for your sake. I hadn't discussed it with Neska, but it should be fine—however, to think that not a single person is afraid to challenge the highest difficulty dungeon, where one could lose their life... I can feel the difference in levels."

<b>

"Hahaha..."

<b>

In terms of the total levels of each profession, there is indeed a huge gap between me and the inhabitants of this country. I can only manage a forced smile. I wonder if they would faint just from seeing my level of 100?

<b>

Ah, speaking of which—,

<b>

"I have one request; if possible, I would like to have the obligation to show our status removed when we enter the dungeon. Even if we disguise ourselves in the city, it would be troublesome if we were found out at the reception."

<b>

Since we have the chance, I also want to help raise the levels of the other members. My profession, Overlord, is known worldwide, but if I were to show something like "Demon King Level 68" at that time, it would definitely cause a commotion. In this world, it is still said that only the Lightning Trail has confirmed a third job.

<b>

"Understood. I will also write a note, but... could you at least show your face to the guild master in the royal capital? I will prepare a letter addressed to Neska, so please hand it over together."

<b>

In response to His Majesty's words, I nodded firmly.

<b>

"Understood. Then let's head to the guild first and then go to the B-rank dungeon."

<b>

"I would also like to hurry and start preparing."

<b>

Niz said this, bowed, and then exited the room.

<b>

Now then, since the B-rank dungeon should be finished quickly, shall we all go sightseeing in the city afterward?
