# 106 Wind Hole

～Rikudou Shuui Side～

<b>

<b>

Unexpectedly, I received a death sentence from the Creator God, and I was literally at a loss for words.

<b>

Well, that's to be expected.

<b>

I thought it was completely someone else's problem since I had heard that my other half was in trouble, but suddenly the focus turned 180 degrees, which was unexpected. This is a huge personal matter.

<b>

"Although you seem to be thinking about various things, in any case, Rikudou Shuui, a resident of Earth, must die once. If you were to disappear entirely like the inhabitants of that world, it would be difficult to adjust in the populous Earth."

<b>

"Ah... So that means I need to die anyway."

<b>

I would have preferred a death like euthanasia, but it seems that won't go so smoothly. I have no lingering attachments to Earth, and if I can go to another world, I can endure some pain.

<b>

... Huh? But what will happen to my corpse?

<b>

"Your corpse will be sent back to Earth. Your soul will merge with the current SR's."

<b>

"Seriously...?"

<b>

The soul will probably end up mixing my memories with SR's memories. I hope that one side's consciousness doesn't just disappear. For both of our sakes.

When I tried to confirm just in case, the Creator God answered, "That's correct," before I could even ask.

<b>

In that case, the problem is the corpse. Well, for me personally, it's not really a problem.

<b>

"What if a mangled corpse suddenly appears in my house? Wouldn't that be bad? Wouldn't an innocent person be accused of being a criminal?"

<b>

Like the neighbors.

Even though they have nothing to do with it, it would be sad if they were suspected. It would be even more regrettable if it caused a stink.

<b>

"We will skillfully make it a case that goes unsolved. There may be some costs for the investigation, but money will be properly circulated. So you should just switch places with SR without worrying about anything."

<b>

It feels like the Creator God preemptively answered what I was thinking.

It's good not to have worries, but dying is still scary. I can't help but want to stray off-topic.

<b>

"Can't I talk to my other half—SR?"

<b>

I thought it might be interesting to talk to myself, so I asked. But,

<b>

"That's difficult. You and SR won't physically move; instead, you will switch places. If there's something you want to say, I can convey it for you."

<b>

"Is that true? Then, let me see..."

<b>

If I write a long message, my strongest feelings towards SR probably won't get across, and more importantly, it's a hassle to think about. What does it even mean to send a message to myself? It's confusing.

<b>

"Just one word is enough to convey."

<b>

To the one who will die in my place, make sure to express your gratitude, SR. I'll be there soon.

<b>

Ah, another world... I'm really looking forward to it.

～SR Side～

<b>

<b>

The seven legs of Venom.

By destroying all of them, I can remove the barrier protecting the main eye. Only then can I finally attack the main body—meaning that as long as I haven't destroyed all the meat legs, I have no means to deal with any suspicious movements from this eye.

<b>

"It has a really bad vibe."

<b>

I've been destroying Venom's legs at a pace of about one per hour, and I'm currently working on the fifth one.

<b>

So far, I've taken zero damage.

<b>

It's a perfect display of my evasion specialization, but Venom's movements are slower than when I was playing the game. It's like playing a game that I had done thousands of times on hard mode now on easy mode, so it would be embarrassing to get hit. Therefore, there are currently no issues regarding the Venom hunt.

<b>

There are no problems, but,

<b>

"Why is it shrinking?"

<b>

In between attacks, I glance at the main body.

Initially, it was a sphere about 5 meters in diameter, but now it has shrunk to about 3 meters. The joints of the meat legs have become unnaturally thin to match the main body.

<b>

Could it be that it's losing power and weakening?—I thought, but according to Noah, it seems that the total power of the main body hasn't changed. She seems to be considering various possibilities, but she hasn't reached a clear answer.

<b>

"It's creepy."

<b>

I mutter that and lightly jump back.

A tentacle shot out from the side like a bullet and passed by my nose. Then, a magic spell with the force of a flamethrower was unleashed from the front, so I crouched and advanced, slashing at the part still under the effect of White Radiance.

<b>

Venom's movements remain sluggish.

<b>

I had intended to risk my life in the battle against Venom, but if it ends like this, it would be too anticlimactic.

Of course, compared to the boss of an S-rank dungeon, this thing is incomparably strong, but I had imagined a much more ferocious Venom. It's a letdown.

<b>

I can save my friends and the world, so isn't that enough?—I think that, but at the same time, I feel that it's boring, and both thoughts are mixing in my head.

<b>

"Focus only on defeating it now. Don't let your guard down."

<b>

Noah's voice of encouragement echoes. Yes, I'm really sorry about that.

As Noah said, this isn't the time to mess around. If it were just my own life at stake, that would be fine, but right now, I'm carrying countless lives on my shoulders. I don't feel much of a reality, but bearing the fate of the world means just that.

<b>

I can't afford to lose.

<b>

I thought that over and over again. That's why—,

<b>

After destroying Venom's seventh leg, just a few seconds later, I wanted to punch myself for thinking it was "boring."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

"I don't know what it will do. Right now, Venom's power is condensed to its limit."

<b>

Once the barrier was completely removed, Noah spoke to me with a tense expression. I replied with "Understood," but to be honest, I didn't quite understand the content of her words. Most of my consciousness was focused on the now softball-sized Venom.

There was nothing left to protect the main body, and it was floating about 20 meters away at my eye level.

<b>

If it were the Venom from the game, it would use gravity magic, petrification magic, and all sorts of spells right from the start. That alone would still be manageable, but it would even use a nonsensical magic called "illusion magic with a physical entity."

Isn't that no longer an illusion? It wasn't just me who thought that; almost all players felt the same way.

When I first saw Venom split into two, I thought, "Isn't that impossible?" but somehow it was manageable.

<b>

Yes, it was manageable.

<b>

It was manageable, so that's why I'm here now.

<b>

"Now, I wonder how it has changed."

<b>

It can't just be a change in appearance.

Since even Noah doesn't know, there must be some significance to this change.

<b>

The enemy's gaze is directed straight at me. Although it has shrunk considerably compared to its original size, it is still large for an eye. It still has that creepy appearance.

<b>

As I thought that and kept an eye on Venom's movements, its eyelids slowly began to lower. It took a full second for the eyeball to be covered by flesh.

And then those eyelids immediately opened wide.

<b>

What is it doing...?

<b>

"What was that movement? Some kind of magic...?"

<b>

Suddenly, I felt an unfamiliar sense of discomfort—I felt a strange heat in my abdomen.

<b>

While keeping my gaze on Venom, I lowered my chin and bent my neck down. Then, while paying attention to the enemy, I took a step back and briefly checked my abdomen with my eyes.

Seeing the scene reflected in my vision, I momentarily forgot that I was in the middle of a battle.

<b>

It's red.

<b>

My pitch-black clothing had a gaping hole, revealing my own blood and flesh inside.

<b>

A cavity the same size as Venom's eyeball had formed in my abdomen.

<b>

I can still recover with an elixir, but using an elixir means I can't use it for an hour...

In my current state, I'm not sure if I can recover without being wide open.

How long can SR hold on?
