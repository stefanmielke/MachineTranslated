# A-8 Raise Your Hands!

<b>

"This is an unpleasant way to be stared at."

<b>

As the time for the parade approached, the number of people walking in the castle town gradually increased. However, it was still easier to walk now than it was in the early morning when there were fewer people. The reason for this was obvious: the man in the white shirt slung over my back.

<b>

Due to a slight mishap, he was tied up in a rather indecent manner, but Serah and the others recognized it as a 'mysterious way of binding,' so for now, it was safe.

Only Noah, grinning, said, "You really know how to tie someone up like that," so I brought down a strong hand chop on him.

<b>

"Wouldn't it have been better to put him in a sack or something?"

<b>

While glancing at the man groaning with the rope in his mouth, Serah said.

<b>

"I don't have a big enough bag for him to fit in... and besides, we'll be arriving soon anyway."

<b>

It had been about fifteen minutes since we captured this man in the white shirt.

We had been walking through the city, relying on Noah's mind-reading abilities to head toward the thieves' hideout, and even in that short time, we had captured over ten pickpockets. That's just too many.

<b>

It seemed that the knights had been informed by Mr. Riles that we were assisting with security, so the handover of the thieves went smoothly, but everyone looked puzzled.

<b>

And rightly so.

<b>

After all, the job we had been asked to do by Mr. Riles was to settle fights occurring in the city.

If Mr. Riles were to find us now, things could get complicated, so I wanted to finish everything before we were spotted.

<b>

"...This seems to be the place. Everyone inside is definitely involved. It seems there are many in the basement."

<b>

"There's a basement, huh..."

<b>

The place we arrived at was an entirely ordinary inn.

Moreover, it wasn't a completely unfamiliar place; it was the inn that Noah and I had visited just a few days ago. At that time, we had to stay at a different inn because the rooms were full, but I never expected it to be the hideout of a thieves' group.

<b>

The thief who guided us here was handed over to the knights who were patrolling in pairs on the street. Once we knew the location, he was no longer needed.

<b>

"Didn't you notice it when we came here before, Noah?"

<b>

"I would have gone crazy if I had picked up all the surrounding voices... Sorry for not noticing."

<b>

Noah replied, looking down like a scolded child.

Seeing that appearance, which was hard to believe belonged to a former administrator, I sighed and brought my hand down lightly on Noah's head. Lighter than when I was teased about the way I tied up the thief earlier.

<b>

"I didn't say that to criticize you, you idiot. Besides, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't have found this place so quickly. You've done enough work—so just leave the rest to us."

<b>

I tried to look a bit cool in front of the goddess who looked like a little girl.

<b>

After exchanging glances with Serah, Fenon, and Shiri in order, they nodded confidently.

Considering Serah and the others' abilities, they could easily wipe out this group even without me. If the opponents were capable, they wouldn't be pickpockets but would quietly delve into dungeons.

<b>

"I'll support the three of you from the back while keeping an eye out to ensure nothing slips through. So you all can go wild."

<b>

"Understood," "Got it!" "Yes!"

<b>

When I encouraged them, I received three energetic replies.

I felt a bit sorry for their enthusiasm, but I was a little worried they might end up killing the opponents... Well, we still had plenty of elixirs, and if it came to that, I could just bill the criminals for the usage.

<b>

<b>

"Everyone, drop your weapons and raise your hands!"

<b>

Kicking the inn's door open, I uttered the line I had admired from dramas and movies many times.

<b>

However, the receptionist behind the counter, who looked bewildered, and the two men drinking at a corner table were holding not knives or blunt weapons, but mugs filled with alcohol. It was a very sad failure.

I mean, don't drink at the reception, old man.

<b>

"Weren't you supposed to leave it to Serah and the others?"

<b>

"Well, yeah... but I acted on curiosity, and this is what happened."

<b>

"We're taking down a thieves' hideout, you know? I think it's quite a serious job... You still see it as a game, don't you?"

<b>

"Is that so? I can't really tell, but maybe the low difficulty is making it feel less tense."

<b>

And so on.

<b>

While we were leisurely chatting, pretending to be fake siblings, Serah and the other three quickly incapacitated the men, binding them face down with ropes. They were fast at their jobs.

Serah had been active as an explorer for a long time, so it wasn't surprising she was used to rough situations. I was watching Fenon and Shiri, and they were both taking down the men effortlessly with magic and knee strikes. It seemed they were managing to hold back, so it didn't look like anyone's insides would burst.

<b>

"Oops... I should have left at least one of them conscious."

<b>

Serah said with a tone that suggested she felt she had messed up.

At her feet lay the shopkeeper, whose face was slightly dented and eyes rolled back. My condolences.

<b>

"Don't worry. I can generally sense where the others are, and you can too, right?"

<b>

"Well... since they aren't directing any malice toward me, I can't tell for sure."

<b>

If I could sense them, it would no longer be 'presence detection' but more like a 'searching' skill.

<b>

That aside,

<b>

"After all this commotion, the ones inside must have noticed by now. They'll either try to escape or fight back—so Noah will keep watch outside, and I'll make sure they don't escape from the inside."

<b>

"Understood! So we just need to subdue the criminals without killing them, right?"

<b>

"Y-yeah. I think Fenon and the others will be fine, but be careful."

<b>

"Thank you! Just those words give me a hundred times more energy! No matter how many opponents there are, I will take them down!"

<b>

Fenon struck a triumphant pose, looking full of determination. But remember, you can't actually take them down, okay?

<b>

"I'll do my best too! If I can defeat the most enemies, um, you can pat my head!"

<b>

"That's a great idea, Serah! Let's do that!"

<b>

Before I could even voice my opinion, the women were excitedly getting into it. Shiri casually chimed in with, "I won't lose either."

<b>

As I watched their exchange, I called out to Noah, who was starting to walk outside the building.

<b>

"Aren't Serah and the others more in a game-like mindset than I am?"

<b>

"Hahaha, that's because you feel secure knowing you're watching over them."

<b>

"Ah... I see?"

<b>

I couldn't quite agree or disagree... Well, as long as they were smiling, I guess it was fine.

<b>

Only Noah looked a bit dissatisfied, but... there's no way the former goddess wanted me to pat her head, right? Surely not.

<b>

For now, I'll keep an eye out to ensure that no one dies, regardless of friend or foe.
