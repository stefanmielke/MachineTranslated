# A-130 Purchase of the Dungeon House

<b>

<b>

<b>

The reason why Sera, Fenon, and Shiri were struggling despite being on the verge of death was that they wanted to quickly avoid becoming a burden to me and Crescent.

<b>

I said it was fine to relax with them, but it seemed that I appeared to be in high spirits from the outside, and they didn't want to hinder that.

<b>

"Well, we can meet at home every day anyway. We'll get stronger in our own way. Besides, once twenty-four hours pass after our defeat in that dungeon, the battles will start again—so let's make sure to recharge our spirits until then."

<b>

Sera smiled while clenching her fist tightly.

Fenon and Shiri also cheerfully smiled, saying things like, "Our levels are going up rapidly, so we should catch up soon," and "I can feel the distance closing, so I can keep pushing myself."

<b>

However,

<b>

"Eh? I didn't say anything about twenty-four hours, did I? You want to get stronger, right? Come on, it's already past nine in the morning, so let's go quickly. —Where, you ask? Of course, it's the S-rank dungeon. There's no way someone who wants to fight alongside big brother would say they're going to an A-rank dungeon, right?"

<b>

Noah, who appeared out of nowhere, said this, and all three of them made strained faces.

<b>

However, it seemed that Sera, Fenon, and Shiri were not opposed to it. They were physically struggling, but their spirits were not defeated.

<b>

If they level up in the S-rank dungeon and the dungeon prepared by Lady Idea, they should be able to quickly obtain the status bonuses for secondary and derived secondary jobs.

<b>

And if they level up their third jobs in that state, they would already be at a level where they could fight sufficiently.

I think I should investigate various things so that I can guide them to the house inside the dungeon for a breather. In any case, my interest lies in that residence, so I would end up researching it anyway.

<b>

The day after collecting coins in the cave, in the afternoon.

Crescent and Jade came to the house, and we headed together to Lady Idea's dungeon.

<b>

"Today we're buying a house, right? Have you decided which one you want?"

<b>

"There were a total of forty-nine houses, right? By the way, are there price differences?"

<b>

"We need to check that too. Last time, I only took a quick look."

<b>

As the three of us talked like that, we walked towards the area where the residential houses were located. We encountered monsters a few times before reaching the houses, but since they weren't boss monsters, we just defeated them. There was no excitement like the first time; it was just a routine task.

<b>

They were stronger than S-rank mobs, but they posed no threat to us. The S-rank boss and the boss of this dungeon could both be defeated solo by the three of us.

<b>

"Well then... let's split up for now and investigate the prices."

<b>

From a quick glance, all the houses were single-family sizes, a bit larger than typical homes seen in Japan. However, they weren't so large as to be mansions; they seemed suitable for four to five people to live comfortably.

<b>

Perhaps Lady Idea designed them with parties in mind.

<b>

"Then I'll start from the far end!"

<b>

"Then I'll start from this side."

<b>

It might be enough to check just ten houses, but I still feel the need to confirm everything properly.

<b>

Ninety-nine percent of the houses are probably available for five coins, but I can't be certain. Some houses might have special features, like automatic recovery. The possibilities are exciting!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…Well, there's nothing."

<b>

"I had a feeling by the third house."

<b>

I checked each of the forty-nine houses, but they all ended up being the same price. There was no hint of any special features, and I felt a bit disappointed.

<b>

That said, the fact that this residential area exists safely means it's likely an area where monsters don't approach, just like near the entrance of the dungeon. Just having a place to stay is already quite meaningful.

<b>

"Did you two find any houses you liked? I didn't particularly find anything I liked."

<b>

"Well, I didn't either. I put my preferences into the house built near Renas."

<b>

"Same here."

<b>

"Then let's take the house in the center. The house on the corner is attractive too, but it's probably the least likely to be attacked by monsters if they ever come."

<b>

"That's fitting for a king! After all, the royal castle in the royal capital is usually located in the center too."

<b>

"I don't really intend to be like that... I mean, I'm not really king material."

<b>

"But Esuar-san is a conqueror, right?"

<b>

That's just a job title. Besides, if we're talking about titles, Jade's current job is also Demon King, so aren't we both kings?

Well, that's not important. I feel like I was teased by the two of them, but I decided to quickly pay the coins and buy the house.

<b>

In the center of the houses arranged in a seven-by-seven grid was a house painted in navy blue. Compared to the houses in this world, it felt a bit closer to modern times.

<b>

As I approached the house, a pale blue window appeared.

Previously, it only displayed the price, but now it also offered the option to purchase or not. By the way, since I was holding all the coins, it seemed that only I was presented with the choice.

<b>

"Alright, purchase~"

<b>

It's not like I'm making a once-in-a-lifetime purchase, so the payment is easygoing. If I want more later, I can just collect coins again.

<b>

To be honest, I would want to buy all the houses if I could.

<b>

But thinking about the future when someone else might come to this dungeon, I feel bad about doing that. Perhaps there are purchase limits or something?

<b>

"I'll be the first! —Fugya!?"

<b>

As soon as I made the purchase, Crescent charged into the house and crashed into an invisible wall. And in front of me, a window appeared saying, "Do you permit Crescent to enter?"

<b>

With tears in her eyes, Crescent looked at me as if pleading, so I sighed and touched the entry permission.
