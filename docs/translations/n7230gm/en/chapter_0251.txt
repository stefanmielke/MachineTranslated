# A-134 It's a secret

<b>

<b>

<b>

Alright, let's pretend we didn't see that!

I know that if I do something like this on my own, Regulus will complain about it. Today, I managed to defeat the boss and get one coin, which is a sufficient achievement.

<b>

"Well, but... it's not certain that this really connects to Palmour."

<b>

It certainly feels like there should be a kingdom of Palmour in this direction, and it's undoubtedly a hopeful speculation mixed with my desires. If I get scared and it turns out to be different, I'll regret thinking, 'What was my inner conflict back then!'

<b>

"J-just a quick peek..."

<b>

As if drawn in, I take one step, then another, closer to the cobblestone stage.

<b>

And it seems that monsters don't gather around this entrance, as there are no threats nearby. My gaze is solely focused on the building where the teleportation magic circle will activate, so if monsters had appeared, I might have been attacked.

<b>

To get onto the cobblestone stage, I climb a couple of steps. As I cautiously approach the center, the ground begins to glow faintly.

<b>

"Whoa!"

<b>

I quickly pull my foot back, and the teleportation magic circle slowly dims its light.

This area must be just like the entrance to Lindell.

<b>

In a normal dungeon, you need a license card to enter, and when exiting, you have to either use an emergency return or clear the dungeon.

<b>

And this new dungeon can only be accessed by those who have cleared S-rank dungeons, so no card is needed. As for returning, since there is no setting for clearing, you can return to the original world by using emergency return or coming back to this stage.

<b>

"By the way, I wonder where I'll return if I use the emergency return after entering here...? I guess it would set to the most recent entry and exit point."

<b>

Since it took me over two hours to get here, if a new return point is set here, I'll have to walk back to the entrance of Lindell...

<b>

I ponder while crossing my arms on the cobblestone.

What should I do? I want to try this teleportation magic circle. I really want to try it.

But considering various circumstances, my reason is telling me that I shouldn't use it.

<b>

"Well, whatever. If someone is around, I'll just ask them to keep it a secret."

<b>

This is the privilege of being an S-rank solo clear and the title of the Overlord. Power should be used for times like this!

<b>

With that in mind, I step forward. The teleportation magic circle starts to glow, and the scenery shifts with a click.

<b>

The cobblestone stage that serves as the entrance to the dungeon is exactly the same. There is no difference at all.

However, the scenery surrounding it is completely different. I see a city that includes a castle that looks somewhat familiar.

<b>

And around this cobblestone stage, I can see the figures of soldiers on guard.

<b>

"—E-Esar-sama!?"

<b>

One of them noticed my arrival and called out to me.

I dashed towards him like lightning—running to the edge of the stage and placing my index finger to my lips.

<b>

"Please! Keep this a secret! Oh, and just to confirm, this is definitely the new dungeon of Palmour, right?"

<b>

"Y-yes, but... a secret, you say?"

<b>

"That's right. It's top secret. I’ll get in trouble."

<b>

As I try to persuade the soldier, two more soldiers arrive—along with a girl I recognize.

<b>

"Long time no see, Esar-sama—but, what is this...?"

<b>

It's Neska. She is one of the only two people in this country—along with Prince Niz, who has the qualification to enter this dungeon. In terms of combat power, it might still be difficult for her.

<b>

"Um, I think the guild master over here has contacted you about this, but it's regarding the investigation of the newly emerged SS-rank dungeon's interior and whether it connects."

<b>

"But that discussion was only this morning, wasn't it? It takes about five days from Lindell to Palmour, right?"

<b>

"Yes. So, Neska, can you and the soldiers here pretend you haven't seen me?"

<b>

"…? W-what do you mean?"

<b>

"Anyway, please! Don't ask anything!"

<b>

Before they could pursue the matter further, I bowed my head with all my might.

I had messed up just a few hours after Regulus told me to "report in." If this continues, I will definitely be nagged.

<b>

"If it's you, Esar-sama, saying that... I understand. Everyone, listen! Esar-sama has said that he has not come here today. Report that there is no anomaly in the SS-rank dungeon. If the knight order asks anything, I will take responsibility."

<b>

Neska instantly switched from her submissive attitude towards me and conveyed that to the gathered guards. No, no, if anything is said, I will take responsibility. So please, keep it under wraps.

<b>

"Alright then, everyone, after I return to Lindell today, I will inform the guild master that 'we will investigate tomorrow.' Then, around noon tomorrow, I will come out from here with a nonchalant face, so everyone, please act surprised as if you are seeing this phenomenon for the first time. I will also act very surprised."

<b>

"Leave it to us—then, I will also pretend to investigate during that time while staying here. But returning tomorrow after going back today...? It’s a distance that takes five days one way, you know?"

<b>

"Please don't ask about that. I will explain in detail tomorrow."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

There are probably many things she is curious about, but Neska swallowed her words and agreed.

Alright, now I just need to return to Lindell, inform Regulus about the investigation, and gather everyone. I hope it doesn't get found out.
