# A-57 To Aldia

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Thank you for today!"

<b>

When Sera, Noah, and I arrived at the castle gate, Niz and Neska were already waiting. First, Neska bowed enthusiastically towards the three of us. Fenon and Siri, who are not present here, are staying behind for this exploration.

<b>

Unlike yesterday when I saw her at the general store, Neska is now fully equipped and seems to have lost her anxious demeanor. Well, she might have just been surprised by the sudden situation yesterday.

<b>

"I was planning to stop by the dungeons in this country as well, so you don't have to worry too much. ...I just wish Niz had come a bit later. As royalty, he should take his time more."

<b>

Putting Neska aside, I wish Niz would consider his status a bit more when coming to the meeting place. It makes me feel bad to be the last one, even though we weren't late.

<b>

Hearing my words, Niz smiled awkwardly.

<b>

"To be honest, I'm unsure how to regard your title of 'Overlord'—and what rank someone with that profession should hold. It can't be on the same level as the previous titles."

<b>

"I see... So, are ordinary titles treated the same in every country?"

<b>

"It's not completely uniform, but it's generally similar. The conditions for granting them are standardized between nations."

<b>

"I understand."

<b>

Since ordinary titles are equivalent to a count, the title of Overlord must hold a higher authority. What comes above a count? A marquis or a duke, perhaps? I'm not sure.

<b>

<b>

We are heading to the city of Aldia, which is considered medium-sized within the Palmour Kingdom. This city is located about three hours by carriage from the royal capital.

Among the several A-rank dungeons in this country, there is one that can be reached in about an hour, but there are no S-rank dungeons nearby.

Thus, we are aiming for Aldia, which is conveniently located for both A-rank and S-rank dungeons.

<b>

"Since we're at it, feel free to enter the dungeon with a profession you want to level up. I'll do the same."

<b>

After saying this to the four of us in the carriage, I operated the window to set my profession to Saint.

The Saint has lower firepower compared to the other three advanced classes, but can use the body enhancement skills of the Sage and can handle things normally with the White Lotus. In a ranking battle of Tempest, I wouldn't have the luxury to say such things, but there are no issues in A-rank or S-rank dungeons.

<b>

Upon hearing my words, two of the four began to operate their windows without any doubt.

However, the two who had just met me seemed a bit hesitant.

<b>

"Um, I want to choose a derived secondary profession that hasn't leveled up yet, but is that really okay?"

<b>

"That's fine."

<b>

I've gotten used to the dungeons in this world by now.

When I first came here in a physical body, I was confused and not accustomed to it yet. However, after fighting daily, one inevitably gets used to it.

<b>

"Then I'll go with Demon Lord."

<b>

"I'll choose Sword Saint. I want to level up to 100 quickly."

<b>

I agree with their opinions.

Noah has already acquired most of the status bonuses, so it doesn't matter much which profession he chooses.

Sera has gained at least the minimum status bonuses from all the lower classes and secondary professions, so it wouldn't be bad to master her strengths first.

<b>

Neska's eyes widened in surprise at the casual remarks from the two.

<b>

"Level 100!? Not 80 by mistake!?"

<b>

"That's surprising, right... But it seems to be true. I only learned about it yesterday when Esuar showed me the list of professions."

<b>

Now that I think about it, the people in this world didn't know the level cap yet. Even though the Lightning Trackers made their existence public, they haven't capped out. Oops, how careless.

Neska, hearing the prince's statement, turned her gaze towards me. Though her mouth didn't move, her expression seemed to say, "Really!?"

<b>

"Yes, the level cap for third professions is 100. Leveling all third professions to the maximum is quite a challenge, so I think it's better to decide on a direction to take."

<b>

If one wants to level up all professions, it would be wise to expect at least ten years.

Since this isn't a game, one can't push themselves too hard.

<b>

"I-I see... I'm still a bit overwhelmed, so please let me think it over slowly."

<b>

As Neska said this with a strained expression, I shifted my gaze and prompted, "Niz, you too."

<b>

"Well, I don't really plan to level up that much."

<b>

"Huh? Don't you want to become stronger for your homeland or something?"

<b>

"I'll do the minimum, but I can't neglect other things just to focus on that."

<b>

Ah... That does seem problematic.

Niz is the first prince, after all—though I'm not sure how the king is decided, he must be the next king, right? He probably needs to study various things.

<b>

Study... study, huh...

<b>

"What's wrong, Esuar? You look troubled."

<b>

Sera said this, peering at my face with concern.

<b>

If I hadn't reincarnated in this world, I would have eventually found a good time to escape from being a NEET and started working again, leading to the boring studies. It's terrifying enough to make me grimace.

<b>

I'm truly glad to have reincarnated in this world.
