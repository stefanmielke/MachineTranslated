# 98 What Kind of Cause of Death is Good?

<b>

<b>

<b>

Fighting is fun.

<b>

When I was playing the game Tempest, a match that was just difficult enough to win was just right.

Whether it was against other players or monsters.

But now that the virtual has become real, I can't say such things.

<b>

A match where I don't know if I'll win or lose is only enough when fighting Venom.

In this world where resets aren't possible, I have no intention of willingly doing something so reckless. Dying from leveling up would just make me look foolish.

<b>

An opponent I can fight as usual, one I won't lose to. Yet, an opponent I need to concentrate on during the battle. That's the kind of enemy I'm looking for right now.

<b>

If I do that, I won't have to think about my comrades whom I can never meet again. Even if I could reunite with them, I wouldn't have to think about those who won't call my name.

<b>

So I pushed myself to the limit and continued to fight against the bosses of S-rank dungeons.

<b>

That said,

<b>

"I'm really tired now."

<b>

I muttered while watching the monsters disappear into particles.

<b>

Even though Noah should be recovering my stamina, I feel like my movements are becoming sluggish. There's no hindrance to my attacks or dodges, but I can't say I'm in top form. It seems that mental fatigue affects the body to some extent.

<b>

"I'm going to take a short break."

<b>

When I said that while looking back, Noah, who was floating in the air with her arms crossed, gave me a side-eye and let out a big sigh. Can't this brat at least say "Good job"?

<b>

"Esuar-kun, do you have any idea how long you've been fighting?"

<b>

"I don't know. There's no way to judge since there's no morning or night."

<b>

I put my weapon away in my inventory and walked towards the storage—no, the house. The background was still the same purple sky.

<b>

"Well, it feels like about three days."

<b>

"More than three times that has passed."

<b>

"...Seriously?"

<b>

"Seriously. I've been wondering when to step in to stop you. What on earth is going on with your mental structure?"

<b>

Noah said with an exasperated tone as she floated behind me.

If more than three times three days have passed... that means Noah has silently watched my battles for at least 200 hours. From my perspective, it's much weirder for Noah to just sit there and watch the fight. Ah, but since she's a god, I guess that makes her a strange god.

<b>

Even though this brat dragged me into chaos while I was peacefully living as a NEET on Earth, and even though she deliberately made me create comrades who were supposed to be erased—thinking "I'm sorry for leaving you alone for so long" makes me too kind, doesn't it?

<b>

<b>

Upon entering the house, I found an unfamiliar wooden round table and two chairs set up. How well-prepared.

<b>

"Since you seem to like coffee, I'll prepare some if you want to take a break. Or would you rather sleep in bed for a bit?"

<b>

"I'll sleep."

<b>

I replied shortly and dove backward onto the bed without even changing clothes.

Even though only about ten days have passed, it felt surprisingly nostalgic.

<b>

I intended to respond to Noah in a curt manner, but she didn't seem to be offended by my attitude; rather, she smiled with a relieved expression.

<b>

"Good night, Esuar-kun. Please rest well."

<b>

After saying that in a gentle voice, Noah snapped her fingers.

I had no choice but to fall asleep immediately, with no time to respond.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I didn't want to see that ceiling."

<b>

When I woke up, the first thing I thought was, "I wish it had all been a dream."

<b>

Phenon, Shiri, the trails of thunder, and Sera. Everyone was normally around me, diving into dungeons as usual, laughing, and sometimes getting a little grumpy—and I never imagined that such ordinary days could crumble so easily.

<b>

No, I didn't even expect to be reborn in a game world.

<b>

............ Huh?

<b>

Now that I think about it, I haven't really been reborn, have I? I haven't died. But since my body is different—it's not like I was transferred to a dungeon.

<b>

I wondered what had happened to me on Earth and turned my body sideways while lying down. As expected, Noah was there. She was sitting in a chair, arms crossed, with her eyes closed.

<b>

"Hey, Noah."

<b>

When I called out to her, she opened her eyes instantly and smiled.

If she had looked more like a villain, I could have directed my anger straight at her—how many times have I thought that? Good grief.

<b>

"Good morning. Were you able to rest your mind a little?"

<b>

"Well, somewhat. I have a few questions I want to ask."

<b>

"Feel free to ask anything. But since it's a rare opportunity, why not sit over here?"

<b>

As she said that, Noah snapped her fingers with a practiced motion. Instantly, a pure white coffee cup and saucer appeared on the table. The steam rising from the cup wafted between us.

As I stood up from the bed, coffee was poured into the cup. The aroma tickling my nostrils was elegant, and I could easily predict it would taste good even without drinking it.

<b>

I sat down in the chair and took a sip.

It's delicious.

<b>

"I'm glad you like it."

<b>

"Don't just read people's minds without permission."

<b>

I grumbled, but I took another sip of coffee.

I thought it might be strange to relax in such a situation, but after ten days of fighting, I realized that without this kind of leisurely time, I would probably go crazy.

<b>

"Now, shall I answer your question? You're wondering what happened to you on Earth, right?"

<b>

I haven't even uttered a single question yet... but I guess I'll stop pointing that out. It's a hassle.

<b>

"Well, yes. Did I disappear like Sera and the others? Am I considered dead?"

<b>

It's a fortunate turn of events... I wouldn't be causing anyone trouble if I disappeared since I had become a NEET after losing my family. But if I were dead, it would likely inconvenience a fair number of people, like the first discoverer or the funeral home.

<b>

"It's complicated, but to put it simply, you're alive on Earth."

<b>

I received an answer that wasn't even in my mental options.

No, no! That's strange!!

<b>

"So what does that mean!? Am I in a state of existing in two places at once!?"

<b>

"That's how it is. Well, this is also a kind of insurance for when you lose to Venom."

<b>

"I don't understand! Explain it in a way I can comprehend!"

<b>

My life or death on Earth isn't necessary information for defeating Venom, but I can't help but be curious. Are you trying to say I'm a copy human!?

<b>

"You're not a copy. The you here is constructed from half of the soul that Rokudo Shuui possessed—put simply, half of your lifespan. So even if you lose to Venom and die, you can still live a little on Earth. However, your lifespan will decrease at that time, and there's nothing that can be done about that."

<b>

This brat knows my real name as if it's the most natural thing in the world. There’s no one else asking, so it’s fine, but still.

<b>

"So that means, my existence on Earth is currently in a state of time freeze? Or does it have a separate will and is still playing the game?"

<b>

"It's the former. This world and the world you were in... well, it might be easier to imagine them as parallel fuses. Despite the differences in speed, both worlds were progressing in the same direction. And when you chose 'reincarnation' in Tempest, the time axis of this world was warped by 90 degrees."

<b>

...Am I the idiot here? I don't quite understand.

Noah must have read my mind. She had a wry smile on her face.

<b>

"In other words, the lifespan of this world is condensed into a moment of your world."

<b>

................ Hmm.

I somehow feel like I understand.

<b>

In short, if I lose to Venom and die, my NEET life on Earth will resume. However, my lifespan at that time won't be long.

<b>

"You said I'm constructed from half of my lifespan, right? So does that mean I'll die early even if I defeat Venom?"

<b>

"With your current body, yes. If you defeat Venom and wish to live in this world, I will pull the remaining soul into this world. Only then will you die on Earth."

<b>

I could only grimace at Noah's ominous statement about letting me choose my cause of death freely.
