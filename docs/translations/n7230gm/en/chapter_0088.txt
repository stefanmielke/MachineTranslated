# 85 Promise

<b>

This is a story from Sera's perspective!

----------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

With a bang, the sound of the front door closing can be heard.

Esar, who said "I'm going," in a voice that seemed about to break into tears, left without stopping. It felt less like hesitation and more like he was trying to escape from me.

<b>

What he spoke of was something hard to believe.

<b>

He said that he had been adventuring in a dungeon with a childhood friend of mine, a maid who served her, and himself. Such memories do not exist within me.

<b>

Furthermore, it seems that I was trying to conquer a B-rank dungeon at the risk of my life for the sake of that friend.

Indeed, I was trying to conquer a B-rank dungeon to obtain an elixir, but that was solely out of a desire to save the princess as a citizen of this country. My memories and what he said are vastly different.

<b>

...What if what he said was true?

<b>

And if I were in Esar's position, imagining that a close person had disappeared while no one around noticed, and that no one understood when I spoke about it.

<b>

"It must be painful..."

<b>

Loneliness. It is far too lonely.

<b>

It doesn't matter how many people are around. He must be experiencing a considerable amount of mental solitude. Just thinking about how much pain that must cause makes me feel nauseous.

<b>

"The only thing I can do is... believe in Esar, I suppose."

<b>

He seems to be moving to save my friend.

From what he said before leaving the house, it is highly likely that he will conquer an A-rank dungeon fifty times, change to a third job class, and then head to an S-rank dungeon.

<b>

Whether that is the right action or a wrong one, I do not know.

But I want to help him. Something within me is urging me not to let him be alone.

<b>

As I pondered this, a girl with very beautiful, pure white hair appeared in my mind—someone with a blank face said.

<b>

"Make sure to support the hero."

<b>

Could this girl be the person named Fenon that Esar mentioned? It might just be my imagination.

<b>

"What should I do...?"

<b>

I want to help him, but it's clear that my power would only be a hindrance to him. I have learned that painfully through my daily dungeon life.

<b>

Yet if I were to dive into a high-difficulty dungeon alone and try to level up in a dangerous way, I would be breaking my "promise" with him—promise...?

<b>

"—Ah! That's right! I promised Esar! 'I won't do anything dangerous,' 'I won't betray you,' 'I will trust what he says!' Why did I forget such an important thing!?"

<b>

I clearly remembered now. He had told me to keep those three things if I wanted to become stronger, even though we were not on good terms at the time.

Perhaps it was because I was in such a dangerous state back then that he made that suggestion. I might have been in a situation where I would die if left alone.

That's right, that's right. I certainly felt that way back then.

<b>

However—,

<b>

"Even though I am a citizen of the Lindale Kingdom, why was I trying to do something so reckless...?"

<b>

Would I really risk my life to save the first princess?

...No, unless forced, I would not do such a thing. It may sound cold, but my own life is more important. Perhaps I would have done something reckless for the sake of a childhood friend, as Esar said.

<b>

My memories are indeed confused or shrouded in mist; it feels strange.

<b>

"—Hehe. So, it seems that Esar is indeed right."

<b>

Of course, I trusted Esar from the beginning! After all, I made a promise! Though I had forgotten.

What I was troubled about was merely trying to explore the validity of Esar's words from various perspectives, and I was not doubting him at all. It is different; it is different.

<b>

Who am I making excuses to...? Well, whatever.

<b>

It wasn't that Esar had gone crazy, but that our memories had been rewritten, and yet I felt strangely happy.

<b>

But,

<b>

"...I see. I will disappear."

<b>

If Esar's words are true, I will likely leave this world in the not-so-distant future, just like my friend named Fenon and the maid. I will be forgotten by everyone in the world and vanish like smoke.

<b>

"If Esar remembers me, that feels more than enough."

<b>

I lifted the corners of my mouth and slowly stood up.

I will go to meet the Thunderbolt Trail. And I will convey what he told me to them.

<b>

Surely, as Esar's disciples who have shared hardships together, they will think seriously about it.

I will do what I can while I still exist in this world.

<b>

Two days after Esar headed to the A-rank dungeon.

<b>

I successfully made contact with the Thunderbolt Trail in the royal capital. They seemed to have come to the royal capital to meet with His Majesty, so I was able to arrange a smooth conversation.

<b>

Having achieved the unprecedented feat of conquering an A-rank dungeon, the Thunderbolt Trail seemed to be in high demand from various places, but when I conveyed through the guild that "I have important news about Esar," they agreed to meet me immediately.

<b>

I think they were likely worried that they had not yet reported the conquest of the A-rank dungeon to their master, Esar. I would want to report to Esar first if I were in their position.

<b>

I borrowed a soundproof conference room from the guild and faced the three members of the Thunderbolt Trail.

<b>

"—That is the situation. Only Esar is aware of this abnormality."

<b>

I felt a twinge of anxiety, wondering if it was okay to speak freely like this, but I reassured myself that I hadn't been told to keep quiet, so it should be fine.

The three of them—Shin, Suzu, and Laika—stared blankly for a while after hearing my story.

<b>

"This doesn't feel like a joke... Is it for real?"

<b>

"Is it after conquering the A-rank dungeon? I feel like, as Sera said, there are a few more things I can't remember. It might just be my imagination, though."

<b>

Saying "You didn't forget, did you?" Shin muttered, and Laika smacked his head. A painful sound echoed.

<b>

To lighten the mood, Shin made a somewhat playful remark, but they were seriously considering my story without laughing it off or mocking me. Despite being an unbelievable story that could belong in a fairy tale—because they feel indebted to Esar, they are likely thinking about it this way.

Suzu even closed her eyes, crossed her arms, and furrowed her brow.

<b>

In my memory, the one who thinks the most clearly in such situations is this girl who looks like a priestess. Although, even if I call her a girl, Suzu is older than me.

<b>

Eventually, Suzu slowly opened her eyelids as if waking from a deep sleep. Then she spoke.

<b>

"I believe it has to do with him being a summoned human—a resident of another world. Something's power is affecting only this world, and we have had our memories rewritten. And since Esar is not influenced by that power, he remembers our previous selves—if we think that way, it makes sense."

<b>

"Was the trigger the conquest of the A-rank dungeon?"

<b>

"Timing-wise, that seems to fit best. Moreover, considering that six S-rank dungeons have appeared around Sera's home, I think that whoever changed this world is trying to make Esar conquer the dungeons. I can't think of any other explanation."

<b>

As Suzu said this in a calm tone, Shin let out a big sigh next to her.

<b>

"So, does that mean we will eventually disappear too... and we can't resist it..."

<b>

"When that time comes, it will come. Esar is working to restore this world, right? Then let's believe that our master will solve everything. He's strong, so it will be fine."

<b>

"He's ridiculously strong, after all."

<b>

Suzu and Laika chuckled.

From my perspective, their laughter seemed somewhat sad. Perhaps it was a feeling of having no choice but to laugh anymore?

<b>

Shin, who was in between those two, clapped his hands twice to regain control of the situation. All eyes turned to him.

<b>

"I understand your story. Now, let's think about what to do next, assuming that what Esar said is true."

<b>

"Right."

<b>

"Yes, yes."

<b>

Saying this, the three members of the Thunderbolt Trail laughed. I also couldn't help but smile, thinking, "It's been a while since I've seen a leader-like side of them."

The combative smiles that the Thunderbolt Trail wore somehow reminded me of my important person.
