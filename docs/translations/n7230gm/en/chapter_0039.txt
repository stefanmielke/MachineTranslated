# 37 Departure

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I think I'll leave the royal capital."

<b>

It's not that I want to train Sera for the martial arts tournament—I've always intended to do this. While it feels unsatisfactory to sneak away, there’s something I desperately want outside the royal capital.

<b>

Indeed, the royal capital has abundant dungeons and is a suitable city for leveling up, but that's only true when you're just starting as an explorer.

There are hardly any worthwhile drops, and there are no nearby A-rank dungeons.

<b>

Eventually, if the Thunderbolt Trail conquers an A-rank dungeon, an S-rank dungeon will emerge near the royal capital, but that’s a story for a little later.

<b>

Regulus-san responds to my statement with an apologetic tone.

<b>

"I was about to suggest the same. At least until the martial arts tournament, it would be better to spend time in a city where your faces are not known. Sera is somewhat recognized, but if her distinctive hair color changes in an unfamiliar city, she shouldn't be noticed."

<b>

According to Regulus-san, there is a magical tool that can change hair color.

In fact, Sera already possessed it.

It seems she used this magical tool when she didn't want to be mistaken for a noble. She took it out from her inventory and showed it to me, saying, "This is it."

<b>

At first glance, it looks like just a hair accessory, but when she attaches it to her hair, the color rapidly changes from deep crimson to dark brown. It dyes like paint dropped on water.

<b>

Back when I was playing games, I would think, "What value does this pebble have?" when obtaining magic stones, but in this world, they are used for such magical tools. It seems magic stones are also used in room lights and street lamps.

<b>

"However, about Fenon and the others—"

<b>

As I was about to say that, Sera snickered.

<b>

"They will definitely come. After all, it's Esuar who is going. If she changes her hair color and outfit, she shouldn't be recognized either. She was mostly in a dress when in public."

<b>

"...So she really is coming."

<b>

I don't feel bad about being liked, but the other party's status is a concern.

Just when I thought I was getting used to the noble Sera, now it's royalty—specifically, the first princess. I wonder if there will ever be a day when my heart can rest.

<b>

"It seems you are quite favored by Her Highness the Princess."

<b>

Regulus-san chuckles, as if it's someone else's business. What a carefree comment. I shrugged and replied, "It seems so."

<b>

"I'd like to talk to the Thunderbolt Trail, but could you send a message asking them to come to our house tomorrow morning?"

<b>

Since they are probably just going to the dungeon, they likely have no plans. Just a hunch.

If they had a date planned for the three of them, I would need to have Shin explode into tiny pieces.

<b>

"Sure. We were just planning to discuss the martial arts tournament tonight, so I'll let them know."

<b>

"Thank you."

<b>

Regulus-san also mentioned that it would be better not to stay in the royal capital until the martial arts tournament, and by then, the commotion over the title should have calmed down a bit.

During that time, I won't be able to give instructions to the Thunderbolt Trail, so I need to assign them some homework.

<b>

☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆

<b>

<b>

The next day, around 9 AM, the Thunderbolt Trail appeared.

<b>

By the way, I'm currently the only one in this house; Sera, Fenon-san, and Shiri-san are absent. It's a strange situation since it's my house.

<b>

They were supposed to come to this house after preparing for a month to go to another city.

<b>

Still, while Sera was free to move as an explorer, I wonder how Fenon-san managed to persuade the others. I can almost picture the bitter expressions on the faces of His Majesty and Lord Dino.

<b>

The departure is scheduled for noon, and it seems they will arrive at their destination before dark if they travel by carriage. I don't quite understand that, as I used to use horses that operated on a system. I can gauge the distance somewhat, though.

<b>

<b>

I set two teacups and two mugs on the table. The contents are tea and coffee, respectively, with the former for the women and the latter for the men.

<b>

Shin says "Thank you" and takes a sip from his mug.

Then he promptly gets to the main topic.

<b>

"So, you're leaving the royal capital?"

<b>

His tone is light, but his expression is serious. He probably heard about yesterday from Regulus-san.

<b>

"Yeah. The current royal capital feels uncomfortable."

<b>

"I heard that two explorers from elsewhere said something terrible, right? We'll make sure to take care of it, so don't worry."

<b>

Despite his appearance, Suz is using a rather intimidating expression when she says "take care of it." As expected of a member of the country's number one party. In a good way.

But that's unnecessary.

<b>

"It's fine; I don't even remember their faces clearly. I was irritated by the insults toward Sera, but after a night's sleep, my anger subsided. However, if they come at me again, I won't hold back."

<b>

At that time, I'll follow Regulus-san's example and suspend them in the air. Then toss them. I'll throw them against the wall.

<b>

"Oh dear, that explorer is unfortunate. Of all people, to be targeted by Esuar."

<b>

"What do you mean 'of all people'? I'm relatively mild-mannered, you know?"

<b>

"I mean, there's no chance of winning."

<b>

Hehe—Lika laughs as she says this. Well, I don't plan to lose to anyone.

<b>

"Anyway, I was planning to leave the royal capital. I had some drops I wanted."

<b>

"Drops you want?"

<b>

Shin asks with interest.

I don't mind telling them, but I want to surprise them since it's a special occasion.

<b>

"Do you know there's a B-rank dungeon near the city of Renus?"

<b>

My destination is the commercial city of Renus, located northeast of here. It's one of the largest cities in the country, competing for the top spots, even if it's not as big as the royal capital.

<b>

"Of course. However, that place has never been conquered before, and it's currently blocked by Duke Margus for safety reasons, right?"

<b>

...Huh? Blocked? What does that mean?

<b>

"I guess I have to persuade the duke somehow. If I show him the royal family's dagger or the bracelet of titles, it should work. If it comes to it, I'll force my way in."

<b>

"Hahaha—what happened to you being relatively mild-mannered?"

<b>

"When it comes to dungeons, it's a different story."

<b>

Because that's the reason for living in this world. Of course, I'd prefer not to do such things if possible.

<b>

"Is there something good among the drops from that dungeon?"

<b>

"Yeah. To me, it's even better than an elixir."

<b>

The difficulty of obtaining it is high, but it's worth the effort.

<b>

When I said that, the three of them sitting on the opposite sofa all made faces of concern.

<b>

"Take it easy, okay..."

<b>

"Is Esuar still carrying a bomb?"

<b>

"Why do you want drops from a dungeon that hasn't been conquered—no, never mind."

<b>

They said various things, but I have no intention of holding back. Eventually, it will become an indispensable item for this world.

<b>

Having it or not will greatly change my future as an explorer. The drops from the B-rank dungeon in Renus are that important.

<b>

"Well, you'll have to wait a month for that."

<b>

"I see—well, regarding the dungeon's blockade, it should be fine. After all, it's Duke Margus."

<b>

"That's right."

<b>

"Yes, yes."

<b>

At Shin's words, Suz and Lika nodded while grinning at me.

<b>

"What is it? Is that duke a kind person?"

<b>

"Who knows? That will be part of the fun of going there."

<b>

Hehe—Shin laughs cheerfully.

Is this payback for me keeping the drops a secret?

<b>

"Well, as long as it's okay, that's good."

<b>

I said that and paused the conversation to assign the homework, which was my original purpose. "This is about the time I'm away," I began.

<b>

"I mentioned before about conquering the B-rank dungeon with the three of you, right? If you can do that, while I'm away, Shin and Lika should level up to 50 as martial arts swordsmen, and Suz should level up to 50 as a sage. The leveling location will be the B-rank dungeon—you don't have to force yourselves to defeat the boss."

<b>

I want them to prepare for the next stage.

That said, what they will be doing is still leveling up.

<b>

"Leveling up to 50 for advanced jobs... Is that even possible in such a short time?"

<b>

Shin asks with a worried expression.

He probably doesn't say it's impossible because he has started to understand the benefits of experience points from high-rank dungeons.

<b>

"Yeah. If you level up in the B-rank dungeon."

<b>

"That's outrageous..."

<b>

"What was all our hard work for?"

<b>

Suz and Lika sighed in exasperation, speaking in low voices.

To the downcast trio, I responded in a bright voice.

<b>

"Your efforts won't go to waste. In the end, everyone's stats will be lined up side by side. Once that happens, combat skills will determine strength."

<b>

The women nodded with ambiguous expressions, as if they understood but didn't.

As for Shin, he looked somewhat dissatisfied.

<b>

"Level 80 is quite a stat for explorers, you know... Is it going to become the norm?"

<b>

A strong breath escaped from Shin's nose.

I see. He is worried that if leveling up continues at this pace, he will soon be caught up by other explorers.

<b>

But that concern is unnecessary.

<b>

"Don't worry, there are levels above 80. It's not that easy to reach the maximum level."

<b>

When I said that, they all stopped moving, their eyes wide open in surprise.
