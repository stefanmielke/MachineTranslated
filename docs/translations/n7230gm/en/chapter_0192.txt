# A-75 Crescent

<b>

<b>

It’s been a while since we visited a B-rank dungeon.

<b>

Rather than a dungeon raid, it feels more like a picnic. The other members are also progressing in acquiring player bonuses, and a single enemy attack shouldn’t be fatal.

<b>

Each of us has stats that could allow us to clear an A-rank dungeon on our own, and with five of us—it's excessive firepower to the point where the monsters might feel sorry for themselves.

We chatted and laughed while clearing the first and second floors of the dungeon, and without getting too tired, we broke through to the fifth floor.

<b>

“Should we take down the Cyclops with five of us? Or should SR handle it like last time?”

<b>

While waiting to teleport to the boss's location, we sat on the ground or leaned against the walls, discussing how to tackle the boss.

<b>

“No, no, that would be boring. I hate to say it myself, but it would be a total one-shot.”

<b>

When I said that, Shin clasped his hands behind his head and muttered, “Right?”

We continued to brainstorm until the last possible moment about who would challenge it and how to defeat it, but in the end, we ran out of time. There was no option to retreat, so I touched the screen to challenge the boss.

<b>

Surrounded by light, we teleported to the stage where the Cyclops was supposed to be—but then.

<b>

“I shall ensure you do not suffer injuries. Inhabitants of Noah's world, feel free to challenge my child from this world.”

<b>

As my vision turned completely white, I heard that voice.

Is that… Lady Idea? Not suffer injuries? My child from this world? What on earth does that mean?

<b>

As I stood there, stunned by the words that suddenly echoed directly in my mind, my vision began to clear. It was the boss room with the Cyclops I had seen many times before—but instead of the giant figure, a single human stood there.

<b>

The figure was clad in a military uniform adorned with gold on a white background, holding a sword that curved like a crescent moon.

<b>

“Did everyone hear that voice? It was definitely Lady Idea’s voice and way of speaking, right?”

<b>

“Y-yeah… I can’t shake this bad feeling.”

<b>

Following Suzu’s words, Shin grimaced and spoke.

<b>

“I’ve never seen armor or weapons like that—SR, do you know who it is?”

<b>

Sera asked me while observing the figure.

<b>

Do I know? Ah… of course I do. That silhouette, you all saw it in the arena too. It was completely black back then, but now that it’s a contrasting silver, they might not recognize her.

<b>

But I’m different. I’ve fought her countless times, and I have lost over and over again to the party she leads, enduring all sorts of humiliation. There’s no way I could forget.

<b>

Despite being a professional in many similar games, the individual ranking has been held by someone else since I stopped participating. And the party ranking remains firmly in first place. The leader of the explorer party “Moon”... Crescent.

<b>

“Oh! It’s really SR!”

<b>

When our eyes met, she waved her hands excitedly and approached. Her appearance was exactly like the character in the game—and her way of speaking was just like her.

<b>

“W-wait… what kind of joke is this…”

<b>

The closer she got, the more I realized she was the “real deal.” My social anxiety kicked in, and I unconsciously started to back away.

<b>

<b>

“Wow, I had an accident and died, you know? That guy who ran the red light is definitely going to hell. Oh, and then the god—was it Lady Idea? That person? That god? asked me if I wanted to come to this world, and I said yes right away because I heard SR was here!”

<b>

“Oh, I-I see. So, does that mean Crescent-san has also been reincarnated in this world like me?”

<b>

I was taken aback by Crescent’s rapid-fire speech. I hadn’t really communicated properly with her in the game, so I felt an overwhelming urge to leave immediately.

<b>

However, more than that, I was curious about her current situation.

<b>

“Yep! I was lightly told to fight some people from this world, so this is basically the mission given to me! SR, you soloed the Venom, right? You’re still doing crazy things!”

<b>

“Ahaha, well, it seems that way.”

<b>

“Only someone like SR could do that! You’re still treated like a legend! There are still plenty of people who doubt it’s not cheating because your player skills are just insane!”

<b>

As always, she keeps praising me… She’s been like this since the game days.

<b>

“Ah… that’s not wrong. I mean, there’s this god from this world—a brat named Noah who seems to have modified my eyes, so my reflexes are better than normal people. So without these eyes, I don’t know what my ranking would have been.”

<b>

As I spoke with a tinge of guilt, she looked momentarily stunned before bursting into laughter.

<b>

“—Hahaha! No way, that’s impossible! Sure, that’s cheating, but that’s just like a demon getting a club; humans can’t win against demons in the first place. And calling a god a brat is just impressive!”

<b>

Huh? Am I being excluded from being human again? I’m a person too, you know? Shin has treated me like a monster, but I’m still human!

<b>

Well, regardless… I said all that, but even without the title of Overlord, and even without these eyes, I have no intention of losing to Crescent.

<b>

“I feel like I want to clash with SR again after a long time, but for now, I’ll fulfill this god’s mission. I want to see the outside world instead of being stuck in such a gloomy place!”

<b>

As she said that, she turned her gaze away from me and looked towards Shin and the others.

Now that I think about it, that was the plan. I had completely forgotten.

<b>

Now then… I wonder how well Shin and the others can keep up with her.
