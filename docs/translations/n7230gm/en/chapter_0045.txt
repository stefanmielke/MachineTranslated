# 43 No Need for Counterattack

<b>

<b>

<b>

The four of us wandered around the city of Reinas, had lunch, and then strolled around the city again.

What was supposed to be just a way to kill time turned out to be an opportunity for Sera and me to bond with Shiri-san, and I must admit, Fenon-san, who had been holding my hand the whole time, seemed quite pleased.

<b>

In the royal capital, I hadn’t had the chance to leisurely explore the city, but walking around like this made me feel that the people in this world are indeed living their lives properly.

The city of Reinas is vast, and we couldn't cover everything, but we still had more than enough fun.

This cheerful atmosphere is something I rarely experienced back on Earth, making it very precious.

<b>

<b>

3 PM.

After visiting the guild, we were guided to the training ground located behind the building.

<b>

It’s about the size of two basketball courts, I guess? In any case, it’s larger than the building.

It seems that the area had been cleared of people beforehand, as there wasn’t a single explorer in sight in that spacious place.

<b>

The only ones present here now are Raileus-san, the receptionist who will act as the referee, and the four of us.

The receptionist, who acted at the window when I visited the guild and woke Raileus-san up, is holding what looks like a first aid kit.

I don’t intend to have a match that would cause injuries, but even saying that, I might lack a bit of convincing power right now.

<b>

“Is it alright to use swords? Though, that’s about all I have prepared.”

<b>

As he said this, Raileus-san handed me one of the two wooden swords he was holding.

When I had a mock battle with Sera before, I fought barehanded, but this time I’ll also fight with a sword to match Raileus-san. I accepted the sword and replied, “I’ll go with this.”

<b>

As I swung the sword to check its feel, Fenon-san called out to me from a short distance away, “Esuaar-sama!” Is it really okay for her to address me with “sama” in front of others? This person is truly free-spirited.

<b>

I walked over to where they were waiting.

Fenon-san said, “Do your best!” while holding my left hand, which wasn’t holding the sword, with both of hers.

<b>

“Thank you. I’ll do my best.”

<b>

Feeling shy, I scratched my head with my right hand that was holding the wooden sword. I might have picked up Shin’s habit.

<b>

“You’re using a sword, huh?”

<b>

It was Sera who spoke up.

She seemed to be thinking about something, intently staring at the sword that was swaying above my head.

<b>

“Yeah—Raileus-san said to overwhelm him. I thought I’d live up to that expectation.”

<b>

As I said this with a smirk, Fenon-san opened her mouth this time.

<b>

“I’m really looking forward to seeing Esuaar-sama in battle!”

<b>

“Ha ha, thank you. It’ll probably be boring, though.”

<b>

“No matter what kind of battle it is, it can’t possibly be boring! After all, it’s Esuaar-sama!”

<b>

Her trust level is off the charts. I feel like the expectations are too high.

<b>

“Please don’t overdo it. Raileus-san said he has reached the third level of a B-rank dungeon, so he’s one of the top fighters in this country.”

<b>

“Thank you, Shiri-san. But there’s no need to worry. I’ve gotten stronger too.”

<b>

“The thought of Esuaar being stronger than he was back then—makes me a bit scared to imagine.”

<b>

Sera said with a wry smile, making a gesture as if hugging herself jokingly.

<b>

“You’ll fight like you did against that Cyclops, right? The guild master of Reinas must be feeling sorry for himself.”

<b>

What she’s referring to is probably my combat style named “Total Counter,” where I counterattack against every attack.

<b>

But this time, it’s a bit different.

<b>

Raileus-san’s profession is a swordsman at level 80, just like Shin. Compared to me now, his stats are inferior.

What I mean is, there’s too much of a gap in strength between me and him right now.

<b>

<b>

While the stats are quite similar, I surpass him in AGI.

When I fought Sera, my stats were mostly in the G range. Back then, even if I landed an attack, it might have just resulted in a faint, but this time I can’t afford to deal such strong attacks. There’s a risk of causing serious injury.

<b>

However, I want to dominate in the match.

<b>

“I don’t think there will be a need for a counterattack.”

<b>

“What do you mean?”

<b>

“Well, just watch.”

<b>

With those last words, I distanced myself from them and approached Raileus-san, who was lightly swinging his sword.

<b>

“Sorry to keep you waiting.”

<b>

“Don’t worry about it. You all seem to get along well.”

<b>

“Yeah. We haven’t known each other for long, but they’ve been friendly.”

<b>

As for Fenon-san, she’s coming on strong, surpassing the meaning of “friendly.”

<b>

“Hmm… I heard you just arrived in this country, but have you been training somewhere?”

<b>

With a probing gaze, such words were thrown at me.

<b>

This person doesn’t know that I was summoned from another world. To them, I probably seem like an unknown person who just appeared out of nowhere. I understand the curiosity.

<b>

“That's a secret.”

<b>

Of course, I have no intention of revealing it casually.

<b>

In response to my answer, Raileus-san childishly said, “Aww,” and laughed.

He looks older than me when I was on Earth, but his mental age might not be very high.

<b>

With the receptionist in between us, Raileus-san and I took about ten meters of distance.

<b>

Once we confirmed that we both had our swords ready, she took a deep breath.

<b>

“Now, we will begin the mock battle. Any dangerous actions that could lead to serious injury are prohibited. Please stop if blood is drawn.”

<b>

“You don’t want to see blood, do you?”

<b>

“Quiet down over there!”

<b>

“………………”

<b>

Raileus-san… I guess he’s the type to be dominated, huh? Or is it just that she has a strong personality?

While watching their exchange with a wry smile, my body sensed that the time for battle was approaching. My knees naturally bent, entering a combat-ready stance.

<b>

“If I deem you to be unable to continue due to surrender, fainting, or any other reason, I will decide the outcome. Now—begin!”

<b>

With the signal, we both dashed forward to attack—except neither Raileus-san nor I did.

We stepped forward, closing the distance while stepping on the sand of the ground.

<b>

Hmm—he has quite a solid stance.

While he may not be as good as Shin, as Shiri-san said, he’s probably a decent fighter.

<b>

I relied on my “eyes” and my numerous combat experiences to predict my opponent’s actions.

<b>

My specialty is indeed counterattacking.

By adding the force the opponent uses in their attack to my own, I can produce more power than usual.

<b>

I moved the tip of my sword just a little toward my opponent.

<b>

“—!”

<b>

Reacting to my movement, Raileus-san’s eyes widened, and he immediately swung his sword diagonally upward.

<b>

Ah, too slow, too slow. And that movement is far too straightforward and simple.

It’s not his fault, as I guided him to move that way with my gaze and actions.

<b>

<b>

Whether it’s a bow, a fist, or a sword—no matter how one fights, there’s always a “preparatory action” that occurs when transitioning to an attack.

<b>

<b>

For a bow, you need to pull the string; for a fist, you bend your elbow like a spring. For a sword, you need to raise it or pull it back behind your body to unleash enough power.

<b>

As he moved, I kicked off the ground and started running while keeping my sword positioned in front of me.

<b>

With Raileus-san raising his sword, the bottom of the sword—though I’m not sure if it can be called the hilt since it’s a wooden sword—was facing me, with a diameter of just about 3 centimeters.

<b>

I layered my attack over his preparatory action.

As Raileus-san pulled his sword back, I thrust forward, pushing against it.

<b>

“—Ha!”

<b>

The tip of my sword accurately struck the hilt of the sword Raileus-san had raised.

<b>

To an onlooker, it might seem like a simple action, but it was a strike that minimized waste to the extreme and sharpened my senses. It’s not something that can be done easily. If it could, it would be a problem.

I practiced thousands, if not tens of thousands, of times to achieve this.

<b>

Raileus-san’s wooden sword flew through the air, clattering sadly as it rolled far behind him.

<b>

As Raileus-san stood there, stunned, looking in the direction the sword had flown, I gently placed my wooden sword against the back of his neck, and he slowly raised both hands, taking a surrender pose.

<b>

“I give up…”

<b>

With a dry laugh, Raileus-san said.

He had an expression mixed with surprise, disbelief, and various other emotions.

<b>

“That’s nine more to go.”

<b>

I said this while pulling back my sword and returning to my original position. The three women who had been watching over me stood there, speechless, without cheering.

It might not have been an exciting battle, but it seems they were surprised, which is good enough.

<b>

<b>

Now, Raileus-san.

Will you be able to launch an attack against me in the remaining matches?
