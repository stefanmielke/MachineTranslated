<b>

A man belonging to the second-best party of the Lindale Kingdom, following the trajectory of Thunder.

His abilities, face, and even name seem to be barely known, making him a second-rate.

<b>

While there was some skepticism about the story of Zeno von Lindale, it was a call from the powerful Lindale Kingdom, and if it was said to be a divine oracle, there was no way to refuse. No, in any case, the countries would not have declined.

This was a good opportunity to deepen exchanges with other countries, and it was undoubtedly an enjoyable event.

<b>

However, the kings of various countries, including the Rezel Kingdom, tried to participate in this match viewing for various reasons. This is a surprising lightness of footwork, precisely because it is a world without prominent disputes between countries.

But the prime ministers and ministers, the heavyweights responsible for the country's administration, put a "stop" to it, and the representatives reluctantly sent only the participants of the martial arts tournament, deciding to appoint substitutes like the first prince and the prime minister.

<b>

For those who do not know Esuar well—mainly people from other countries—believing in the tall tale of "solo clearing an S-rank dungeon" was unlikely, but they would understand once they saw the match—what kind of battle were they planning to show? With such doubts and curious gazes, they turned their eyes to the stage of the arena.

<b>

<b>

Soon, the match begins.

<b>

<b>

The gathered people raised loud cheers at the rapidly unfolding attacks and defenses.

They raised their arms and occasionally shouted Esuar's name, giving enthusiastic support. Some even shouted things like "Here!" or "There's an opening!" as if they were fighting on stage themselves.

<b>

However, that was the reaction of people who did not deeply know dungeons—or battles.

As for those with real skill, they were quietly watching the match.

<b>

"Well, well, is this the hidden gem of the Lindale Kingdom? I am surprised... I can hardly keep up with my eyes. With this, the story of solo clearing an S-rank dungeon seems to gain some truth."

<b>

The prime minister of the Palmour Kingdom spoke to the party "Crimson Blade," which had come from the kingdom to participate in the international martial arts tournament. His tone seemed to contain elements of surprise and disbelief.

In response to the prime minister's words, the party leader, a woman named Neska, moved her throat up and down before slowly shaking her head.

<b>

"With all due respect, Prime Minister. That one is already... beyond the limits of humanity. Esuar and we are not even comparable."

<b>

"Oh? So you believe that it is true that Esuar cleared the S-rank dungeon alone?"

<b>

"Without a doubt, it is true. However, the situation is not that simple."

<b>

The prime minister asked, "What do you mean?" to draw out Neska's words.

<b>

"I don't want to say it too clearly, but... the gap is too great."

<b>

Although she truly wanted to focus on the match like the other party members, the serious Neska could not ignore the prime minister's words.

While keeping her eyes glued to Esuar's every move, she caught sight of the prime minister slightly tilting his head and moved her mouth again.

<b>

"If you have been in dungeons for a long time, you can predict the difficulty of the next dungeon to some extent based on your experiences from E-rank to D-rank, D-rank to C-rank, and C-rank to B-rank. I have not yet seen the boss of an S-rank dungeon, but I can estimate its strength."

<b>

"…Hmm. So, from your perspective, Esuar's strength cannot be contained within the S-rank level, even as someone who has cleared a B-rank dungeon? That there is such a significant difference in strength between us?"

<b>

Neska, receiving the prime minister's words, bit her lip in frustration.

Then, she shook her head.

<b>

"If that were the case, there would still be hope for the Palmour Kingdom to be number one... What I meant when I said I surpassed S-rank, when I said I exceeded human limits, refers to those black beings. Each of those black humanoid entities possesses strength beyond S-rank. As for Esuar, I no longer know what to say... I cannot accurately judge with my level."

<b>

That was a clear declaration of surrender from Neska—the leader of the party reigning at the top of the Palmour Kingdom.

Before deciding victory or defeat, even before the challenge, her heart had already accepted defeat. No matter how many times she envisioned the battle in her mind, she could not see a vision of victory. On the contrary, she did not even know how to land an attack.

<b>

"…When I get back, maybe I should dive into a dungeon."

<b>

Yet, her heart had not yet broken.

She still had plenty of room for growth. There were many things she had yet to try, starting with the third job—she could not give up until she understood just how high Esuar had risen.

<b>

Many participants of the international martial arts tournament, including her, were thinking similar thoughts.
