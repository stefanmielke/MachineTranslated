# 23 The Frenzied Fighter's Full Counterattack

<b>

<b>

<b>

I transferred to the floor where the boss was located, and the scenery changed just a little.

Just because it's the final floor doesn't mean it's specially designed; the change is no different from transferring from the first layer to the second.

<b>

About 100 meters away from where I transferred, the figure of the monster was there.

<b>

A bluish-black body. It was taller than any of the monsters I had defeated so far, with bulging muscles that were noticeable even from a distance.

The name of the monster was Cyclops. It held an axe that was about 3 meters long, staring at me with its sharp red eyes as if it were assessing its prey.

<b>

The players of Tempest referred to this creature as the World Tree.

The name comes from its unnecessarily large body and the fact that it gives the highest quality healing potions. It has a one-hour cooldown, so it's not very convenient.

<b>

I did some stretching exercises and walked toward the monster while rotating my shoulders and neck. I turned my head back just enough to call out to the four behind me.

<b>

"Well then, I'm off. I think it will take at least four hours, so please take your time watching. If you're going to sleep, please take turns."

<b>

It's dangerous if the monster heads that way.

<b>

"Th-that's reckless. There's no way we can win against that..."

<b>

Shin-san had an expression I had never seen before. His body was trembling slightly, and he looked scared.

Upon closer inspection, the other three also seemed to be trembling in a similar manner. This guy is terrifying just by size. He's about three times my height right now.

Moreover, in this world, losing doesn't mean you can respawn. A loss directly leads to death. It's only natural to be scared. Probably.

<b>

"Come on, come on. Please calm down. That thing is relatively slow, so it shouldn't be a problem."

<b>

That said, my body didn't shrink back. I couldn't envision losing.

I smiled broadly and, without waiting for a response, turned my back to them and started walking again.

<b>

I noticed that I was just about halfway between the monster and Shin-san and the others.

<b>

"---Oh no. I spoke as if I knew a lot about this guy. Can I cover it up? I would appreciate it if you could just let it slide."

<b>

Hmm...

<b>

Well, whatever!

<b>

First, let's defeat this thing. I'll think about the rest afterward.

<b>

"Buoooorrrrrr!!"

<b>

When I was about 20 meters away, the monster let out a loud growl. Then, stomping heavily on the ground, it started running toward me, swinging its wicked axe upward to strike diagonally.

<b>

Right? Left? Up? Down? Back? Which way to dodge?

<b>

"Of course, it's forward."

<b>

In times like this, it takes courage to move forward, but the enemy's movements are slower than they appear at hand. Conversely, the further away you are, the more reflexes are needed, making it harder to dodge. Besides, the opponent's weapon is an axe. The most dangerous part is the tip.

<b>

I kicked the ground powerfully and jumped forward. As I slipped under the large hand of the Cyclops holding the axe, I grazed its wrist with my black blade. I felt a faint sensation of cutting flesh transmitted from the hand holding the sword.

<b>

"With these stats, it's about the level of a cat scratch."

<b>

As I muttered this, the Cyclops quickly swung its left fist down at me, so I dodged to the side while raising my sword. Once again, a tiny, tiny wound appeared on the Cyclops's arm.

<b>

This opponent is seasoned in battle. I can read its movements as if they were in my hands.

Despite some visual differences, its movements are familiar.

<b>

And again, the axe was swung. This time, it was aimed low, targeting my feet.

I lightly jumped in place---

<b>

"---Got it."

<b>

As the axe passed directly beneath me, I extended my foot to step on the axe.

Using the momentum from the opponent's swing, I did a front flip in the air---and with that momentum, I slashed the Cyclops's wrist again.

There was no sound of suffering from the monster---of course not. It would hurt more to stub your pinky on a dresser.

<b>

"Even though it's an easy opponent, when your life is on the line, it gets a little nerve-wracking. Ah, I get it. This is like the thrill of a roller coaster. It definitely is."

<b>

I liked roller coasters. Yes. I would immediately get back in line after finishing a ride.

<b>

"Come at me more and more! That won't be enough to entertain me! All your attacks are mine!"

~Shin Side~

<b>

Two hours had passed since SR started fighting the monster. Thanks to the status window, I could tell the time, but the perceived time had easily exceeded ten hours. I had been wishing in my heart, "Please end soon," for so long.

<b>

We had moved close enough to not interfere with the battle, and just barely close enough to see SR's expression.

<b>

"I can't take it anymore... my heart can't handle it..."

<b>

"Are you going to give up and sleep? He said it was okay for him to sleep too."

<b>

"Are you stupid... There's no way I can miss this."

<b>

Even while holding my chest, my gaze never left SR. I wanted to absorb even a little of that outstanding technique.

But it was hard on my heart. I had lost count of how many times I thought SR had died; it was too tedious to even keep track.

<b>

"Honestly, I thought I recognized him, but I underestimated him."

<b>

I agreed with Laika's opinion.

<b>

"Yeah. SR looks down on us. The difference in dimensions is just too much."

<b>

The overwhelming level difference made me lose confidence in continuing as an explorer. My pride as the number one in the kingdom shattered into pieces within five minutes of the battle starting.

<b>

But at the same time, I felt admiration.

<b>

If only I could become like that---if only I could fight so joyfully like that---

<b>

The result of someone with talent who underwent grueling training---that must be it. Someday, I want to catch up to him.

<b>

"---Huh! Ah, I'm glad."

<b>

I thought he had died again.

The Cyclops's massive axe had passed under SR's chin. He continued straight ahead as if nothing had happened, slashing at the enemy's side with his sword.

<b>

"SR is amazing... really amazing."

<b>

Sera watched the battle with her mouth agape, captivated. I understood her feelings, but she should at least keep her mouth closed. It's unbecoming.

<b>

"I don't think I could ever imitate that. It's not just being good at counterattacks."

<b>

Laika next to me said. She wasn't keeping her mouth closed, but her eyes were wide open to the limit.

<b>

No, it's not just that.

<b>

I had heard about her mock battles with Sera, and she had mentioned that she was training to evade, so I had somewhat predicted her fighting style.

She probably dodged the opponent's attacks while looking for openings to counterattack.

<b>

But what is that?

<b>

Just looking at her evasion, I couldn't imagine ever being able to imitate it. The movements were so efficient that it seemed there was no better way, and everything was optimal.

<b>

Moreover, terrifyingly, she was countering every single attack.

<b>

"That guy's fighting style is all about full counters... unbelievable. I really want to question whether he's the same kind of human as me."

<b>

Even as I said it, I wanted to retort, "What the hell is that?" To counter every single attack is just too unreasonable.

<b>

Because there is absolutely no waste in evasion, she can turn it into counterattacks.

It seemed that SR had that ingrained in her body, as her evasion movements seamlessly flowed into her attacks.

<b>

"What's wrong! Is that all you've got?!"

<b>

From afar, I could hear SR's voice, completely unaware of our anxiety. Even though the monster couldn't understand his words, he seemed to be taunting the enemy, as if he craved more attacks.

Every time I heard that voice, I felt cold sweat trickling down.

<b>

"He's a battle maniac. Truly, he's insane."

<b>

Seeing SR's fighting style, Suzu said that. Looking at her face, I could see it was also tense.

I replied shortly to Suzu, "Yeah, I guess so." To continue fighting against such a huge and terrifying enemy with a smile, it could only be described as a battle maniac.

<b>

An hour passed, then another hour, and a total of four hours had passed since the battle with the boss began. That was the shortest time SR had mentioned it would take to finish the battle. If things were going well, it should be ending soon.

<b>

At first glance, the monster appeared battered and bruised, seemingly on the verge of defeat.

<b>

<b>

But I couldn't shake the feeling that SR might lose if things continued like this---his expression had grown increasingly severe.
