# 72 A Certain Holiday with Phenon

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

It has been about six months since I started living near Reinas.

<b>

Thanks to our daily trips to the dungeon, everyone's levels have risen. I think the three members have improved significantly in their skills. I'm enjoying it, but I'm not sure if all of them really want these kinds of days. They say it's "fun," but...

<b>

As someone in a teaching position, it has also been a good opportunity for me to reevaluate my own fighting style.

<b>

From my perspective, having fought hundreds of times against monsters with unreasonable strength like Venom, the monsters in B-rank dungeons are like infants.

I was thinking about that, but it seems I can still become stronger. It appears that the limit I had set was not my physical ability, but rather my mind.

<b>

"What a perfect day for a leisure outing."

<b>

Not that we're going out. Home is the best!

<b>

Today is unusually a day off just for me and Phenon.

Since Phenon and Shiri are often seen together, while I might have some time alone with Sera, opportunities to be alone with Phenon are rare.

In my previous life, I would have been troubled thinking about "what topics should I talk about," but thanks to spending almost every day surrounded by women, I no longer feel unnecessarily tense.

I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

<b>

Today, Shiri has gone to the royal castle to give a progress report, and Sera has gone to visit her family.

<b>

There are always soldiers from the duke's house and the royal family guarding around our house, so if asked whether we are completely alone, the answer would be no. It's quite an environment that makes it hard to be affectionate. Not that we would, though.

They are soldiers from different affiliations, but they seem to be getting along well. I often see soldiers in different armor chatting happily. It's nice that there's peace, but I hope they're doing their jobs properly too.

<b>

I lean my upper body on the wooden deck table and gaze at the green and blue scenery.

In Japan, you might see something similar if you go to the countryside, but it probably wouldn't be as spacious as this. Depending on the direction, you can even see the boundary between the grasslands and the sky.

<b>

"Really, it's nice weather. Shall we go somewhere?"

<b>

"No, this is good... it feels nice."

<b>

A gentle breeze and slightly warm sunlight. If I let my guard down, I might fall asleep.

<b>

I suddenly decide to turn my face towards Phenon, who is sitting across from me.

Though, I just changed my position from resting my cheek on the table to resting my chin on it. My arms are hanging limply under the table.

<b>

"Did you want to go somewhere? I finished the shopping in the morning, so if you want, I can accompany you."

<b>

Phenon shakes her head in response to my question.

<b>

"I don't have any particular plans. I'm just happy to be able to spend time with you, Esar."

<b>

"Haha, thank you for that."

<b>

I chuckle lightly and then rest my cheek back on the table. It's a way to hide my embarrassment.

I'm still not used to her straightforward affection.

<b>

If my appearance were not a beautifully crafted avatar but rather my real self from Earth, would her attitude have changed?

— I ponder such twisted thoughts.

<b>

"It's almost been a year since you came to this world, Esar."

<b>

Phenon spoke as if she were muttering to herself rather than directly addressing me.

When I glanced over, her gaze was directed at the scenery I had been looking at just moments ago. Her profile was not that of a carefree girl but of an adult woman.

Without looking at me, she asked.

<b>

"Do you miss your original world?"

<b>

Earth—Japan... huh.

<b>

"…At least, I don't think about wanting to go back. This world is certainly less advanced compared to the previous one, and there are dangerous jobs like dungeon exploration. But it seems that this world suits me better. Above all, I don't want to return to my original world and leave Sera and Phenon behind."

<b>

This is my genuine feeling.

I do wish I had a car, and not having a smartphone is inconvenient. But there are so many attractive things in this world that outweigh those.

<b>

"I was worried that you might be forcing yourself, so I'm relieved to hear that."

<b>

She smiled at me and continued speaking.

<b>

"Thanks to you coming to this world, I am still alive like this. Being able to laugh with Sera and chat with Shiri are days you have given me. …Sometimes I think about what would have happened if the person summoned back then was someone other than you, Esar, and had the job of a hero."

<b>

"I wonder what would have happened."

<b>

"I don't know. I can't even tell if I was saved or abandoned. But I doubt we would have lived in the same house like this. I don't think I would have become an explorer either."

<b>

"Are you not good with dungeons?"

<b>

"They're really fun! Thanks to you, Esar, I can see myself growing day by day, and I love the feeling of 'working together with my friends!' But I think that premise is based on you being with me, Esar."

<b>

She said shyly, almost embarrassed.

<b>

Really.

<b>

She truly likes me.

But I can't help but wonder if I'm really worth being liked by such a cute girl. If she saw me as I was on Earth, she probably wouldn't have been interested in me at all.

<b>

"My current appearance is not from my original world. To put it bluntly, it's a fake."

<b>

I cut into the conversation and expressed my complaints.

Did Phenon fall for this artificial avatar? My lack of romantic experience brings up such doubts.

<b>

Upon hearing my words, Phenon looked surprised and put her hand to her mouth.

<b>

"I do think your appearance is certainly wonderful. However, I have never once said that I liked your appearance, you know? Even if you had the face of a goblin, I would probably still have fallen in love with you."

<b>

She smiled softly and blushed slightly.

While she is saying something very nice, isn't the comparison a bit too harsh?

<b>

"…Honestly, a girl who sees goblins as potential romantic interests is a little off-putting..."

<b>

"It was just a metaphor!! I wouldn't fall in love with a real goblin!!"

<b>

"Hahaha, I was just joking."

<b>

She puffed up her cheeks and said, "Geez!"

I leaned my elbows on the table and watched her sulkily raise her chin.

<b>

I can't keep relying on her kindness forever.

<b>

Phenon continues to express her affection for me without expecting anything in return.

She doesn't ask, "Have you started to like me yet?" nor does she force me to respond with, "Will you marry me?"

<b>

Her expressions of "like" are overwhelming, though.

<b>

I need to think.

About Phenon, about Sera— and about my own feelings.
