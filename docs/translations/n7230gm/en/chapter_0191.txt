# A-74 Reconsidering the Monster

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The kingdom of Lindale, which I can call my second home.

<b>

The time I spent on Earth for just over thirty years and the few years I've spent here—of course, in terms of memories, Earth still wins, but if asked which is richer, I would find it hard to judge.

<b>

During my student days, I had my fair share of social interactions, and of course, there are precious memories spent with my parents. I still occasionally miss anime and manga, and there were times I felt inconvenienced without electronic devices like computers and smartphones.

<b>

However, since coming to this world, I have met my companions, developed a romantic relationship with Sera and Phenon, encountered the god Noah, and worked hard to save the world. These events have undoubtedly served as a catalyst for my growth as a person.

<b>

If asked what specifically has grown, I would again find it difficult to judge.

<b>

<b>

"I feel kind of nervous..."

<b>

In the first layer of the dungeon, Sera murmurs those words while looking around.

She already possesses the status and skills to fight in an S-rank dungeon, but it seems she is nervous for reasons other than the threat of monsters. Well, I understand her feelings.

<b>

"Haha, that's not like you. I'm actually quite excited."

<b>

In response to Sera, who is slightly tense, Shin said with a laugh.

<b>

"Yes, yes. You should relax more."

<b>

"Hehe, coming to this place with this group really reminds me of that time."

<b>

Following Shin, members of the Thunderbolt Trail, Suzu and Laika, weave their words.

While Sera's expression is stiff, the members of Thunderbolt Trail are casual as if they came for a picnic.

<b>

Yes... currently, we are visiting the B-rank dungeon where we once went to save Phenon—the dungeon where Cyclopes appear—with the same members who tackled it back then.

<b>

The reason is simple—it's just to kill time.

<b>

"If this stirs up any trauma, take it up with Shin. He's the one who suggested it."

<b>

Sera had suffered life-threatening injuries the first time we cleared this dungeon. It was an incident where she stabbed an orc that appeared on the fourth layer, and couldn't pull her sword out, getting beaten up instead. Well, I also got beaten up due to lack of stamina.

<b>

"No, I'm not worried about that. It's just that I'm feeling quite nostalgic... I was still very weak back then."

<b>

Sera said with a deep sense of reflection, as if trying to shake off her past self, she slashed at the air with the sword in her hand.

<b>

"If we're talking about that, we're in the same boat. Back then, I thought I was 'the strongest in the kingdom!'"

<b>

"That confidence was shattered by someone who just showed up out of nowhere."

<b>

"—Ah, now that I remember, I’m getting goosebumps."

<b>

The members of Thunderbolt Trail turned to me with a knowing look, as if they had coordinated it.

It's probably about me. Well, I'll deliberately ignore it. Anything I say might provoke a sharp retort.

<b>

"Speaking of the time we cleared the B-rank dungeon, I was still using honorifics with you all, right?"

<b>

As I said with a smile, they distanced themselves from me as if forgetting we were in a dungeon. Don't pull away that much. Besides, monsters are coming up from behind.

<b>

I swiftly took down the monsters with a magic arrow, but the four of them, feeling uneasy about my sudden use of honorifics, didn't even turn around. I don't know if they trust me or if they're just not feeling tense... either way, it doesn't matter.

<b>

"…I can sense the monsters, but the discomfort in front is quite overwhelming."

<b>

"When you use honorifics, it feels kind of lonely..."

<b>

As Shin and Sera muttered that, Suzu and Laika nodded in agreement.

<b>

"Well, let's stop the joking around—so, here we are again, the five of us in the B-rank dungeon, but honestly, it feels easy, right?"

<b>

As I shrugged and asked, the four of them nodded in unison.

<b>

"Exactly. B-rank dungeons are easy enough to clear solo. That doesn't change even if the opponent is a big guy like a Cyclops. In fact, it's easier because the target is larger."

<b>

"True. I feel bad for the monsters, but this dungeon guarantees elixirs, and we've cleared it over and over."

<b>

I figured as much. The demand for elixirs is endless.

Moreover, this place is close to the royal capital, making it perfect for earning money. Plus, most of the enemies are humanoid, so their movements are easier to discern than other creatures.

<b>

"Well, it's just a difference in knowing about stats or not. You get it now, right? The reason I wasn't so wary of the B-rank dungeon back then."

<b>

I spoke to the four of them in a calm tone, as if to enlighten them.

Surely, they would understand my feelings from back then now—at least, that's what I thought, but...

<b>

"「「「「We don't understand」」」」

<b>

They all clearly denied it. Why?!

<b>

"……Huh?"

<b>

Isn't this the moment where they should say, "Now I understand your feelings," or "So this is what Esuar felt back then"? Am I wrong?

<b>

"No, no, back then you were really low level, right? It’s precisely because we know the details of stats that we understand how abnormal it was for you to casually approach a Cyclops. Ah, so you were a genuine monster after all."

<b>

The women nodded in agreement with Shin.

<b>

Isn't calling me a monster a bit harsh?
