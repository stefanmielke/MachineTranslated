# A-94 Phenon, Shiri, and the Gods

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next day.

<b>

I took Crescent and the others to the city, and in the process, I went on a date-like outing with Sera, but that creates an imbalance for some. Well, that's Phenon.

<b>

Phenon got married around the same time as Sera, but compared to Sera, the time spent together is a bit shorter. It's not that they haven't been alone together, but simply because she sometimes returns to the royal castle, which creates a time gap.

<b>

"Today is our turn, isn't it?"

<b>

That said, neither Phenon nor I are neglecting the time we spend together.

Before going out with Sera yesterday, I had already made plans with her.

However, today we decided to have lunch on a hill near home, and Shiri is with us.

It seems Crescent and the others are going to the dungeon together, and Sera is training with her brother, Rei, for the first time in a while. Noah appears to be lounging around at home.

<b>

"Um... is it alright if I join you?"

<b>

"If I say it's fine, then it's fine."

<b>

"Hahaha... as expected of a princess."

<b>

"Hmph... Are you teasing me, Esuar-san?"

<b>

I responded with laughter to the sulking Phenon. She sulked even more, but when I gently patted her head, she quickly broke into a smile.

<b>

This house is built on a small hill, so the view is good from the start.

However, the sense of openness is vastly different between the view from the house and garden and the view from a place with no obstructions.

So, we walked about two hundred meters from the house—arriving at the base of a large tree that must be at least two meters in diameter—and sat down there. Thanks to the shade, when I placed my hands on the green grass, I felt a slight coolness.

<b>

Since Phenon is here, I made sure to bring a mat to use as a picnic blanket. Actually, everyone had brought one without me needing to prepare it.

We sat down around the basket that Shiri had brought.

<b>

"The weather is nice today. I'm glad it didn't rain."

<b>

As Shiri opened the basket, she said this. Inside were sandwiches and cut fruits.

<b>

"Yeah. It's a bit hot under the sun, but it's just right in the shade."

<b>

"I used to have meals like this with Sera sometimes when I was a child. Though we had guards with us or were in the royal castle's garden. Back then—"

<b>

While listening to Phenon's nostalgic stories, I ate my sandwich.

Occasionally, Phenon would get teased by Shiri, and we enjoyed a cheerful lunch together. The master-servant relationship between Phenon and Shiri is functional, but in a good way, it's relaxed. That tendency had started to show around the time they began going to dungeons.

<b>

No, it was probably a friendly relationship even before that.

<b>

"Next, we're going to the Rezel Kingdom, right?"

<b>

As we relaxed with our post-lunch tea, the topic shifted from the past to the future.

<b>

"Yeah, that's the plan. I think I'll leave when Crescent and Jade settle down, but what do you two think?"

<b>

"I'm fine with that."

<b>

Phenon replied first, and following her, Shiri also agreed. Sera would probably agree too, so it's almost certain. Noah would likely tag along no matter when.

<b>

"I wonder if the Vinzet siblings are doing well."

<b>

The reason I chose Rezel as the next country is that there are two people I met before.

The representatives from the Rezel Kingdom, Arnold Vinzet and Jill Vinzet.

Both of them are friends through sword and fist, and since we're going to Rezel, I want to fight against other members besides the two who participated in the martial arts tournament.

<b>

However, speaking of Arnold...,

<b>

"He really liked Noah, didn't he..."

<b>

Without a doubt, he was a lolicon.

He would say things like wanting to make Noah happy or started calling me "big brother"... Well, he is a good guy, no doubt about that.

<b>

"So, you're worried that I might be taken by Arnold, huh?"

<b>

"I never said anything like that, and I don't want you suddenly appearing, and stop reading people's minds, you brat!"

<b>

I shook off Noah, who had suddenly appeared and pressed against my back, and glared at her.

I don't dislike Noah, but right now, I'm not thinking about that. First, I want to prioritize Sera and Phenon's happiness.

<b>

"I'm going to Rezel too, of course."

<b>

"Well, you're technically a member of ASR too."

<b>

"You seem dissatisfied about something?"

<b>

"Not at all."

<b>

When I answered bluntly, for some reason, Noah had a smirk on her face.

<b>

"Oh, I see, you're just hiding your embarrassment."

<b>

How many times do I have to tell her not to read my mind?
