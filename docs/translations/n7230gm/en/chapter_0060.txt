# 58 You guys, huh...

<b>

<b>

<b>

When the battle that disregarded time between me and the Thunderbolt's Trajectory came to an end, the closing ceremony was held while the excitement still lingered, and the martial arts tournament hosted by the kingdom came to a close.

<b>

During the closing ceremony, there was a greeting from His Majesty, and the captain of the kingdom's knights and Regulus-san spoke about the matches, with the captain mainly discussing the derived secondary jobs—while Regulus-san shared his impressions of the matches involving Sera and me with the Thunderbolt's Trajectory.

<b>

It seemed that Regulus-san skillfully chose his words to avoid making me stand out, but whether that was conscious or unconscious is uncertain. Well, regardless, I am grateful to him.

<b>

The five of us who participated as guests were waiting in the break room for the audience to leave to avoid causing a commotion, so we were able to exit the arena just after 8 PM.

The people managing the facilities treated us to dinner, and while talking with the Thunderbolt's Trajectory and Sera, time passed in the blink of an eye.

<b>

<b>

"Phew, for now, the troublesome events are over."

<b>

As we exited the arena, we were chatting while heading towards 'Barto,' which we had used for a celebration before.

<b>

Tonight, we have a drinking party. Although, Suzu and I won't be drinking.

<b>

The sunlight hid behind the earth, and instead, the streetlights illuminated the path we walked. Unlike during the day, it was hard to discern people's faces, but there were still those who whispered while glancing at us. Do celebrities always experience this kind of feeling?

<b>

"I admit it's troublesome, but surprisingly, it was enjoyable, wasn't it? Besides, it was a good opportunity to showcase the abilities of Esuar and Sera."

<b>

Nodding in agreement beside Shin, Suzu shot me a dissatisfied glance.

<b>

"Still, Esuar is underestimating us too much. I never imagined we would have a match with a priest."

<b>

"Even so, we couldn't win. I want to take a peek into what's going on in Esuar's head."

<b>

"There's not much in there... I mean, if we're talking about professions, could you keep your voice down a bit? What if someone overhears?"

<b>

As I said this, I looked around, but fortunately, no one was paying attention to us.

<b>

However, instead, I spotted something strange.

<b>

"Whoa..."

<b>

I couldn't help but let out such a sound at the sight of a group that couldn't blend into the city's scenery. The desire to turn around and leave clashed with my curiosity about what kind of people they were.

<b>

One of the group ahead was waving a large flag that read "Long Live the Hero!" as they approached us.

<b>

There were about ten of them. Upon closer inspection, in addition to the flag praising me, there were also flags that said "The Sword Saint Returns" and "Sera is the Best." What on earth is this group?

<b>

As they drew closer, it seemed that all of them were men.

<b>

"Hehehe, I’ve become famous too."

<b>

Why are you so happy? I'm so embarrassed I can't stand it.

<b>

The Thunderbolt's Trajectory will probably laugh and mock me again—I thought as I turned my gaze to the side, where Shin and Laika were smirking, and for some reason, Suzu had a stern expression.

<b>

Maintaining that expression, Suzu quickly walked over to the group. While walking, she naturally pulled a spear from her inventory as if she were taking out a smartphone from her pocket.

And then, she thrust it vigorously into the stomach of the man at the front.

<b>

"—Ugh!"

<b>

The man holding the flag let out a pathetic scream without having a chance to resist and collapsed on the spot. The flag rolled on the ground with a clatter.

<b>

...What on earth is happening?

<b>

Since she had struck with the butt end of the spear rather than the sharp tip, it seems there was no serious bleeding, but that looked extremely painful for that guy.

I thought the surrounding companions would be worried about the fallen man, but they stood still in a rigid posture, not moving an inch.

<b>

As I walked toward them in confusion, I heard Suzu's voice, filled with anger, directed at the men.

<b>

"What’s with the way you’re waving that flag? I don’t recall telling you to expose such a disgraceful appearance to the public."

<b>

"““““We are very sorry!”””””

<b>

"I can't hear you well; your voices are too quiet."

<b>

"““““We are very sorry!!”””””

<b>

No, that's too loud. The first shout was already loud enough. You're being a nuisance to the neighborhood.

<b>

By the way, what on earth is Suzu saying? Are you their boss? Did you come up with that flag idea?

<b>

While I was perplexed, Suzu, standing tall, turned to look at me with an exasperated expression and asked,

<b>

"Esuar, Sera-san, what should we do with these guys?"

<b>

She was asking such a thing.

<b>

I have no idea. Why are you asking us? And who are those people?

<b>

As I hesitated on how to respond, Sera leaned forward, seemingly noticing something.

<b>

"That man... isn't he the one who approached us in front of the guild on the day the announcement for the derived advanced jobs was made?"

<b>

She squinted her eyes and said while observing the man's face.

<b>

"The one who approached us—wasn't he the guy who said something about being a nuisance?"

<b>

"Yes. I recognize that crying face."

<b>

Now that you mention it, he does resemble the person who was lifted by Regulus-san—actually, it seems to be him.

<b>

Despite having insulted us thoroughly back then, they are now holding flags that say "Long Live the Hero!" and "Sera is the Best."

Could it be that the banner we saw in the audience right after the match was also from these guys?

<b>

Even if the face is similar, their actions are so opposite that I can't believe they are the same person.

<b>

"I tried to stop them... but at least that flag is a bit..."

<b>

"Embarrassing, right..."

<b>

Shin and Laika said apologetically next to me. Yeah, it's really embarrassing.

<b>

"Is that so? I think it's fine."

<b>

With a grin on her face, Sera said while following the flag that said "The Sword Saint Returns" with her eyes. It's nice to see you so happy.

<b>

Letting out a deep sigh, as if squeezing the air out of my entire body, I turned to Suzu and asked, "What the hell is this?"

Then she puffed out her not-so-full chest and confidently replied.

<b>

"I told Esuar properly. We would 'take care of them.' I made sure to reform them perfectly."

<b>

"I said at that time, 'It's fine!' Didn't I! And besides, this is clearly not a level of reformation! They are practically different people now!"

<b>

Suzu used the word "we," but judging by Shin and the others' reactions, it's clear that she acted on her own!

<b>

"There is no mercy for explorers with a disrespectful attitude, Esuar. I did a good job, if I do say so myself."

<b>

With a huff, she said.

Then Suzu gestured with her chin to the explorer group, signaling them to "get lost."

The men, who had been neatly dealt with by Suzu, bowed their heads to me and Sera as they disappeared into the night.

<b>

I should avoid making her an enemy.

<b>

I etched this deeply into my heart that day.
