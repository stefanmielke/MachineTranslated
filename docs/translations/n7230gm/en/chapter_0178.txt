# A-62 Continued: The Inhumanity of the SR

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the Kingdom of Palmour, S-rank dungeon.

While being watched over by Sera and the other three, I single-handedly conquered the first to fifth floors of this dungeon, which is considered the most challenging in this world. I am in a cheerful state, ready to have some fun with the boss.

<b>

There are many enemies, the map is vast, and after taking breaks, it is already past nine o'clock at night, but my physical condition is in perfect shape――and my heart is racing at its peak as I face the nine-tailed fox for the first time in a while.

It’s been a while, hasn’t it…… the battle with the nine-tailed fox.

Since this world was destroyed and Noah casually summoned it for leveling up. Back then, I was fighting multiple foes, and I wonder how many years it has been since I fought one-on-one.

<b>

"I don't think it's necessary for you, SR-kun, but if you need to return urgently, just call out."

<b>

"Please be careful."

<b>

As I was about to touch the 'Challenge the Boss' window, Niz and Neska called out to me. However, contrary to their words, they didn't seem particularly worried. Perhaps that means they recognize my strength.

<b>

"Well, I will win, of course. However, the nine-tailed fox is the perfect training partner for me, so I might play around a bit."

<b>

At my words, Noah, who knows my past, said, "Ah, now that you mention it, that was the case."

And Sera, who knows my personality, smiled wryly and said, "Just don't overdo it."

<b>

<b>

And so, the long-awaited boss battle begins.

I had the four spectators wait in the back while I walked up to the nine-tailed fox, which was quietly sitting with its tails swaying.

<b>

This nine-tailed fox is quite a strong monster, as expected from an S-rank dungeon boss. If I were to compare it to a typical role-playing game, Venom would be the Demon King, and the bosses of S-rank dungeons would be like the Four Heavenly Kings. Since there are six of them, should it be the Six Heavenly Kings? That sounds awkward.

<b>

Physical attacks are effective against this enemy with high magical defense.

However, it is difficult to approach due to the barrage of magic unleashed by the nine-tailed fox――in other words, the proper strategy for defeating the nine-tailed fox is said to be archers like Shiri.

<b>

Sword-type professions like 'Sky Sword' and 'Destruction Sword' are also one means of long-range attack, but the enemy's magic has a longer range than these attacks. And the archer's range is longer than the enemy's magic――thus, the saying 'Archers are best against the nine-tailed fox' is somewhat common knowledge.

<b>

Well, that's just common knowledge for 'beginners.'

It has nothing to do with the ranked players of Tempest, including myself.

<b>

"Alright, it's been a while since my evasion training, nine-tailed fox."

<b>

As I jogged towards the nine-tailed fox, it first fired magic from the tips of its nine tails, seemingly observing me. Nine flames, one for each tail.

I dodged that attack while increasing my speed.

<b>

"Here we go――there's still a big gap, you know."

<b>

From this spot, I could attack with the Destruction Sword――but I pushed further ahead.

Perhaps finally considering me a threat, the nine-tailed fox growled in intimidation and unleashed more magic――the number increased dramatically to three times――a total of twenty-seven flames.

<b>

I dashed through the gaps of those bluish-white flames. If there’s a gap of a few centimeters plus my body, there's no need to stop my feet.

<b>

"――Hmm. Was it this easy……? Wasn't it supposed to be a bit more difficult?"

<b>

I slashed at the enemy's foot with the White Lotus and took a bit of distance. Although I was within the enemy's range, it was a safe zone for me, so there was no problem.

Hmm…… the nine-tailed fox is one of the upper-tier monsters among S-rank dungeon bosses, but…….

Since being reborn into this world, I’ve fought Venom and the 'Moon' party, and the last time I fought, it was a mix of other S-rank dungeon bosses, so this feels incredibly easy.

I didn't mind the cotton candy from the Lindell Kingdom since it was originally weak…… but maybe it would be best for Lady Idea to make some adjustments. In this world, where Venom and the other ranked players are gone, there are currently no opponents I can truly enjoy battling against.

<b>

It seems it will still take some time for the people of this world to fully grow.

<b>

"Well, for now, let's do some evasion training in close combat. If Lady Idea does nothing, it might turn out to be a completely futile effort."

<b>

Muttering to myself like this, I continued to evade and lightly counterattack.

<b>

And indeed, I ended up defeating the nine-tailed fox without feeling any struggle at all.
