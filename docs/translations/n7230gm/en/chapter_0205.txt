# A-88 Premonition

<b>

<b>

<b>

Since there were no other errands in the royal capital, all members of ASR returned to their home near Reinas.

It would have been fine to rest at the party house in the royal capital, but over there, Shin and Regulus would casually drop by, and it felt more like an 'office' or 'workplace.' So, they returned to their more relaxing home.

<b>

There was also the presence of Crescent, who would now be living with them.

Sera and the others didn't refuse, and besides, there were extra rooms available. If Crescent herself didn't mind, there was no problem at all.

<b>

"Do you remember one of the members of 'Moon' named Hime-Suki?"

<b>

The day after returning to Reinas, I was sitting on the living room sofa, enjoying tea that Siri had made, and chatting with Crescent.

<b>

"Of course I remember. All the members of 'Moon' were strong, after all... Well, when it comes to Hime-Suki, I have a stronger impression of her as a ranked player in individual battles."

<b>

If I had to say more, she seemed to admire me—or rather, she had an image of worship. It was probably because I was using the same profession as her, 'Demon Lord'... Speaking of which, there was a time when Hime-Suki asked me to teach her how to use Byakuren, wasn't there?

<b>

In the end, I just dodged the topic and escaped.

<b>

"So, what about Hime-Suki?"

<b>

"I thought it would have been nice if Hime-chan could come here too."

<b>

"No, no, that's impossible. Besides, Crescent died over there—"

<b>

Just as I was about to say that, I realized one possibility and stopped my words. Crescent nodded while looking straight into my eyes.

<b>

"Hime-chan—Hime-Suki passed away from illness before I died in a traffic accident."

<b>

<b>

<b>

"My condolences—though we are technically the dead too. I don't think of ourselves as zombies, though."

<b>

"That's true... Well, there are parts we can't do anything about! Plus, we can't just call back the deceased from over there endlessly, so it was just a fleeting thought, so you don't have to worry too much about it."

<b>

After saying that, Crescent picked up the teacup placed on the table and took a sip of tea. While her mouth was smiling, her eyebrows were furrowed.

<b>

Well, Crescent and Hime-Suki were close, so she might have thought, 'What if we could be reborn in the same world?' ...Huh? Wait a minute?

<b>

"Uh, by the way. Could it be that you were dating Hime-Suki?"

<b>

"—Bwah! Wh-what are you suddenly saying!? Hime-chan is a girl!"

<b>

"I-I see. Well, I wasn't sure about that girl's gender—after all, I've heard of girls dating each other."

<b>

I haven't seen it directly in real life, though.

<b>

"That's not it! That girl was a junior from the same high school! Well, it's true we were close, but we weren't in a relationship or anything like that!"

<b>

While wiping the tea I had spat out with a handkerchief, Crescent glared at me and explained. Then she added, "I normally prefer men! And I'm 'unmarried,' okay?" I don't think I need to add that I don't think she has feelings for me.

<b>

"Well, that's fine, but—why was Crescent able to come here?"

<b>

When I threw that question out, Crescent tilted her head and placed her index finger on her chin.

<b>

"Hmm... Unlike Esuar, I didn't have any specific mission, so maybe it was just Lady Idea's whim? Also, I had some connection with Esuar and was a top player in individual battles, I guess?"

<b>

"I see."

<b>

Hmm... If that's the case, Crescent coming here wasn't to give her a second life—it was simply to entertain me? No, that might be a bit too self-centered, right?

<b>

"Maybe not."

<b>

As I pondered over the past events, I heard footsteps descending the stairs, and Noah called out to me. I don't know how much she had heard, but she seemed to understand enough to join the conversation.

<b>

"What do you mean?"

<b>

"Yeah. I think one of Lady Idea's purposes was to gain divine power from my world, but I also believe she wished for my brother's soul to be happy. So, I don't think your thoughts are entirely off-base?"

<b>

"Hmm... So what? Are you saying Crescent came here because I thought, 'Isn't there a stronger opponent to compete with?'"

<b>

"Yeah. It feels like a reward for saving the world."

<b>

That's a grand scale story. Even though it's about me.

<b>

"So, could it be that if I wished for Hime-Suki to come too, Lady Idea might do something about it?"

<b>

Thinking it was ridiculous, I asked Noah, and she nodded at my words, saying, "It's just a possibility, though."

<b>

"Seriously...?"

<b>

When I looked at Crescent sitting on the opposite sofa—she was looking at me with sparkling eyes, as if expecting something.
