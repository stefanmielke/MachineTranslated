# A-16 Who is the Dense One?

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Good job. The first layer seemed easy."

<b>

After defeating all 30 kobolds that appeared in this layer, Arnold took out a bottle of water from his inventory and showcased a refreshing drinking style that looked like something out of a TV commercial.

This dungeon, being a grassland type, has sunlight pouring down regardless of day or night, making one want to hydrate even without exercising.

<b>

"Glug, glug, glug—phew... Yeah, I've had experience defeating similar monsters many times."

<b>

"That’s what I thought."

<b>

Different types of kobolds also appear in the B-rank dungeon of Rezell.

<b>

"How far did you get in the B-rank dungeons of the Kingdom of Rezell?"

<b>

"Ha ha! With my party, we've conquered all the B-rank dungeons of the Kingdom of Rezell! Alone, I managed to get to the fourth layer."

<b>

Solo to the fourth layer—got it. 

<b>

There might be some discrepancies depending on which B-rank dungeon in the Kingdom of Rezell it is, but I have a rough understanding of Arnold's individual strength.

<b>

His current profession is martial swordsman, and his level is said to be 65.

The main reason he can't conquer dungeons alone is likely due to a lack of stamina, but he also feels a bit lacking in skill. With his level of ability, there are probably a few people in the Lindell Kingdom, excluding Shin and the others. He might be a good match against Sera's brother—Ray.

<b>

"Are you going to tackle the second layer alone? I can assist if needed."

<b>

With her arms crossed and a fidgety demeanor, Sera called out to Arnold.

I felt like I could hear Sera's inner voice saying she wanted to fight too since we had been watching his battles for over an hour. 

Of course, that makes sense. After all, we were just sitting there watching him fight. And if that continued for several more hours, it was clear we would be bored.

<b>

"No, I'll go as far as I can alone—I've got to show Noah a good time! Ha ha ha!"

<b>

However, the self-proclaimed strongest man of the Kingdom of Rezell, oblivious to our feelings, laughed heartily and rolled up his sleeves to show his enthusiasm.

<b>

Does he not notice Noah's face tightening?

Is he not seeing Sera, who is clearly slumping her shoulders?

Did he not hear my sigh?

<b>

Honestly... what a dense guy. Perhaps he is happy because of his insensitivity.

<b>

After that, Arnold, as he declared after clearing the first layer, continued to defeat the monsters of the second and third layers alone. As he progressed, fatigue began to show on his face, and there were moments when he got injured due to distraction, but he somehow completed it.

<b>

From our perspective, since Noah had entered as a healer, I intended to heal him without using consumables, but he ended up treating himself with his own potions.

When I told Arnold that Noah would heal him from now on, he lamented with a face like the end of the world, saying, "I wish you had told me earlier."

<b>

During the break before advancing to the fourth layer, I decided to change the topic to lift Arnold's spirits, who looked dejected. Well, I don't think we need to cheer him up, but I felt a bit guilty for forgetting to mention our professions... and I had something I wanted to ask.

<b>

"Were there any standout strong individuals in the International Martial Arts Tournament besides those who wield swords? Oh, and not from Lindell."

<b>

As I asked this while sitting cross-legged on the ground, Arnold, who had been on all fours staring at the ground, slowly lifted his face and met my gaze. His eyes lacked energy. It seemed he was quite frustrated about not being healed by Noah.

<b>

"...If that's the case, it would be my sister. Just so you know, I'm not being biased because she's family, okay? She earned her ticket to the International Martial Arts Tournament through her own strength. I may be the strongest in swordsmanship in the Kingdom of Rezell, but without a weapon, my sister—Jill Vinsett—is the strongest."

<b>

...Oh. So without a weapon—she must be a martial artist.

<b>

"How does she compare to Laika?"

<b>

Perhaps interested in this topic, Sera joined the conversation. Noah, perhaps wary of Arnold, remained unmoving from behind me at an angle. She really moves like a little sister, doesn’t she? Is this some kind of act?

<b>

"Laika is the female representative of the Lindell Kingdom, right? In a one-on-one match, she could have engaged in a simple strength comparison, but unfortunately, the martial arts tournament was a party battle."

<b>

"But she got beaten up by the Thunder Trail, right? And it was three against five."

<b>

"Ugh... The words of the 'Sword Princess' are quite harsh. Yes, we were thoroughly defeated by the Thunder Trail. However, the Kingdom of Rezell was essentially a makeshift party, so we couldn't move as coordinated as they did. If it had been an individual match, the victory might have gone to the Kingdom of Rezell."

<b>

It might be a case of sour grapes, but that's a bit unrealistic.

<b>

Even if there were issues with job compatibility, explorers from other countries would have a hard time against the Thunder Trail, who have gained numerous player bonuses.

Of course, Laika, being an attacking class, and even Suzu, who plays a supportive role in the party, can now take down a Cyclops solo.

<b>

"Ha ha, I’m looking forward to seeing individual matches."

<b>

Eventually, the existence of status bonuses will become known in this world.

While derivative secondary jobs aside, someone will surely notice if many jobs are changed to reach a tertiary job.

<b>

Once statuses reach the same level, the outcome will be determined by reflexes, skill usage, experience, and talent.

Even members of the Thunder Trail and ASR won't be able to relax just because I'm here—just because I have knowledge. I'm really looking forward to it.

<b>

I hope that the explorers of this world will strive to seize the title of Overlord. On one hand, I wish for such a future, but on the other, I can't help but think it might be an unattainable wish.

<b>

I just can't see Shin and Sera growing to the top player level of "Tempest." This isn't a matter of talent; it's an overwhelming difference in experience.

<b>

Having repeatedly challenged opponents stronger than themselves, dying countless times, and going through trial and error hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of times, I can't imagine that residents of this world, who face game over after losing once, could grow to that level.

<b>

Thus, having experienced defeat many times, I am confident that I will not lose in this world—this is my conviction.

Moreover, the outrageous advantage of being an Overlord supports that belief.

<b>

However, if by any chance.

<b>

In the party ranking battles in Tempest—if I were to face the five members of "Moon," who have reigned at the top for five years, even with the Overlord class allowing unlimited skill use, the outcome would likely be fifty-fifty.

<b>

"Ha..."

<b>

A sigh escapes me at the thought of an unattainable wish.

If I could fight them again, it would surely be enjoyable.
