# 89 Encounter

<b>

<b>

<b>

Everyone challenges the S-rank dungeon.

I reluctantly agreed to the proposal put forth by the three of them. After all, it would be a huge problem if I disappeared during battle, so the condition is that I will be the one primarily engaging in combat.

<b>

They probably made this suggestion to avoid putting mental pressure on me, but for me, it felt like creating memories with Sera and the others.

After all, I expect that regardless of the outcome against Venom, I won't be able to see them for several years.

I don't think they are considering such things, but there's no need to say it out loud. I can't derive an exact number either.

<b>

"It's fine to go now, but... it's sudden."

<b>

"Things like this are better acted upon when the thought strikes you. You wouldn't want it to be too late, would you?"

<b>

"Well, that's true."

<b>

Since Sera hasn't cleared the A-rank dungeon yet, I thought she might not be able to enter the S-rank dungeon, but it seems she had already traversed it with the Thunderbolt Trails while I was going around alone. Quite well-prepared.

<b>

"We'll leave everything in our inventory with Esuar. It would be a waste if it disappeared."

<b>

Suzu said this and began to toss potions, equipment, and money onto the living room table. Before long, half of the table was obscured.

<b>

"That's true. I'll do the same."

<b>

"You are definitely the richest person in the country."

<b>

Following Suzu, Shin and Sera also began to dump the contents of their inventories onto the table.

To prevent the table from overflowing with items, I busily stuffed various things into my own inventory. The sight of my discarded items being stored away into another dimension one after another would surely make someone from Earth question their eyes.

<b>

I think I saw something that looked like underwear among the items Sera took out, but I said nothing and put it into my inventory. I SEE NOTHING.

<b>

"I'll make sure to return everything properly, so remember what I gave you."

<b>

"That kind of thing is fine as it is. Honestly, I don't even know how much money I have."

<b>

"Exactly."

<b>

Saying such things with a nonchalant attitude, 

<b>

"We're in the same party, so feel free to use all of my things, Esuar."

<b>

With a smirk, Sera said this.

She seems to be trying to convey her trust in me, but you're handing me your underwear? How am I supposed to use that? Wear it?

<b>

"I'll return it properly."

<b>

After giving a somewhat appropriate response, I returned to my task.

Such casual exchanges will probably feel like a distant memory in just a few days.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing organizing our inventories, we properly equipped ourselves for dungeon exploration and left the house.

One of the guards, noticing our imposing appearance, walked over, and Shin and Suzu went to handle it. They were probably explaining that we were about to challenge the S-rank dungeon.

<b>

"By the way, did Sera and the others give any instructions to the guards? They stopped saying anything when I ignored the rules and entered the dungeon."

<b>

"Ah, the three of us—me, Shin, and Suzu—went to speak directly with His Majesty. We told him, 'Don't interfere with Esuar.' Was that unnecessary?"

<b>

"That's pretty bold. Well, it helped."

<b>

"At least for me, Shin and Suzu now have tremendous authority. Clearing an A-rank dungeon is quite an achievement, you know? It might not be a big deal for Esuar, but..."

<b>

"Hahaha..."

<b>

As we were having that conversation, Shin and Suzu returned.

The guard they spoke with seemed to be contacting someone with a communication magic tool. They were likely reporting to the higher-ups, but in this world that is about to collapse, I wonder how much meaning that action holds.

<b>

"I don't think it has any meaning, but I told them we are about to challenge the dungeon."

<b>

Suzu seems to be thinking the same thing as me. She shrugged and exhaled a bit heavily through her nose.

<b>

"Nobody knows what will happen next."

<b>

Shin is right.

No one, not even me—the one who should understand the situation best—can clearly state what will happen next. I can only make predictions based on past events and the current situation.

If I could speak face-to-face with the brat who told me to "defeat Venom," I might be able to grasp what is happening in this world.

<b>

That voice has not spoken to me since the Thunderbolt Trails cleared the A-rank dungeon. Perhaps if we clear the S-rank dungeon, it might say something again, but that's just a guess. In other words, I still have a lot of unknowns.

<b>

We arrived at one of the six S-rank dungeons, located in the direction of the city of Renus. Even though I know its contents from the game, I have no idea what lies inside this dungeon.

However, just because I don't know doesn't mean I want to investigate everything; it's already a hassle. I don't need to know where it was supposed to appear.

<b>

After all, the S-rank dungeon is my territory. It was a place I frequented during the Tempest era. I have all the monsters, drop items, and terrain memorized.

<b>

As the four of us approached the transfer magic circle, four stone pillars appeared to set our license cards. Since I will be diving in as the leader this time, I set my card in the host stone pillar.

<b>

"Alright, let's go."

<b>

Once everyone finished setting their cards, the transfer circle activated. We were enveloped in light.

<b>

"Ah... But a completely unknown dungeon is nerve-wracking."

<b>

"Especially since it's S-rank. If we let our guard down, we could end up in the afterlife in an instant."

<b>

"Esuar, don't do anything dangerous either."

<b>

"I'm fine. More importantly, you should worry about yourselves."

<b>

As Suzu mentioned earlier, if we die before disappearing, that would be a real problem.

With their stats, they could probably handle anything except the boss, but it's better to keep an eye on them just in case.

<b>

While I was absentmindedly thinking about such things, I was transferred into the dungeon.

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

<b>

—I thought I had been transferred.

<b>

"What... is this place?"

<b>

A gray sky, a gray plain. A lifeless landscape.

I involuntarily gasped at the sight, which felt like watching a black-and-white television.

It didn't match any of the six S-rank dungeons. It was a scene I had never seen before.

<b>

"—! Sera! Shin! Suzu! Where are you!?"

<b>

I looked around and shouted.

No matter which direction I looked, the same scenery was everywhere, and I couldn't see their figures or even any monsters. What on earth is this place?

<b>

Could it be that everyone disappeared together...?

<b>

"Sera Bernot has not disappeared yet. However, I'm sorry to say that Shin and Suzu have disappeared. I want to conserve my strength as much as possible."

<b>

Above.

<b>

A voice like the sound of a bell descended from above.

<b>

When I looked up, there was a boy—no, a girl—with an androgynous face, about the age of an elementary school student.

She wore a dress with a gradient of white and pink, and around her clothing floated pale pink feathers as if defying gravity. Her hair, which reached her shoulders, was a light pink gold.

<b>

However, it was precisely because of her glamorous appearance that the left half of her face was darkly discolored, as if it had necrosis, which stood out the most.

<b>

"Who are you...?"

<b>

I glared at the girl who slowly descended in front of me, filled with overflowing rage.

Her earlier statement—and that familiar voice. If my guess is correct, she knows everything. About this world, and the mysterious phenomena occurring now.

<b>

"Nice to meet you, Esuar. I'm what you call a 'brat,' the one who summoned you to this world—and the god who created this world." 

<b>
