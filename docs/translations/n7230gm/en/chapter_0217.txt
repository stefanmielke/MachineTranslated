# A-100 The Reason for the Event

<b>

<b>

<b>

The drunk man who picked a fight with us was the guild master.

I wondered if such a thing could happen, and then I remembered that I had also been challenged to a duel by Renaus's Lyles in Lindale.

<b>

Even though this world is mainly about explorers, I can't help but think that it's a bit too reckless. No, I probably had similar thoughts before, but this time it was particularly impactful.

<b>

"Well, don't take it too badly, 'Emperor.' Just think of it as a little boredom relief."

<b>

As I sulked about being deceived, the guild master—Soubi—patted my shoulder and said this. The explorers were sitting in the corner of the training ground, drinking potions and taking breaks. By the way, Soubi, who had been blown away by Sera, was also drinking a potion.

<b>

Neither Sera, Noah, nor I lost anything, so it's fine... but was it really necessary to make it such an exaggerated event?

As I pondered this, the receptionist, who had been bowing low and acting all polite, explained the situation to me.

<b>

Apparently, shortly before we arrived, information had spread in the guild that we were coming to provide guidance, but there seemed to be several explorers who opposed it.

Among the explorers currently in the guild, only Soubi had seen our fight. He was apparently a bit of a lazy person, and it seems he decided, "If that's the case, then you should see for yourselves."

<b>

"Then wouldn't it have been better to just have a mock battle?"

<b>

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It's all because of this!"

<b>

When Sera shot a glare, the receptionist flinched and immediately threw her boss under the bus. I wondered how the boss, referred to as "this," would take it, but,

<b>

"That would be more exciting!"

<b>

With a carefree expression, he said that. I felt like I could faintly see how he usually behaved and how he was treated by the receptionist.

<b>

"Well, it's fine, isn't it? Regardless of the process, your abilities have been conveyed to our explorers."

<b>

Saying this, he pointed with his thumb at the explorers resting behind him.

It seemed they had heard the situation from Soubi, but... is this really okay? He said the abilities were conveyed, but only Sera fought from start to finish, and Noah and I just watched from the back.

Since the outcome was already known, there wasn't even any cheering.

During Sera's self-introduction, she had said, "The weakest me will take on the challenge," so I thought some might have understood that... but no, Noah looks like a grade schooler, so isn't it difficult to believe just from words?

<b>

"Huh? I'm just watching, so you don't have to worry about me."

<b>

Don't read my mind.

<b>

"Well, you two do your best. I'm not interested in guidance, so I'll just watch you guys work~"

<b>

Noah said this, waved at Sera and me, and sat down on a wooden bench by the guild building, swinging his legs back and forth. A large part of the reason Noah followed us was probably to escape from the lolicon named Arnold. Being alone would be boring, so he probably just came over here for the sake of it.

<b>

If I were to be conceited, I would say that my presence is one of the reasons too.

As I sighed and thought about this, Noah turned towards us with a grin and made a big circle with his hands. So don't read my mind.

After taking another deep sigh, I looked at Sera. She was also wearing a different kind of smile than Noah. Then, she whispered in my ear.

<b>

"I understand that I surpass you in status, but I can still see the difference in skill. It makes me feel happy."

<b>

I felt my heart race secretly due to her breathy tone, but I made sure not to show any signs of it and replied, "That's the result of training."

<b>

<b>

☆　☆　☆　☆　☆

<b>

A total of twenty-four explorers participated in our training.

If I were to train each one individually, it would take too long, and if I tried to do it all at once, it would be hard to manage. There are many swordsmen, but there are also people from other professions, so I can't just teach swordsmanship.

<b>

So, it wasn't exactly a desperate measure, but we decided to adopt the method that seemed best at the moment.

I would take charge of the remaining eleven, while Sera would handle the thirteen who used swords. And Soubi, the guild master, would also join my side, making a total of twelve.

I mean, shouldn't you be the one to coordinate this?

<b>

"Uh... what should I talk about?"

<b>

With Soubi and the others sitting on the ground in front of me, I found twelve of them sitting there. They weren't neatly lined up or sitting with good posture, but that was to be expected. However, it seemed everyone was willing to listen to what I had to say.

Even though I had a past of avoiding interactions with people, I had gotten quite used to it since coming to this world. Crescent and Hime-suki—no, now it's Hisui. A glimpse of my old self emerged when I thought of them.

<b>

"I'm not going to come here every day, so I thought I'd briefly share my area of expertise. Is that okay?"

<b>

"Oh, that's good—though, isn't SR not particularly good with swords?"

<b>

Soubi, who was sitting cross-legged near me, said this. While I am good with swords, it's not my strongest suit, and that would defeat the purpose of splitting with Sera.

<b>

When it comes to my area of expertise, there's only one thing that comes to mind.

After all, I am the man known as ASR—Avoidance's SR.
