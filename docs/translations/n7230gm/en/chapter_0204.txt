# A-87 The Past of the Moon and SR

<b>

"Ah, I messed up—it's probably because I took Crescent's attack about seven moves ago... If I had forced myself to evade back then, the damage from Hime-Suki's gravity magic would have been less."

<b>

After being eliminated in the finals of the ranking battle's party division, I was slumped alone on the sofa in the dedicated lobby. Surrounding me were other participants who had already lost, as well as those who had advanced, all focused on the next match displayed by hologram.

<b>

The two groups currently in battle, along with the seventeen groups present in this lobby, are the participants of the final tournament. A total of ninety-six people. The odd number is due to the fact that while others are participating with the maximum of five members, I am participating alone.

<b>

In individual battles—also known as the 'Gathering of the Shura' ranking battle—one might feel great by winning repeatedly, but if the game isn't thrilling, neither I nor my opponents would enjoy it.

<b>

Now, since my being alone here is just making the atmosphere worse, I should quickly leave this place and watch the rest of the matches at the inn. If I had advanced, I wouldn't be able to leave this lobby, but that doesn't concern me since I lost.

<b>

Just as I thought that and was about to tap 'Exit the Land of Strife EX' on the menu screen—

<b>

"Ah! SR-san is trying to leave again! Please watch the ranking battle until the end for once!"

<b>

I heard a somewhat flustered voice. When I looked in the direction of the voice, I saw two people I had just seen at the match venue. Apparently, the remaining party members were somewhere else.

<b>

"Well, well. It seems SR-san doesn't really like socializing, so forcing it isn't good, Mika."

<b>

Next to Crescent, Hime-Suki, dressed as a kunoichi, shrugged her shoulders.

By the way, the reason she calls Crescent 'Mika' is due to a very straightforward equation: Crescent, crescent moon, Mika.

<b>

Hime-Suki, like me, uses the Demon Lord profession, and she is a chaotic character with mismatched name, profession, and appearance. Furthermore, she is a tomboy? A professional gamer like Crescent, and her gender is ambiguous—a character that's too intense. Please narrow it down to just one.

<b>

"Isn't it fine if I'm not here? ...I don't talk to anyone anyway."

<b>

"Self-deprecating! You're still self-deprecating! Is that the secret to your strength!?"

<b>

"That's definitely not it, Mika. And if you say something rude to SR-san, I'll get angry, okay? If you say something weird next time, you'll have to treat me to pancakes as punishment, got it?"

<b>

"Yikes!? Hime-chan is serious about her words, so that's no joke!"

<b>

Looks like a noisy situation has arrived...

I don't want to get too familiar, but since I don't want to be hostile in the game as much as possible, I decided to ask, "Are you two friends in real life?"

<b>

"That's right! Hime-chan is my junior from high school—and wait, that's not it! If I talk about that, my age will be revealed! I didn't come here to talk about that! Since we've just finished an intense battle, what we should be doing now is discussing our impressions!"

<b>

"That's a hassle."

<b>

"SR-san, your words are harsh! Your STR is high!"

<b>

As I said, I do feel it's a hassle, but more than that, I dislike knowing the opponent's hand. I would rather read my opponent's mind, predict the developments, and derive the answers myself.

<b>

There are many times I wonder, "Is there really an answer to this?" but somehow I've managed until now, and I will probably continue to manage in the future.

<b>

"SR-san can overcome things on her own without doing that. Since you're the one being chased, Mika should feel more of a sense of crisis."

<b>

"Ugh... But even in the match streaming comments, they say things like 'Interact more with SR' or 'Please share information about SR'..."

<b>

"Don't forget the pancakes."

<b>

"Huh!? Why!?"

<b>

"Because it's rude to SR-san. Oh, I'm here regardless of what the viewers say, so don't get the wrong idea, okay? Also, if possible, please teach me how to use Byakuren next time."

<b>

I'm not hurt by Crescent's words nor am I angry, but apparently, it seems to be a line that Hime-Suki can't forgive, as she said that.

<b>

Besides, even if she says she wants to learn from me... I’m not boasting, but I hardly have any experience teaching someone, and I don't think I'm particularly good at it.

<b>

And above all, the fact that the other person is a member of the top-ranked group 'Moon' makes me hesitate to nod. Well, before that, I also find it troublesome to interact with people.

<b>

I want to believe that they are not the type of people who say terrible things like those from the company. However, if there is even the slightest risk, I would rather be happy immersing myself in the game alone.

Even though I know that would mean losing out on positive opportunities.

<b>

"I'm fighting solo, unlike Hime-Suki, so I won't be of any reference."

<b>

I said that and, before Crescent or Hime-Suki could say anything, I swiftly tapped the exit button.
