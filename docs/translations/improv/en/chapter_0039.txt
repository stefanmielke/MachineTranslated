# Episode 39: Suzy Cloud Makes Her Stand

The gloomy developments are over.

----------------

<b>

"Ah, ahahaha, I don't think it's going to be easy to keep them alive, you know? Hey? What are you planning to do? These kids are all on the verge of death, aren't they? Hey? Ahahahahahahaha!"

<b>

Doug raised his right hand, laughing, as if signaling something.

<b>

<b>

Suzy stepped forward with a swift movement.

<b>

"Vivi, Irvin, just wait a moment, I'll finish it quickly, okay?"

<b>

As Suzy spoke, she lent a hand to Irvin, who was getting up, and passed by Beatrice, who was supporting him.

Algernon watched from beside Beatrice with a "kikikyu" sound.

<b>

"Su...?"

<b>

Beatrice stared wide-eyed at Suzy's back.

<b>

"......What's wrong... Vivi?"

<b>

Irvin asked Beatrice, who had stopped moving, while enduring the intense pain in his arm.

<b>

"......That kid... is cut off."

<b>

<b>

<b>

The shadow dogs that had attached themselves to the three at the front line suddenly began to run towards Suzy, except for one.

<b>

The last one, without hesitation, sank its fangs into Helena's neck, as if following some command.

<b>

"Aggh! Guuh!!"

"Ah! Th-this guy! Wait... Ugh! Damn!!"

<b>

Helena let out a groan at the sudden sharp pain.

Darna tried to chase after the shadow dog that had bitten Helena, but she couldn't step forward due to the injury in her calf and ended up kneeling.

The shadow dog that had bitten Helena ran off to join the others at the back.

At that moment, Suzy narrowed her eyes as she saw the shadow dog's mouth curl up in a lewd manner.

<b>

"What’s that? Planning to take a hostage?"

<b>

Suzy tilted her head slightly and threw a cold gaze at the shadow dog.

She lifted her chin and advanced. Then, her body swayed gently.

<b>

Suzy's skirt fluttered lightly.

<b>

In the next moment, a sword sprouted beside the mouth of the shadow dog that had bitten Helena.

<b>

A silver blade extended from the left side of the shadow dog's face.

On the opposite side of its face was Suzy's left hand, gripping the sword's hilt.

As Suzy swiftly opened her arm, the shadow dog's upper jaw and head were cleanly severed from its body, as if cutting through a piece of fruit.

The remaining body of the shadow dog, now half its head missing, slowly collapsed.

Suzy caught Helena's body with her right hand to prevent it from falling and pulled it away from the shadow dog's body.

<b>

"Suzy... big sister...?"

"Helena... you did well, great job."

"Su-Suzy, big sister... I-I!"

"It's okay, I'll heal you now."

<b>

The five shadow dogs that had been heading towards Suzy suddenly lost sight of her and began sniffing the ground as if searching for her scent.

But they quickly found their target behind them and started running towards Suzy again.

<b>

<b>

≪Chain Regeneration≫

A skill of the healing class "Great Wiseman."

It connects all allies within a line of vitality centered on oneself, rapidly regenerating HP and continuously restoring vitality for a short time.

<b>

A golden line of light ran across the ground from Suzy, extending to all the children present.

<b>

"Big sister...? W-what is this?!"

<b>

Helena's body was filled with warmth, and her wounds healed and stamina recovered rapidly.

Helena checked her own body and let out a voice of astonishment.

<b>

<b>

The other children also began to recover and stand up.

Darna, Lombard, Karl, Irvin, Colin, Mia, Mary.

Alan, Bernap, Stephan, and all the children from the training ground followed suit.

Only Fiorina and William, who had their blood drained, still did not move.

<b>

<b>

"Whoa! What is this?! My arm can move?!"

"Ah, Irvin? ...Amazing."

<b>

Beatrice exclaimed in surprise as she saw Irvin's arm, which had been repeatedly bitten by the shadow dogs and exposed to the bone, healing beautifully.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ah, huh? Doesn't it hurt? ...Huh?"

"Mia?! I can't believe it... I'm so glad... so glad, Mia... Ah! Uh... um, Mia? You should probably put this on... okay?"

<b>

Mia's side, where she had been stabbed by a black spear, was healing perfectly, but her torn clothing was exposing her skin, and her ample bosom was about to spill out from the torn fabric.

Blushing as she tried to cover it, Willy took off his cape and draped it over Mia's shoulders.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ah! My legs!! This is amazing! I can move so much!"

"Wow! It seems like my strength is coming back!"

<b>

Darna jumped in place, twirling her spear and smashing it into the nose of a shadow dog.

Lombard felt strength return to the hand holding the tower shield.

<b>

<b>

"Can you stand? Can you walk? This is incredible, Su... everyone! Everyone is okay?!"

<b>

At Colin's call, the twins Clark and Ashton, who were receiving treatment at the training ground, along with Charles, Thomas, Layla, and Virgil, all shouted out to confirm their safety.

<b>

Outside the training ground, Karl stood up while checking the places where he had been injured, and Mary wiped the blood from her forehead, surprised to see the wounds had vanished.

<b>

Even on the other side of the stone wall...

<b>

"What happened? ...Huh? What?! Fiorina?! ...Whoa!? Will is here too?! Hey! Bernap! Can you move?!"

"Yeah! No problem. Can you move, Alan?"

"Absolutely no problem! Hey! Stephan! You can move too, right?!"

"Totally fine!!"

"Alright! I don't know what's going on, but it looks like the enemies are standing still! Bernap and I will drag Will away, so Stephan! You take Fiorina! We need to get out of here fast!"

<b>

Bernap and Stephan nodded and began to drag the two who still had their eyes closed out of the area.

<b>

<b>

"This is just a bonus."

<b>

With that, Suzy drew the two swords hanging at her waist and raised both hands above her head.

Holding the swords down like a curtain, she closed her eyes and began to sway her body rhythmically.

And what escaped her lips was...

<b>

"A song? ...Suzy... big sister...? ...!!"

<b>

Helena was astonished by Suzy's appearance, her eyes wide open, when the returning shadow dogs lunged at Suzy.

By the time Helena noticed, the fangs were almost upon Suzy.

The fangs of the shadow dog sank into Suzy's body!

At that moment, the shadow dog's fangs cut through the air uselessly, and its body passed by Suzy without touching her.

All five shadow dogs landed without being able to touch Suzy.

<b>

Neither the shadow dogs nor Helena, who was watching, understood what had just happened.

Still, the shadow dogs lunged again.

But again, they couldn't even graze Suzy.

<b>

Suzy, seemingly unconcerned by the situation, swayed gently, humming a song, and began to dance.

Soon, the children began to hear sounds that were different from the song.

<b>

"Huh? Is that a guitar?"

"Is that a drum sound?"

"An organ?"

"That's a lute, right?"

"I can hear a harp too."

<b>

"A spirit... orchestra?"

<b>

Helena blurted out, turning her gaze back to Suzy.

<b>

Illuminated by the setting sun sinking on the horizon, her fiery red hair shimmered as it danced.

The silver sword cut through the golden light.

In that light, Suzy swayed gracefully, dancing.

Her expression, lit by the sunset, was incredibly gentle and serene, making Helena feel as if she were gazing upon a deity.

Helena's heart was filled with warmth.

<b>

At the same time, she felt strength surging within her body.

Helena's senses were sharper than ever before.

At that moment, she saw a shadow dog preparing to charge again, kicking off the ground.

Helena held two daggers in reverse grip and swiftly slid her body into the line between the shadow dog and Suzy.

<b>

"I won't let you interfere with my big sister...!! You insolent creature!!!"

<b>

Helena shouted as she aimed to smash the shadow dog's fangs with the dagger gripped in her right hand.

<b>

Helena's dagger sliced straight through the shadow dog's lower fangs, severing its lower jaw in one motion.

She then crouched low and dove into the next shadow dog's embrace, extending her body upward and swinging her left dagger inward.

The dagger tore through the shadow dog's abdomen, spilling its innards.

<b>

"What?! Huh? Huh?!"

<b>

Helena couldn't hide her surprise at her own sudden movements and the power of her attack.

At that moment, a sharp flash of a sword gleamed.

It was Irvin's longsword.

<b>

Irvin, confirming that his wounds had healed, picked up the longsword and charged at the shadow dogs surrounding Suzy.

With a swift upward slash, he easily sliced through the shadow dog's abdomen, killing it instantly.

He then swung the longsword down, smashing it into the face of a second shadow dog.

The shadow dog's skull split in two, and it was slain.

<b>

"What the hell is this? Why is it so easy?"

<b>

Irvin also exclaimed in astonishment at the power he wielded.

Suddenly, a loud "bang!" echoed from behind.

Along with it, a large hole appeared in the face of the last shadow dog.

It was Karl's "Fire Bullet" launched from behind.

<b>

"W-what the?! What power is this?!!"

<b>

Karl also raised his voice in surprise.

<b>

<b>

Mary dodged a brutal bat that swooped down and shot an arrow from behind.

The arrows that had barely pierced skin before now struck deeply with penetrating force.

The arrowhead pierced the vital point, shooting down the brutal bat.

Mary was astonished by her own accuracy and the power of her bow.

<b>

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. I, Mia Mattison, daughter of the Matisson connected to Amukam, call upon the water's administrators, the Nymphs. With the power of the flowing water, grant us the strength to vanquish our enemies! ≪Water Cutter≫"

<b>

Mia chanted the incantation, pointing both index fingers at the brutal bat above.

A minuscule stream of water shot straight up from her fingertips.

As Mia moved her fingers apart, the stream of water sliced through the brutal bat hovering above, causing it to fall to the ground like a withered leaf.

<b>

"Wow! What is this? I can reach that far? And take down something that big? Wow!"

<b>

Mia's eyes widened in amazement, and Willy, who was watching beside her, was left speechless.

<b>

<b>

Darna twirled her spear and scooped up a shadow dog from below.

As the shadow dog lost its footing in mid-air, Darna repeatedly thrust her spear into it.

After pulling out the spear that had struck the vital point, she danced it toward the next shadow dog.

<b>

Lombard held his tower shield with one hand, having previously used both hands, and readjusted his grip on the battle axe in his other hand.

He knocked several shadow dogs away with his shield and then smashed the battle axe into the skull of the shadow dog approaching him.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What the hell?! What are these guys?! Why are they suddenly like this?!!"

"That one! That one did something!!"

"Damn it! Lord Olbet is watching! Ah?! You guys! Who said you could move?!!!"

<b>

Doug extended his black spear upon seeing Alan and the others dragging the immobile Will and Fiorina.

<b>

Beatrice, who had been observing the five's movements, noticed Doug extending his black spear.

<b>

"Not good! ≪Stone Wall≫ Protect those kids!!"

<b>

Beatrice's stone wall rose up to protect the five.

It was so thick and radiant, like quartz, that the previous stone walls seemed like flimsy partitions.

The black spear was easily deflected by the wall and scattered into mist.

Beatrice's eyes widened in shock at the strength of the stone wall, "No way..."

<b>

"Whoa! This is bad! Hurry, Bernap! Stephan!"

<b>

Alan shouted to Bernap and Stephan, startled by the suddenly appearing stone wall, urging them to hurry.

"Okay!" the two nodded, and they rolled into the gap in the battle line that Darna had opened.

<b>

<b>

"One more bonus, okay?"

<b>

Once Suzy confirmed that the five had come to the defensive side, she said this, and a ripple of light spread from her.

<b>

≪Vitality Release≫

A skill of the healing class Great Wiseman.

It fully restores the HP and MP of allies around her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Huh? Huh? My magic power... is coming back... no, even more than that?!"

<b>

Colin exclaimed in surprise, realizing not only that his magic power, almost depleted from healing, had fully recovered, but also that his total magic capacity had significantly increased.

It wasn’t just Colin; Beatrice, Willy, Mia, and Karl were also experiencing this. But it wasn’t only the magic users.

The frontline fighters who had been using magic power on their equipment… William included.

<b>

"Uh... where is this? Why...? Am I...?"

<b>

William regained consciousness and was surprised to find no abnormalities in his body.

Moreover, he felt a sense of vitality and energy as if he had taken sufficient rest, even more than that, leaving him bewildered.

<b>

"Will! Will!! You’re awake?! Thank goodness! Will!"

"Colin?! Are you running? Can you stand?! What about your wounds?!!"

<b>

Colin rushed over to William, who had stood up.

William was surprised to see Colin running, but he happily embraced Colin as he jumped into him.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What’s going on? Why can he stand up too?!"

"Damn it...! But unfortunately! The sun has already hidden below the horizon. Time's up!! The playtime is over!!!!"

<b>

Doug swung his right hand vigorously, and the shadows spread out in an instant.

From within, five or six humanoid figures with crocodile-like mouths crawled out.

Furthermore, there were also pale figures with no blood in them.

With red eyes shining, they crawled out of the shadows in a rush.

And from the sky, brutal bats and shadow dogs surged in as reinforcements.

<b>

"W-what's with this number?! No way! Our escape route!!"

<b>

Colin let out a scream-like voice.

<b>

"Su! There's a barrier set up here! We can't get out from here!"

<b>

Beatrice quickly conveyed the situation to Suzy.

<b>

"...A barrier?"

<b>

Suzy looked up suspiciously and swung her right sword upward as if to slice through the sky.

<b>

Immediately, a crack of light appeared in the space above.

With a sound like shattering glass, the barrier shattered and disappeared.

Everyone present, both enemies and allies, looked up at the sky, their eyes wide in shock.

<b>

<b>

"W-what the hell?! What did she just do?!!!"

"I don't know! I have no idea!! What the hell is going on?!!!"

<b>

<b>

Immediately, Suzy kicked off the ground and jumped.

In the direction of the destroyed school building.

Arcing high into the air.

<b>

"Did Suzy just jump?!!"

"What the hell?! Why can't I see her?!!"

<b>

Irvin's voice of surprise rang out.

He heard Alan's ominous shout afterward, but decided to ignore it when he heard the sound of a beating.

<b>

<b>

Suzy rotated her body vertically while jumping, checking the ground below as she faced downward.

<b>

(Vampires... two Elder Vampires. From their shadows, Shadow Ghouls? Seven from each shadow, I suppose? And the white one is a Lesser Vampire? The weaker ones are swarming in. I want to use an area attack, but... if it reaches everyone, it would be too dangerous. I guess I’ll have to pop them off one by one... The dogs and bats are also gathering, but with those kids now, I can treat them as weaklings, so I'll leave that to everyone♪)

<b>

In an instant, she thought that much and drew her two swords again, aiming the sword tips toward the ground, and began to unleash sword energy at the "white target."

The Lesser Vampires burst one after another.

The two Vampires had no time to comprehend what was happening.

Before they knew it, all the minions they had raised had vanished.

<b>

"W-what? What the hell? What is this?!!"

<b>

Doug shouted in confusion, searching for the minions that should have been there, looking around frantically.

Suzy tilted her head, looking down at Doug with a displeased expression.

"Grooooaaar...!!" With a final deathly groan, all the shadow ghouls dissipated into mist and vanished.

<b>

"What the hell?! What the hell is going on?! What happened here?! Who the hell are you?!"

<b>

Doug, clearly confused, shouted loudly as he searched for his subordinates who should have been there, repeatedly looking around.

Suzie tilted her head, frowning in annoyance.

<b>

"You've been noisy since earlier."

<b>

Before he knew it, Suzy stood right in front of Doug and swung her right sword horizontally.

<b>

"Wha?! B-buh?!"

<b>

The vampire known as Doug exploded on the spot.

White salt-like particles scattered.

They dissolved into the atmosphere, erasing his existence.

<b>

"Doug?! W-what?! What are you?! What did you do?!!!"

<b>

Eliza immediately jumped back from the spot, her hands transforming into claws as she shouted...

<b>

"That's why I said, you're noisy."

<b>

Before he knew it, Suzy stood behind Eliza and swung her left sword upward.

<b>

"Boah?!"

<b>

The vampire called Eliza also scattered into white particles and vanished.

<b>

"I have no intention of holding back against you."

<b>

With that cold gaze, Suzy glared into the void and sheathed her two swords at her waist.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When Suzy returned to everyone, the twins Clark and Ashton were holding Fiorina, worriedly calling out to her repeatedly.

<b>

"Fiorina is the only one who hasn't regained consciousness."

<b>

Colin said, pouring healing magic into Fiorina while anxiously conveying this to Suzy.

<b>

Suzy was informed that Fiorina had her blood drained by a vampire.

Today, she learned from Henry that a vampire's victim loses part of their astral body and manas.

Until the vampire that took part of their soul is destroyed, the captured soul cannot be freed...

<b>

The depletion of the astral body should have been restored through MP recovery via mana charge.

In fact, William, who had purely lost blood, lost consciousness due to MP depletion, and was revived with HP and MP fully restored by ≪Vitality Release≫.

The manas should also have been taken by the vampire that had been destroyed.

The soul should be freed.

If she wasn't regaining consciousness, it meant that the connection was not restored?

If so, it would mean that if she could restore the connection between the body and the soul, she could resurrect her.

Suzy thought this.

<b>

<b>

【Resurrection】

Suzy did not believe that she could resurrect the dead in this world.

There exists a resurrection magic called ≪Resurrection≫ that brings someone back from a state of incapacitation in the game, and she can use it.

However, she could hardly believe that the incapacitation in the game could be equated with death in this world.

What if the incapacitation in the game was akin to being unconscious in this world?

If one regains consciousness, they can return to battle once more.

Just like how Will was doing right now!

What if the magic called ≪Resurrection≫ was merely that?

If someone were to meet an untimely death, she would not be able to bring them back!

It would be reasonable to think that way.

<b>

Until now, Suzy had never considered testing ≪Resurrection≫.

Waiting for someone to die, or using it after someone dies, what if it didn’t work out?

Just thinking about it sent shivers down her spine.

That’s why she panicked so much when she felt Sonia might lose her life.

There is no guarantee of bringing someone back to life, and people do not come back after they die.

That is a given.

<b>

But what if this ≪Resurrection≫ was a magic that could restore the connection of the soul? If so, using it might allow Fiorina to wake up immediately.

The connection between the body and manas might be thin or weak, but it shouldn't be severed.

Once, Henry-sensei couldn't save Ravi because her manas was still captured.

Now, Fiorina should not have that concern.

Whether or not she could resurrect the dead is uncertain.

But Fiorina is still alive!

Then, it’s worth a try, let’s give it a shot!

<b>

<b>

Suzy knelt beside Fiorina, raised one hand, and activated the magic.

<b>

≪Resurrection≫

<b>

Light overflowed from Suzy's palm.

The warm light enveloped Fiorina's entire body.

Gradually, the light melted into Fiorina, disappearing.

<b>

With a sigh, Suzy stood up.

Fiorina, who had her eyes closed, began to twitch and slowly opened her eyelids.

<b>

"Fiorina!!"

<b>

Clark and Ashton called out to Fiorina in unison.

Fiorina opened her eyes in surprise.

<b>

"Huh? What? Why? How?"

"I'm so glad! I'm so glad, Fiorina! I'm so glad...!!"

<b>

Colin took Fiorina from the twins and hugged her tightly.

Fiorina was just bewildered, saying "Huh? What?" repeatedly.

After confirming everyone's relieved expressions and exhaling a deep sigh of relief, Suzy turned her sharp gaze to the north.

<b>

"What’s wrong?! Su!"

<b>

Beatrice noticed Suzy's gaze and asked.

<b>

"There are still about 20 or 30 coming this way, more and more."

"Eh?!"

<b>

At those words, not only Beatrice but all the children present were taken aback.

The new stone wall Beatrice had erected was powerful, and the shadow dogs were struggling to break through.

Even so, some were still leaping over.

Darna and Lombard were still dealing with them.

From the sky, Mary was shooting down bats with her bow, along with the two magic users.

<b>

"But with everyone now, they’re just weaklings, so it’s fine. The enchantment will last for another hour, so there’s no problem. Plus..."

<b>

Suzy raised her right hand above her head and snapped her fingers.

<b>

"Come, World Tree!!"

<b>

A huge seed-like object descended rapidly from the sky and plunged into the ground.

It quickly opened its outer skin, revealing a trunk that extended branches, instantly becoming a young tree.

<b>

≪Summon Yggdrasil≫

A skill of the Great Wiseman.

Summoning a young World Tree to give life to those under its shade.

<b>

"If you stay at the base of this tree, even if you're injured, you'll heal quickly, and your magic power will recover."

"Eh?! What? What is this? What is this? Su-chan!"

<b>

Mia's eyes widened as she rushed to Suzy.

<b>

"I summoned a young ash tree. This one will be here for about an hour, so it’s fine, okay?"

<b>

Suzy replied nonchalantly.

S-summoning magic in an instant? Beatrice rolled her eyes in disbelief, her mouth agape.

<b>

"So, everyone, just hold on a little longer."

"Are you planning to do something?!"

<b>

After regaining her composure, Beatrice asked Suzy.

<b>

"Yeah, since it's endless, I'll cut off the source."

<b>

Suzy tilted her chin and glared into the depths of the forest, which were not visible from here.

<b>

"Will, Lombard, Bernap, protect everyone."

"Darna, Irvin, Alan, take them down."

"Mia, Karl, Mary, shoot the enemies."

"Willy, Colin, Vivi, please take care of everyone."

<b>

Suzy called out to each of them.

<b>

"Su-nee! I can fight too!"

"Yeah, I know you can, Stephan. With Helena, okay?"

"Leave it to me, big sister! I’ll protect everyone!"

"Okay, Helena, I’m counting on you."

<b>

Suzy patted Stephan's head and smiled at Helena.

"I'll protect you!" Stephan declared, puffing out his chest, while Helena proudly snorted.

<b>

"We can fight too!" Clark and Ashton chimed in.

"Then you guys go over there," Lombard said, dragging the twins along.

<b>

"Su-chan!!"

"Mupugyu!"

<b>

Mia hugged Suzy tightly.

<b>

"Thank you, thank you! Su-chan!"

"No, Mia, it must have hurt, right? I'm sorry for being late."

"I'm fine! I'm fine! But Su-chan, are you okay on your own?"

"Yeah, I’m fine. So Mia, wait here with everyone, okay?"

<b>

Suzy placed her hand on Mia's waist and gently spoke while looking into her eyes.

<b>

"Su, thank you. Can you really go alone?"

"Yeah, I’m fine, Colin. So Colin, please take care of everyone."

"Then I’ll leave it to you! You’ll finish quickly, right?!"

"Yeah! Leave it to me, Vivi. I’ll wrap it up in less than 30 minutes, okay?"

"I’m counting on you, Su! I’m leaving it to you!!"

"Yeah! Darna! I’m counting on you!!"

<b>

Darna raised her right fist and shouted, and Suzy raised her right fist in response.

<b>

"Okay, I’m off, everyone. I’ll be back soon, okay?"

"Go, Su! And take them down quickly!!"

<b>

At Beatrice's words, Suzy nodded with a big smile.

She kicked off the ground and started running towards the northern forest.

At that moment, a shadow dog jumped out from above the stone wall in front of her.

Suzy cut it down in passing with a flurry of strikes and increased her speed as she ran into the forest.

The children watching let out gasps of admiration.

<b>

"Alright! Everyone! If Su gets back and these guys are still not taken care of, we won't be able to face her!"

<b>

Beatrice shouted to everyone.

"Whoa!!" The children's battle cries echoed around them, shaking the ground.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suzy ran straight into the forest towards several extermination targets.

Along the way, she crushed any dogs or bats that caught her eye.

<b>

(First, the ones giving orders. Evil Werewolves and Evil Werebats. How considerate to put "Evil" in their names! It's so obvious! These guys are definitely the ones giving commands to the dogs and bats, unifying their will. If I take them down, they'll just be a rabble. And the most dangerous one is this "Evil Wrat." This one is bad! But first, I’ll quickly take down the dogs and bats!!)

<b>

She heard a "kikyu" sound from her shoulder.

<b>

"Algernon, are you okay? Aren't you supposed to be by Vivi's side?"

<b>

Kikikikyu! No problem! the rodent chirped.

<b>

"Then it’s dangerous to be outside, so stay in here, okay?"

<b>

As she pointed to her chest with her finger, the rodent chirped and burrowed into her chest.

<b>

"Ah! N-no, don’t move too much, okay?"

<b>

Kikyu? the rodent chirped. Even in this situation, Suzy blushed slightly. As expected of her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suzy plunged into the forest.

As she got closer to her target, the number of shadow dogs increased, but it didn't matter. She sliced through them all and pressed on.

Blood and flesh were scattered throughout the forest, but Suzy skillfully avoided the splatter, and not a single stain marred her attire.

Then, she spotted her target.

<b>

(I found it! Evil Werewolf!!)

<b>

A black wolf standing on two legs, reaching a height of two meters.

Before it could even recognize Suzy, it was easily slashed to pieces and turned into blood and flesh as she passed by.

Suzy spun gracefully on the spot, coming to a stop.

At the same time, the surviving shadow dogs around her also turned into blood and flesh, scattering away.

Suzy looked up at the western sky.

In her line of sight were the bats swarming above.

Among them, she could see one particularly large individual.

<b>

(I've confirmed the Evil Werebat! Should I blow them all away... It’s in the sky, so it should be fine, right?)

<b>

Suzy aimed her sword tip at the target and unleashed her skill.

<b>

≪Impact Storm≫

A long-range area attack skill of the Duel Barbarian.

<b>

With a low explosion sound, the target werebat was blown away along with the surrounding bats.

Only black dust could be seen swirling in the space where the skill had detonated.

And one more thing.

Aiming carefully at a target floating a little further away, Suzy concentrated her "ki" and took aim.

<b>

"Explode, will you...?"

<b>

With her "ki" finely tuned, she released it toward the target.

The target was blown apart at the lower half, spiraling down to the ground.

Satisfied, she let out a "yes!" as she exhaled through her nose.

She seemed pleased with her exquisite control over her "ki."

<b>

Now, it was time for the most important target! Just as she was about to move from that spot, she noticed multiple presences approaching her.

<b>

(Is that... the Shadow Ghouls I blew away at the school? They're coming straight for me? There are quite a few... Huh? Are there Elder Vampires too? Are those the ones from the school? Four in total... Seriously! This isn't the time to be dealing with this!!)

<b>

Hmph! she thought, placing her hands on her hips and exhaling through her nose.

With a swift motion, she swung her sword, dispersing the approaching Shadow Ghouls with a wave of "ki."

She then aimed her sword tip at the approaching vampires and unleashed sword energy.

One, two, three. She shot them down in quick succession.

The last one was close enough, so she dashed in and swung her sword, blowing it apart.

<b>

"Alright, that’s done! Seriously! I wasted extra time on this!"

<b>

Suzy immediately started running toward the location of her final targets.

And it became clear quickly.

<b>

<b>

As she got closer, a rustling sound echoed around her, like a massive chorus.

A suffocating stench of beasts filled the forest.

It was not just staining the forest floor black; it was a massive pulsating black mass, overlapping and spilling over, writhing restlessly.

And within that mass were countless red, flickering lights.

<b>

Mad Lemmings.

About 30 centimeters long. Larger than Algernon by one or two sizes.

With pitch-black fur and crazily burning red eyes, their fangs were long and sharp. They could easily tear through children's leather armor.

The number was approximately twelve thousand.

They were waiting for orders to avalanche into the village, writhing restlessly.

And the one giving those orders was...

<b>

(You! Evil Wrat!!!)

<b>

Just as she was about to charge at her target.

<b>

Kikikikikyu! The rodent was thrashing around in Suzy's clothes.

<b>

"Ah! No! Don't move... okay?!"

<b>

Suzie’s legs gave out, and she collapsed to the ground.

<b>

"Ah! Nn… you dummy! Nn!! Algernon, nn! I told you… not to move… didn’t I? Nn!"

<b>

Kikikikyu?!

<b>

"Th-That’s why! If you move… we’ll get caught!! Nn!!"

<b>

From Suzie’s trembling chest, Algernon crawled out and poked his head out, chittering “kikikikyu-kyuu” as if trying to convey something.

<b>

"Geez… wait, you knew these guys were here… nn, and you still came along, didn’t you? So why are you panicking now?"

<b>

Slightly blushing and breathing heavily, Suzie questioned Algernon.

<b>

"Kikikikyu-kyuuuu… kikyu!"

<b>

"Huh? You didn't expect there to be this many? It was beyond your expectations?"

<b>

Kikikikikyu!!

<b>

"Too dangerous? You want to hurry and escape with everyone?"

<b>

Kikikikikyu!!

<b>

"You came because it was dangerous! If you're scared, go home now!"

<b>

Kikikikyu!

<b>

"Then stay quiet and stay inside! Don't move! You can come back and play slowly next time, okay?"

<b>

Kikikyu?

<b>

"Ah, um... anyway! Don't move! Got it?"

<b>

Kikikyu!

<b>

"Then I'm off!"

<b>

Suzy stood up, clapping her hands to reset her focus.

She then gripped her two swords again and started running toward her target.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The massive number of Mad Lemmings was forming a small mountain of black, climbing over each other, writhing ominously.

<b>

If this horde were unleashed upon the village, it would be uncontrollable.

Even if she exterminated them one by one, she couldn't imagine how long it would take.

<b>

Now was the perfect opportunity while they were gathered.

If she could wipe them out now, there would be no problem.

However, if she used an area skill to exterminate this many, she couldn't imagine how much power it would unleash.

She was certain it would definitely affect the village.

Images of mountains crumbling flashed in her mind, causing her to shudder.

<b>

She wouldn't use an area skill!

But the plan to exterminate them remained unchanged.

She would handle it in a place that would minimize damage to the forest.

Fortunately, there was a suitable location nearby.

First, she would lead them there.

<b>

Suzy accelerated and jumped.

She leaped just over the black mountain, and at that moment, she unleashed her skill.

<b>

≪Spread Hate≫

A skill of the shield class "Sentinel Knight."

It provokes surrounding enemies, forcing them to target her.

<b>

Until then, the black mass had been moving somewhat steadily, but after receiving the skill, it exploded and surged wildly.

Suzy used another skill against their commander.

<b>

≪Bind with Chain≫

Also a skill of the "Sentinel Knight."

It draws the target in with chains, making them the target of attacks.

<b>

Just before landing, Suzy captured the Evil Wrat with chains and pulled it toward her.

She carelessly grabbed its head and began to run.

The Evil Wrat shouted angrily at Suzy.

<b>

The Evil Wrat was the commander of the Mad Lemmings.

If she took its hate, the targets of this horde would inevitably turn to her.

Suzy continued to provoke the Wrat while dragging it along, using single-target ≪Hate≫.

<b>

Suzy ran through the forest like that.

Soon, she arrived at an open area.

A space about 30 meters in diameter spread out before her, the same place where Suzy and Howard had first met, one of the battle points set up in this forest.

This place was a bit larger than others. This is where she would settle things.

<b>

Holding tightly to the wrat's head, she jumped up between the trees and soared into the center of the clearing.

With that momentum, she slammed the wrat's head into the ground.

<b>

"You will be buried here!!"

<b>

The Wrat's head sank into the ground, struggling in panic but unable to do anything.

Soon, the black mass surged like a tsunami.

As the front line entered the clearing, Suzy cast ≪Spread Hate≫ once more.

The black wave surged angrily, pulsating wildly.

It seemed as if the wave was trying to crush Suzy.

But Suzy quickly jumped back from the center of the clearing to the edge.

She waited for the black wave to catch up to her and began to run counterclockwise along the outer perimeter.

<b>

As Suzy ran, the massive wave chased after her, swirling around the clearing.

Suzy adjusted her speed to avoid being left behind or caught up too quickly.

Eventually, the black wave caught up, and she began to shrink the radius of her run.

As she crushed the Mad Lemmings beneath her feet, Suzy continued to run.

Some tried to cling to her ankles, but they couldn't even graze her.

<b>

Eventually, by gradually reducing the running radius, the clearing began to turn into a vortex of black.

Suzy reached the center where the Evil Wrat was buried and kicked off the ground, leaping into the air.

The crushed Wrat was buried along with the deeply sunken ground.

The Mad Lemmings around were blown away by the impact, creating a donut-shaped hole in the black vortex.

But they quickly began to pursue Suzy, climbing over their fallen comrades and ascending, forming a towering vortex.

<b>

As Suzy reached an altitude of 30 to 40 meters, the vortex rose like a tornado.

It resembled a black Tower of Babel.

<b>

As she neared the peak, her ascent slowed, and Suzy looked down at the black vortex.

Alright! It’s mostly contained within the clearing!

She drew one of her swords with her right hand, gathering magic power and pointing it toward the center of the vortex.

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. I, Suzy Cloud, daughter of Howard Cloud and Sonia Cloud, call upon the great fire guide Salamander. With that flame, grant me the power to vanquish my enemies! ≪Fire Bullet≫"

<b>

This was not her own attack magic but the incantation for the spirit magic she had learned here.

The magic she used was the same basic fireball spell that Karl had used.

However, the amount of magic power used for this was on a completely different level. The magic power unleashed was extraordinary.

The fireball that manifested exceeded five meters in diameter.

With a roar, the dense mass of flames shot forth, instantly incinerating the black tower and sweeping the ground clean.

The fireball gouged out an area of about 50 meters square, turning it to ashes.

<b>

".........................."

<b>

As Suzy descended and looked at the ground, she bit her lip, breaking out in a cold sweat.

<b>

"Did I... go overboard?"

<b>

When she landed on the ground, Algernon popped out of her chest, excitedly chirping, "Kikikikikyu! Kikyu kikyu kikyu!!"

<b>

"Ugh! No! I told you not to move! ...Right?!"

<b>

Suzy pressed her chest and collapsed.

<b>

"Kikikikikyu! Kikikikikyu! Kikikikikyu! Kikikikikyu! Kikikikikyu! Kikikikikyu! Kikikikikyu! Kikikikikyu!"

Amazing! That was instantaneous for such a huge horde! You're incredible, Sis! From now on, let me be your little brother! I’ll follow you anywhere, Sis!!!

<b>

"What? I didn’t quite catch what you just said... but it felt oddly servile, was that just my imagination?"

<b>

Still slightly out of breath, Suzy looked down at Algernon with a frown.

Algernon chirped back, "Kikikikikyu!" as if laughing, looking up at Suzy.

<b>

"Oh no! I need to clean up the last bit! There are quite a few dogs and bats scattered throughout the village, so I need to take care of them!"

<b>

“Kikyuu!” chirped the eager rodent in response.

<b>

Suzie tucked Algernon back into her chest and began moving.

Her target was likely the main culprit she had shot down and left behind earlier.

When she tagged him, she realized he was a "True Vampire."

"I think that means progenitor, right?" Suzie pondered.

<b>

(I’d love to quickly take down any scoundrel attacking this village, but since he’s a True Vampire, he must have been around a long time. So, I should pull as much information out of him as I can!)

<b>

She was able to find him immediately.

He was emitting an unsettling aura, spreading it around like sewage from a sprinkler.

To Suzie, it was as if he were spraying contaminated water everywhere.

<b>

"Ugh, that’s so gross."

<b>

That was Suzie's reaction when she spotted him writhing on the ground.

It wasn’t his appearance—

it was the aura he emitted, filled with a filthy, defiling sensation, as if spreading garbage around.

<b>

"Are you the ringleader?"

<b>

Suzie looked down at him with a frown, her expression twisted with disgust.

His aura was so vile that it felt like looking at waste, making it hard to keep her gaze on him.

<b>

"What the hell are you?! What did you do?! What did you do to those kids?!"

<b>

The vampire bared his fangs, veins bulging as he glared up at Suzie.

<b>

"What did I do? You attacked, so I just smacked you down, that’s all."

<b>

Suzie responded as if to say, What’s this guy even talking about?

<b>

"Anyway, I have something I want to ask you."

<b>

She waved her hand dismissively, showing she didn’t care about his grievances.

<b>

"Do you know something called a Child Eater?"

<b>

The vampire’s eyes widened, looking up at Suzie in shock.

<b>

"Are you serious?"

<b>

Suzie’s brow furrowed in irritation.

<b>

"So, do you know, or don’t you? If not, then that’s fine."

"Don’t mock me! I am Orbet Mash! I am the exalted being you lowly humans call the ‘Child Eater’!!"

<b>

Suzie furrowed her brows even more, looking down at the creature sprawled on the ground, emitting an aura like filth.

<b>

"Or… bet? Exalted? …Ew… I didn’t know your name… but so, you’re the one… I see."

"Damn it! What’s going on?! Those kids are nowhere to be found! Why won’t my body regenerate?! Damn it! You! What have you done to me?!"

<b>

Orbet’s lower body, shattered by Suzie, continued to emit wisps of white smoke, crumbling little by little without repair.

<b>

"You… damn it! My body! You lowly human! What did you do to me?! You humans are nothing more than our ‘sustenance’! Know your place, you filthy human!! Damn it!"

<b>

"…Hmm."

<b>

Suzie relaxed her shoulders, lowering her twin blades as she swayed slightly, narrowing her eyes and gazing coldly at Orbet.

<b>

"What’s with that look? How dare you?! What’s wrong with the people of this village?! First that old man, and now you, acting above your station! Just you wait! I’ll heal this wound right now, and I’ll make you my sustenance myself! Be honored! Oh, and your hair is red too, huh? Haha! Reminds me of a girl I once devoured from this village! You better satisfy me as well as she did! Hahaha! After you, it’ll be that old man! I’ll tear that arrogant old man apart! Ahahaha!"

<b>

"So you’re the one, then. And now I’m sure you’re no better than a pig. Also… I see, Howard Papa…"

<b>

Suzie took her gaze off Orbet, looking off into the distance with a softened, affectionate expression.

<b>

"W-What?! Don’t mock me! Comparing me to a pig, you worthless insect! Damn it! Why?! Why won’t my body regenerate?! Damn it, damn it! What did you do?! Was it some priest’s spell?! What are you?! I’ve never heard of anyone like you! Who are you?!"

<b>

As Suzie sheathed her swords,

<b>

"Me? I am Suzie Cloud… daughter of Howard Cloud and Sonia Cloud. That’s right… I am Suzie Cloud! Their daughter! Suzie Cloud!!"

<b>

Suzie proudly declared her name,

her face filled with joy and satisfaction.

With a kikyuu, the small rodent peeked out from her chest, looking up at her proud expression.

<b>

<b>

"W-What is she talking about…?"

<b>

Orbet muttered in confusion.

Narrowing her eyes at him, Suzie continued, exasperated, as if telling him to finally realize the truth.

<b>

"People don’t come back once they’re dead. Wounds on a dead body… don’t heal, you know?"

<b>

"Didn’t you know that?" Suzie informed Orbet.

<b>

"W-What are you saying?! I am undead! An immortal who has transcended death! Such trivial human notions are beneath me! I am the ruler of the night!"

<b>

Suzie shrugged, letting out a sigh of disbelief.

<b>

"Oh, really? You’re just following the laws of nature, aren’t you? Besides…"

<b>

She pointed off into the distance, saying, "Over there," then dashed toward Orbet, and with all her might…

<b>

Bam!

<b>

She kicked him, sending his body flying in an arc into the forest.

<b>

"G-Guh!!"

<b>

Orbet’s body traced an arc and disappeared into the forest beyond.

<b>

"No matter how strong you think you are, I can’t imagine you standing a chance against Howard Papa! Not even for a second!"

<b>

With her hands on her hips and a defiant frown, she declared to the now-absent Orbet.

<b>

"Alright! Time to clean up! There are dogs and bats scattered all over the village, so we’ll need to deal with that!"

<b>

With her hands on her hips, she turned back and murmured.

The rodent peeked out from her chest and chirped in agreement.

<b>

"By the time I finish cleaning up, Howard Dad should be done too, so I need to reward him!"

<b>

Kikikyu!

<b>

"Then we’ll return to school and everyone’s place, Algernon!"

<b>

Algernon chirped happily.

Suzy dashed out of the forest and back into the village.
