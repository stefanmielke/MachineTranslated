# Episode 14: Suzy and the Cloud Family

From Suzy's perspective.

----------------

<b>

I ran while crying!

I jumped, ran, and charged in while crying, hitting everything in sight!!

<b>

"Uhi~~~~~n! What the heck is with this number!? Pueh! There are four digits… huh!? Tii!! Run… buh! They're circling around… nuriya! Not a chance!! Upah! Damn itーーーー!! Nuhn! Fish!! Tou! I'm so hungry~~~~~!! Upii! What the hell… chei! There are so many… get lost! Toa! Whose… pukya! fault is this… kunu! Huh!? Owata! It's me… gupop! It's me! Uraaa! Is it me!! Ueeeee~~~~~n!!"

<b>

<b>

The number is roughly several hundred!

I can't do area attacks with my skills.

They're not all in a straight line, and the forest is full of obstacles.

I can only take them down one by one.

At first, I was using dual blades to smash them down, but...

<b>

Huh? Wouldn't it be better to use my hands and feet together?

And while I'm at it, wouldn't it be more efficient to smash rocks and shoot finger bullets?

<b>

Thinking that, I started to punch and kick with bare hands, flying around.

<b>

As a result, I charged in recklessly, crashing into bushes, branches, rocky surfaces, and the ground, getting splattered with blood, and it became quite a terrible sight.

My 'Village Girl's Everyday Clothes' are in tatters! Sniff sniff...

<b>

<b>

After about an hour, I exterminated the mobs over a wide area with a radius of 10 kilometers.

<b>

"How about that, you bastard! It's mostly cleaned up, right!? ...Damn it, I've come to a point less than a kilometer from the human settlement. That was close... Oh, there are still a few ahead. Ue! There are people too! This is bad!!"

<b>

<b>

In a panic, I flew towards the mobs I had missed and found a cleared area in the forest.

There, a two-headed snake was facing off against an old man.

<b>

"Whoa! First villager spotted! But that's not the point! There's another snake, and about ten wolves... It's a pack! They're trying to surround the old man, huh? Not on my watch!"

<b>

<b>

I immediately moved in, punching the wolves one after another and crushing them with finger bullets.

<b>

"These guys think they're hiding their presence, but they're completely visible! Oh! The old man is amazing! He sliced that snake in no time!! Ah! Damn it! One got away! Shit!!"

<b>

After defeating one snake, the old man also slashed down the wolf that jumped in...

<b>

"That old man really knows what he's doing... Ah, but his movements... Is it poison!? This is bad! Damn it, hurry up!!"

<b>

Right now, I was looking down from a tree at the area where the old man and the snake were.

The old man and the snake were almost in the center of the area.

I was looking at them from the side.

For now, I broke a nearby branch and threw it between the old man and the snake with a "tei!"

<b>

"Whoa, a clean cut, that's amazing... Huh, the last little dog is aiming for the old man from the opposite side of the area... I need to get rid of the poison too, or it’ll be bad... I have no choice!"

<b>

Honestly, I wanted to avoid contact with the locals as much as possible, and if I were to enter a human settlement, I wanted to be more cautious... but right now, that's not a situation I can afford to think about!

I hurriedly jumped down from the tree, approached the old man, and after saying a word, I lifted him up.

<b>

Alright, let's evacuate to the opposite side of the wolves... Huh? Why does he look surprised? Did I say something weird?

Well, whatever, I need to let him rest in the shade for now!

<b>

I laid the old man down in the shade and quickly returned to the sword that was left in the center.

<b>

Alright, you little dog, you've changed your target to me.

After all, it seems like defeating them in front of the old man with bare hands or my own weapon would stand out too much!

<b>

With this weapon, I could slice the snake too, so it should be fine, right?

From the looks of it, it seems to be a mid-tier zero rank?

Even with a weapon of this level, if I wrap it with 'Ki', I can do that much.

<b>

The old man was definitely putting 'Ki' into it!

Huh? ...Does that mean the people here can use 'Ki' too?

<b>

While holding the sword and thinking about that, a wolf suddenly jumped at me.

I sliced it cleanly in half!

<b>

When I quickly returned to the old man... Oh no! The poison is progressing quite a bit!

I need to hurry! But what should I do? Using a high-level healing skill would definitely be overkill, and it would be flashy...

<b>

Should I try combining the initial detoxification magic with 'Ki'? ...That would be discreet and not stand out, right?

First, I'll get rid of the poison! I'll think about treatment afterward, depending on the condition of the wounds!!

<b>

Kneeling beside the old man, I placed my palm on the wound on his leg and began to chant the detoxification magic while flowing in 'Ki'.

<b>

Whoa! This feels good! I can feel my 'Ki' enveloping the old man... Oh? The wound is healing too!

It seems like the recovery element of the detoxification magic is linked to cell activation... or something like that?

It sounds a bit forced, but haha!

<b>

Oh, the old man looks happy too♪

...Huh? What? Not an ordinary person? Huh? Slicing and detoxifying? Not normal?

No wayyy!?

<b>

<b>

Still, I can understand what he's saying.

The words the old man is using are the same as the armor I saw above. It's a language I don't know, but I can understand what he's saying.

It's a strange feeling. I can hear it, but it feels like I'm searching for words to speak? Am I pronouncing it correctly?

<b>

Ah, Howard Cloud... right? Hello! It's Suzy.

Huh? Auror? I don't understand.

<b>

Y-yes? Where did I come from? Um... over there, I guess...

Uhi~~~~~n! Don't get so excited! It's not good for your blood pressure!

Parents? I don't have any~~! I'm sorry for being alone~~~~!!

<b>

<b>

Kuuuuuuuuuu...

<b>

<b>

!! Hagu... what an impatient stomach I have! And why now!?

Ahh... Ahh! Don't look at me with those eyes!

It's too embarrassing!! I'm so sorry!!

<b>

<b>

Huh? W-what did you just say?

Food? Cooking? Plenty?

What a violently attractive phrase! My life just got cut down in an instant!!

<b>

Whaaat!? S-salt, you say!? Half... a portion?

Guhahh! Are you kidding me?! Are you here to finish me off!?

Uwaaaaa! My mouth is flooding!!

<b>

Is it okay? Can I visit your place? Won't it be a bother? Am I not intruding? What about your family's lunch?

If someone suddenly says something so kind in a place I don't know, I might just burst into tears!!

<b>

Honestly, it’s probably outrageous for a girl (who looks like this) to go to a man's house she just met...

But I can't help it! I have no confidence to resist such temptation!!

<b>

Please! It's okay, right? You won't let me go? Take me to eat! Fly me to the food!!

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

When I arrived at Mr. Cloud's carriage outside the forest, I was surprised!

<b>

I thought it would be a horse since they said it was a carriage... but it wasn't a horse.

Mr. Cloud calls this a "horse," but...

The silhouette is indeed a "horse."

<b>

But it has scales, right? And hooves? Or claws? No, hooves? It looks like clawed hooves! I know that hooves originally evolved from claws...

<b>

The face also... it has no ears, right? The teeth are sharp too... this face looks like a lizard, right?

But the mane and tail are horse-like... It's a mysterious creature!

<b>

Well, I guess this is what they call a "horse" in this world.

This is definitely an unfamiliar world...

<b>

<b>

Listening to Mr. Cloud's story, it seems that this place is a country called Auror, in a village called Amukamu.

<b>

If you go south about 20 kilometers from here, there's a town called Coop Town, and he said you can get there in about an hour with this carriage, so it must be able to go at the speed of a mama bicycle?

<b>

If you go further south for 300 kilometers, you can reach a city called Dekember, which is one of the twelve cities.

Moreover, if you go another 1200 kilometers south, there’s the "Royal Capital"!

<b>

The Royal Capital!! Where the king is! It's fantasy!

But from here, it's a one-way distance of 1500 kilometers.

That’s the distance of traveling across the length of Honshu.

<b>

Even a super-powered man who can run at 100 kilometers per hour would take 15 hours.

It's not a distance you can casually travel...

<b>

<b>

While on the carriage, I was repeatedly asked how I got here, but I could only answer that I was in the forest before I knew it.

<b>

Because that's the truth!

<b>

This Amukamu Forest, also known as the Iroshio Great Forest (or so I've been told), is home to many magical beasts, and it seems it's not a place for a girl like me to be alone.

<b>

...It seems that Mr. Cloud has been treating me like a child since we met...

I think this body is an adult... Is there a discrepancy in perception from my perspective as a Japanese person?

<b>

By the way, magical beasts refer to what I see as mobs.

Here, they seem to call them magical beasts.

And the snakes and wolves I saw earlier are originally creatures that inhabit deeper areas above the mid-level, and it's an abnormal situation for them to appear so close to a village.

<b>

I felt a cold sweat running down my back.

I replied that it sounds serious, but did my face not twitch?

It's a big deal, isn't it?

<b>

Also, those snakes were quite shallow too... I wanted to make an excuse, but I couldn't say that.

<b>

<b>

As we talked, the carriage moved forward, and I enjoyed the scenery of the village along the way.

<b>

I've never lived in the countryside, and I've only seen such pastoral scenery from the train window, so experiencing it this way for the first time was a bit moving.

<b>

The surface of the Hojisun Pond (that's what I was told it was called), which is a bit too big to be called a pond, reflected the woodland and sparkled in the sunlight.

<b>

The street lined with poplar trees seemed like a calendar photo, perfectly matching the blue of the sky!

<b>

The undulating land with wheat fields stretching to the horizon made me sigh without realizing it.

<b>

Mr. Cloud was watching me with an amused expression as I took in the scenery.

Please stop! Don't look at me with those eyes like I'm a small animal!!

It's so embarrassing!

<b>

By the way, the harvest will start all at once next week, so it seems this is the only time to see this scenery.

Did I come at a good time?

<b>

<b>

<b>

As we were talking, we arrived at the Cloud residence.

<b>

It was located on a slightly hilly area, surrounded by windbreak trees.

It was an L-shaped building with white walls.

It was long from east to west, with a section jutting out south from the east side.

<b>

The roof had a two-tiered angle that changed midway.

What do you call this kind of roof?

<b>

The recessed part of the L has an awning, making it a terrace.

This side is the south side.

<b>

There was a magnificent door on the gable side of the west side on the first floor.

This must be the entrance.

<b>

In front of that entrance stood a woman.

I think she is Mr. Cloud's wife.

She looks to be in her 50s, with shimmering grayish-green eyes and beautifully styled chestnut brown hair gathered lightly on top of her head.

<b>

She looks like a kind lady with a refined demeanor.

<b>

<b>

When Mr. Cloud stopped the carriage and helped me down by taking my hand, I thought,

"Whoa! Mr. Cloud is such a gentleman!!"

I felt like a lady!

Haha! I got a bit carried away and decided to act elegantly!

<b>

When the wife asked, "Who are you?" I thought I would greet her like a lady.

<b>

But since I didn't know the Western-style greeting of lifting my skirt, I followed Japanese business manners...

I straightened my posture, placed my hands in front of my body, looked into her eyes, introduced myself, and bowed politely.

<b>

How was that? I thought it was a beautiful posture!

<b>

The wife kindly returned the introduction.

<b>

"Nice to meet you, I'm Sonia Cloud, Howard's wife. Nice to meet you, Suzy-chan. You're such a cute girl."

<b>

I received an incredibly soft smile! I felt so happy!

<b>

Huh? Wait? A cute girl? Am I being treated like a child again?

<b>

Speaking of which! I hadn't realized until now that I had no one to compare myself to... Am I short?

I can tell Mr. Cloud is really tall, but... my eye level is around Sonia-san's chest, right?

Is there more than a 10-centimeter height difference?

<b>

As I thought about that while smiling like a lady, Sonia-san rushed over with a worried look when Mr. Cloud referred to me as "the one who saved my life."

<b>

Ah, I'm fine already!

...Just as I was about to deepen my smile, it suddenly hit me!

<b>

<b>

Gurugyururururururururururururur...

<b>

<b>

Guhahhh!! (Coughs up blood)

<b>

This (stomach) is betraying its master not just once, but twice!?

<b>

Indeed, ever since I entered this property, an amazing aroma has been wafting through the air! I was holding back as my mouth was about to flood!

<b>

What is this timing, both just now and earlier!?

What is this loud noise!?

<b>

I was trying so hard to behave like a lady... and now it's all ruined!!

<b>

Moreover! To make that noise in front of the real lady I just met, Sonia-san, my skin peeled off in an instant!!!

What is this humiliation play!? I can't lift my face!!! Uhi~~~~~n!!!

<b>

<b>

As I trembled with shame, someone next to me burst out laughing with incredible force!!!

<b>

Uwaaa... I can't believe it! I can't believe it, Mr. Cloud!

You knew I was hungry, didn't you!?

And yet, you laugh like that!!!

...Ah, I'm about to cry.

I'm going to cry, okay? I'm going to cry!!

<b>

<b>

As I was trembling, Sonia-san came over and wiped my face.

...Ah, my beautiful apron is getting dirty...

Did she wipe it off before I started crying?

<b>

Sonia-san is really a kind person!

<b>

<b>

In the end, I was allowed to take a bath.

A bath!

I've been bathing since I got here, but this is my first time in a proper bath! I'm getting a little excited.

<b>

When I arrived at the bathroom, a person named Elrose was preparing the bathtub.

<b>

Compared to the slim Sonia-san, Elrose-san was a woman with a solid physique.

Not that she was fat, but how should I put it... she had a "strong mother" vibe? She gave off a sense of strength.

Is she a bit taller than Sonia-san?

<b>

She had black hair mixed with gray, tied tightly into a bun on top of her head.

Is she older than Sonia-san? Not in her 60s, right?

<b>

After leaving me with Elrose-san, Sonia-san said she would go get some clothes and left the bathroom.

<b>

<b>

Elrose-san placed her hands on her hips, gave me a once-over from top to bottom, then huffed and told me to "raise your arms," so I did...

<b>

In an instant, I was stripped bare!

Before I could be surprised or embarrassed, I was picked up and placed into the tub.

<b>

The tub was only half full, but it felt nice to be submerged up to my stomach in a half-bath.

While in that state, warm water was poured over my head with a shower.

I let out a sound, but the warm shower felt so good that I couldn't help but go "Ah~~~~."

<b>

I felt like Elrose chuckled a little...

<b>

After that, my hair was thoroughly washed with shampoo, and my entire body was scrubbed with a big sponge.

I was completely washed without any part left unseen.

<b>

Yet! I was the only one feeling embarrassed?!

Elrose didn't seem to care at all.

It felt like she was very used to this kind of thing (like bathing children?).

Could it be that I'm being recognized as a child by her too?

<b>

<b>

As I was rinsing off the soap, Sonia returned with a change of clothes.

<b>

"Elrose, thank you. I'll take care of the change, so please prepare the meal."

<b>

While wrapping my body with the towel Sonia brought, she was giving instructions to Elrose.

Elrose bowed and immediately left the bathroom.

<b>

<b>

After being wrapped in a towel, Sonia brought out some kind of tool.

I thought it looked like a hairdryer, and it turned out to be a hairdryer!

<b>

Once my hair was mostly dry, Sonia began to help me put on the underwear she brought.

Whoa! Pink striped panties!

<b>

But putting on panties while being seen by someone is super embarrassing!

The bra is a sports type? It stretched like a shirt and fit perfectly.

<b>

"Oh? It seems to fit just right. I thought it would suit you, but I'm glad."

<b>

Sonia said that while watching me with a smile.

<b>

<b>

The dress was a light blue one.

I put it on from the skirt side, and it was helped over my head.

It had a round neck without a collar, with a white line around the neckline.

Since it was open at the throat, after putting it on, she tied the string going through it into a bow.

<b>

After that, she brushed my hair in front of the mirror.

Now that I think about it, this was my first experience with brushing.

It felt nice, but I was too shy to look at myself in the mirror.

<b>

Sonia seemed to be in a good mood the whole time.

She was happily brushing my hair, but her gentle gaze made me feel even more embarrassed.

<b>

After brushing, she tied my hair back with a beautiful light blue ribbon.

<b>

"I apologize for making you wait."

<b>

Sonia led me to the dining room, and at the entrance, I apologized to Cloud for making him wait.

Cloud looked at me in surprise.

<b>

Well, I mean, I was polished up! I can understand why he looks like he can't believe his eyes, but please don't look at me so much, it's too embarrassing!

<b>

After being guided to a seat by Elrose, a paradise spread out before me!

The savory aroma of chicken and the tantalizing scent of spices!

<b>

Danger!! Saliva alert! Nearby individuals should be on high alert and keep their mouths away!!

<b>

Ah, excuse me. I leaned forward too much...

<b>

Howard gave me permission to eat.

Elrose cut up the chicken and placed it on the plate in front of me.

<b>

As the chicken was cut open, the aroma of the vegetables and herbs inside burst forth!

The scent that came with the cut chicken attacked my nostrils directly.

<b>

I felt dizzy. I'm sure from the outside, it looked like my eyes were swirling.

<b>

I cut a piece into bite-sized pieces and brought it to my mouth.

Is it alright to eat?

You won't say it's not okay, right?

You won't suddenly say "Just kidding!" or something, right!!?

<b>

I looked at Cloud.

He smiled and nodded vigorously.

Alright! I'm eating!! I took a big bite.

............................................................　............................................................ Mmmmmm!!!!

What a juicyyyyy taste! Delicious! So good!! Mmm, it's amazing!!

The meat juice is bursting! The sides of my tongue are tingling!!

The umami! The umami!!

<b>

Ah! This omelet-like thing is also delicious!!

What is this exquisite saltiness!?

Ahhh! To have flavor like this is such happiness!!!

<b>

My hands! My mouth! They won't stop!!

Ugh... It's so delicious! Hauguh...

I can't help but... Huh, I'm crying... It's so good...!!

<b>

In any case, I just kept eating! Crying and eating...

I thought this was the first time I had ever eaten something so delicious.

The happiness of the emotion made me cry uncontrollably!!

<b>

Sonia and Elrose took care of my meal together.

I felt like a toddler! I couldn't help but think that.

But it felt so good that I just let them take care of me.

<b>

Sonia's motherly instincts were incredible as she wiped away my tears and food scraps.

From now on, I'll secretly call her Sonia Mama in my heart!

<b>

<b>

<b>

After the meal, the tea Elrose made was also delicious...

<b>

That's right, there was tea in this world too! I completely forgot until now.

I learned for the first time that delicious tea after a meal can make someone so happy.

<b>

While I was basking in the afterglow of happiness, Cloud was telling Sonia about what happened today.

When Sonia and Elrose heard about me cutting down the wolves, they looked surprised with wide eyes.

Well, I just cut them down with Cloud's sword, though...

<b>

...And it seems Cloud plans to take me somewhere after this... to a temple?

<b>

Is it time to say goodbye to Sonia and Elrose? We just became acquaintances... Huh? He'll be back soon? Oh, I see... Hehe.

<b>

Huh? What? Venison steak?! Uwaaa! I'm getting excited...

Ugh! Sonia just called me a glutton...

Guh, it's confirmed that Elrose sees me as a growing child!

<b>

Ah, but still, it's nice to have everyone eat together like this.

It's not just delicious, it's fun too.

<b>

I'm looking forward to dinner now, huh? No, I'm looking forward to the venison too!

But I also think... that this kind of thing is nice... yeah.
